0,"I'm giving two stars simply because the capo does what it's intended to do to an extent. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.

First of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.

Secondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.

Thirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.

You can get a better capo for the same or less money.",0
1,"Yes, it is possible to tell the difference between this mic stand and, say, a Snicker's wrapper, but you have to have decent eyesight or be at close range.

In all seriousness, this is a very inexpensive mic stand, and might be the only one this cheap that is made of metal. Before you buy it on that fact (as I did), remember that tinfoil is also ""made of metal."" This stand will remind you more of tinfoil than the quality mic stands you may have used. Don't expect the stand to be heavy or to stay put once set up; it weighs less than some of my mics. It gives the ""I could bend this with my bare hands"" feeling.

Next issue: the paint on the threads binds with the mic clips you put on, and when trying to get them off, the entire thread tip of the stand twists inside the tubing that contains it. Unbelievable. I had to use pliers to grip the thread head just to get my mic off, and now the thread head is loose.

For cheap stands, I've had a couple of lightweight ProLine stands that have lasted a few years, and dollar for dollar I think DR Pro stands are pretty great. My advice is spend $70 on a mic stand if you're planning to use it for more than a week.

Two stars because it IS very, very inexpensive. Might be among the cheapest stands money can buy. And if you're going to put one lightweight mic on the end and never move it (or switch clips), I'd even recommend it. But if you're like me and put medium/large mics on a stand and move it from time to time, $30 is a lot to pay for a week's use out of a mic stand.",0
2,Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well.,0
3,"I tried to ignore the other reviews, but I had the same issues it stays out of tune most of the time. The fretboard feels very cheap in my opinion it feels like a mixture of fake wood and real wood. The max volume on this guitar is also significantly lower than the 3 other guitars I own as well. The neck pickup is also very close to the fretboard as well, which may affect the intonation as well. The strings are also cheap, but I was expecting that. The only thing this guitar got going is that it's really light-weight, it's lefty, and the guitar looks nice; but those are the only positive features. However if you want to spend $5 less and want a better cheaper guitar that's actually really good for the price, I recommend a guitar from ""Legacy""; that's still my favorite guitar and it shreds this guitar in my opinion, stay away from this guitar.",0
4,"I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.",0
5,"Stopped working after only 2 1/2 months.  Still has power (bought the power adapter), but suddenly last week the line in/out stopped working.  Tested all cables so it is somewhere inside of the unit.  Kills the signal whether it's active or bypassed, output A or direct output.  Just poor quality.",0
6,I had to disassemble them all when they came in. The plastic port hole covers were floating around inside the speaker.,0
7,"They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.",0
8,"This tuner didn't hold up over time.  Quit working after 1 year.  Also, it gets interference from loud audio sounds.
I would recommend just going with the boss tu-2 tuner. There's a reason you see everyone using it.",0
9,"Yes.  I saw the bad reviews on the 2nd Generation Scarlett devices.  Yes.  I waited until MAYBE new improved drivers came out (which did).  So when a good sale came up, I bit.

And I'm sorry to report that YES, this product is still broken in the driver dept.

First off.  Tech Support is useless, both in attitude and and technical understanding.  And they could care less whether you end the call with a broken product and trying to work things with you and a Level 10 tech God they may have locked up in the back room.

As it is, my Win8 PC is rock solid and works with other audio input devices.  The latest being an iRig Pro HD.  You plug it in, install the ASIO4ALL drivers and you're off and running.  My guitar signal goes to the iRig to PC to external speakers running off of my Creative sound card.

Interesting thing I learned from Tech Support is that you CANNOT run the 2i4 in this manner (guitar>iRig. PC>speakers).  With the 2i4, you have to go guitar>2i4> usb to PC and then external cable from 2i4 to PC speakers!  PITA if I want to use my sound card on my PC for anything else as I'll then need a splitter for the speakers and fussing in the settings to make the changes.

But guess what?.....Despite Tech Support's ineptitude, my tech skills got me to getting it to work hlaf way I guess.  I got sound out of it from the headphone oand Out ports in the back but the sound was WEAK in volume.  It was anemic versus the sound i got from my iRig Pro.

Yes.  Back it goes.  Drivers suck.  Tech Support sucks and the device isn't as as simple as my iRig to get guitar sound while not having to lose the ability to use my sound card for other things.

My observation lead me to witness  these new 2nd Gen. devices are going on sale like there's no tomorrow.  There's a reason for this!  Problems galore.  Buyer beware!

If you want sanity, go my route with the iRig or get the Steinberg and Behringer devices that get good reviews and BETTER drivers.  After all, without good drivers, the device becomes an expensive brick!",0
10,"Maybe I just got a bad one, but this bridge is poorly finished. There are extreme stamping striations at the rear of the bridge where the adjuster screws pass through. These striations are really severe. Also, the bottom side of the bridge is a mess. I know that you'll never see it once mounted, but it just adds to the fact that this (these) bridge(s) are poorly made with little or no attention to quality control. This bridge is unacceptable, especially for an item that is ""Made in USA""....or so they claim. The workmanship is so poor that I'm beginning to wonder if this may be a fake. Whatever the case, this bridge isn't going on my '54 build. Unfortunately, this bridge sat unopened on a shelf in my shop for a couple of months during which time the return window for Amazon had closed. That's my fault. I should have inspected the part immediately so I wouldn't be stuck with it. The bottom line here is that it's up to you. You can take your chances and buy this bridge from Amazon, but I would inspect it immediately. A better route would be to buy it locally and check it for quality before handing over your dinero. BTW-I snapped some photos hoping that I could include them in this review only to find that video is the only option.",0
11,"Garbage. First unit didn't work. Second is super noisy. Output is in mono, so if you attach headphones to it it'll just play out of one side. The adapters to fix this on Amazon were all crap. Don't waste your time. Just get something decent. You bum!",0
12,"This pad is waste of money even at a dime per piece. A dish washing foam pad that you get a dozen for a buck from a $.99 store would be better. There is no way to attach it to a violin. No instruction of use. Just a small piece of very soft foam. Hard to believe Amazon would sell things like this as a ""product"".",0
13,"This is G7th's little brother to the G7th G7 Performance 2 capo which I own and love. This barely works on a guitar, at least a good acoustic one. It's too weak and flimsy in comparison to the same capo they make and market as the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo....that's the one you want, and it will be the last capo you will ever use or buy. I needed a backup, and this doesn't qualify as a worthy capo on any level. You can tell the difference in size and weight....the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo is more expensive, is heavier in weight and in girth. I wasted good money on this not knowing they added this cheap junk to get folks to buy in at a lower price point....$67 for the ""good one,"" versus $37 for this junk. Buyer beware!",0
14,"Delivered WITHOUT the belt clip, then call it loop. People if you return an item, Please send all parts back.",0
15,"Should have checked it out in person, kind of flimsy, definitely not too roadworthy, spend more  $, recommend Ultimate stands.",0
16,"We bought these microphones hoping that we found a decent microphone for the price, in fact we bought two (3) packs. As far as vocals it has no range and is very, very quiet compared to other microphones. As far as construction they are cheap in quality. Frail wiring and horrible internal parts, and really light body. Not happy at all, If you don't care about how your voice sounds, or your trying to embarrass someone, or your using it for a prop, go ahead and buy it, but if you are a performer that cares about how your voice is heard, I would run away from this bargain!!! I don't even think they are worth trying to resell.",0
17,"Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk.",0
18,Blow,0
19,"it will function, but it takes a lot of manipulation to keep the strings from buzzing...not good for a ""quick-change"" of songs during a performance.",0
20,"Piece of junk. The rubber had to be stretched to fit over the bridge of my 4/4 violin. When I would pull it off, the bridge would move out of place.",0
21,"I am sending it back today.  The buttons are bad.  sometimes they would work and sometimes they didn't.  I would rather have a switch 3, but they are on back order.",0
22,"This stand was a bummer.  Opened it up and was hoping to use it as a stand for my Korg Monotron Delay.  Basically what I found out was that this stand won't hold onto anything.  It can't clamp on to the microphone stand....so what's the point of it?  It's worthless.  I finally managed to clamp it on to one of my mic stands (I have 3 different ones, it didn't work with any) and then I barely put my finger on it.  Guess what happened?  That's right, it came crashing down onto the ground.  Right now it's sitting on the floor, buried behind who knows what, and I'll never use it again.  A very very bad product, surprised it's a quik lok product.",0
23,VERY VERY HOT.,0
24,"When I first attached this adapter, the PC recognized it and installed drivers, but as soon as I attempted to send any MIDI data through it (tried 3 different controllers) the PC would drop the connection and then give me the 'unrecognized device' message.  After a bit of online research, I found a driver that corrected the problem and I was able to use it for about a half-hour.

When I went to connect it again however, I first got the 'unrecognized device' and then NOTHING.  I attempted connecting to 3 other PCs (XP & Win7) and none of them even see that a device is attached (though the power led is lit).

At less then six dollars, it's not even worth my effort to send this hunk of garbage back (FYI, it's not eligible for exchange).  Instead, I will be avoiding this seller in my future Amazon orders.",0
25,"I purchased the Rode SmartLav+ as an upgrade to the original SmartLav. I kept an old iPhone 4 to use as just a recording device to use with the Smart Lavs. It's a wonderful concept to save money by recycling an old iPhone with an inexpensive microphone. and have the convenience of planting the mic on your talent. However, I am disappointed with the audio quality of both microphones. The SmartLav+ is an improvement over the original because Rode eliminated the very objectionable noise from the original SmartLav. The noise level was so high that it made the microphone virtually unusable in a quiet environment where the mic noise would be easily heard. So, the SmartLav+ is indeed much quieter than its predecessor. However, the human voice recorded by the mic sounds rather ""tinny"" and missing some frequencies. Applying EQ helps a little but not enough. My friend own the $200 Rode professional lav mic and we made a side-by-side comparison, recording into a Tascam DR-40 for the balanced pro lav mic and an iPhone 6+ for the SmartLav+. The difference was astounding! Now I have such low regard for the SmartLav+ that I will only use it as a backup or in a situation where the convenience overrides the audio quality. I am an owner of several other Rode microphones and love the company, but I think for the $70 that this costs they could have built a little better audio quality into it. I think they mis-judged the market on this item.",0
26,"Pros: Doesn't drip. Fairly compact design, probably better for travel with a case than at home.

Cons: I don't like how far it spreads the strings to stay suspended (see photos). The product images on Amazon are clearly Photoshopped to show no string spreading at all. This is not the case. The material inside (more of a micro-fiber sponge than anything special) seems to lose it's moisture much quicker than advertised (they say you only have to fill it once a month).

I'll be looking for a better solution and manually humidifying the air in the meantime.",0
27,Is not a good product. You can find something better. Its hard to make that work fine. Its always with problems.,0
28,"I am very sorry to say this but IHO it is the worst strap I ever had, too thin, poor quality, back of the strap is not real leather,  and it is very short, if you're 6'1 tall like me you're not going to like it, sorry but it is the truth",0
29,"The sound is ok but the latency is slow, almost 1/2 a second between my pick attack and the sound going to my ear. I used it on an iPhone 5 with irig software so it may work better on something faster.",0
30,"My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.
But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route, but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also, since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings.",0
31,"This seems quite well thought out and seems quite complete, BUT, for a huge group of us that think this will be a big help, it just may be one more guitar instructional item that never gets used.  If you have a teacher or very experienced friend who knows theory and is willing to help you, by all means, consult them about this.  It may be a really good addition to your tool box.  If, on the other hand, you are teaching yourself or using some books, videos, and on-line courses to learn, this can be so under-explained that it is useless.  We are told it took the designer 15 years, if I remember correctly, to work it out, yet all we get is a very superficial set of instructions in using it.  None of the ""stars"" really tell you what it does or doesn't do.  No-one really goes through finding and pointing out how it shows this or that and the videos that are available are more selling promos with poor video quality.  We are told a book about it with instructions is in the works.  That will be nice, but for now I'd rather have some readable books then this tool.  Yes, it is not very expensive, but if you buy it, open it carefully (from the bottom) and be sure it is a positive item for you before deciding to keep it.  Oh and yes, one thing I thought it would do was already confirmed as not doing by the company.  Not my cup of tea but maybe it is for you.",0
32,Sucks. Get the iPhone guitar tuner. Works great and simple to use!!!!!,0
33,Not my style for what I play (rock).,0
34,"I have had mine for about 2years. I do think the sound quality itself is pretty useable, also quite versatile as well. Unfortunately, mine also developed the flashing LED syndrome, it does seem to go way after it has been on for a while. I am looking into replacement (obviously not a reverb pedal from Behringer) as I am not sure when it decides to kick the bucket all together. They must know this is a problem, they should be actively recalling or offer replacement with owners of this product but they could careless about ripping their consumer off with defective product. I also had the pitch shifter pedal form them, that also died after about 6 mouth. It is great that they are making these pedals available at a lower price but they should also acknowledge defective products and take responsibility to have them repaired or replaced with ease. On the other hand  can just imagine them laughing reading this at the Behinger headquarters, not much point posting a review like this one.",0
35,Not as expected. My old chromatic tuner was set up for a stand on the back. I was under the impression this tuner would have a stand also. Did not return because postage would have cost me to return to seller.,0
36,"the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.
don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES",0
37,i've had them for less than a week and they broke. probably because it is hickory,0
38,"I bought this amp twice in one week - first one I purchased was dented and the fans didn't run, only channel A put out sound.  Returned it to amazon, bought a replacement, opened this one... same problem, dented case, ""void if opened"" sticker was half peeled off and channel B was the only one to work this time..... from the looks of the reviews on this site, I am not the first, and probably won't be the last to be ripped off on ""re-packaged"" broken amps that obviously the manufacturer is trying to offload on the unsuspecting.... boo Pyle!!!!!",0
39,"UPDATED JAN 2018
Downgraded from 5 stars to 1 - disappointed with the new design
These are no longer the same dimensions as the 'Neotech 8301052 Mega Bass Strap, Black' the neoprene is now shorter and the leather on the front is also a different length now! The adjustment on the back of the strap was at the bottom which was easy to adjust while wearing the bass, now it's at the top so you have to remove the bass to adjust the length of the strap. I don't think these changes were well thought out at all, maybe this was a cost saving change more than a quality of product change... very disappointing

The beauty of the original design was that if you had a bass with a heavy neck it would eliminate 'neck dive' e.g. - Warwick Thumb with Wenge neck - the new strap design has much less neoprene to 'grip' to your clothing.  Now searching for a better alternative :-(

WOW WOW WOW!
Very pleased with this strap, don't know why I waited so long to replace my old strap as it was killing my shoulder. The Neotech is extremely comfortable and makes my heavy headless bass feel feather-light now!

The materials are nice and soft, distributes the weight well and stays in place.  The leather ends are very thick and stiff, which made it tough to get them on but they certainly won't fall off, so don't think I need strap locks :-)

American Made, nice quality.",0
40,"Well, it would be a nice case if the latches worked properly.
They don't however, so I'm sending it right back. The latches are crooked, do not engage properly, are difficult to close, and pop open all on their own. I'm not entrusting this case to keep my Tele secure.",0
41,"I clicked on a strap with the locking ends.  When I changed the color aparently it changed it to a strap without the locking ends.  Bad glitch with the system, the strap is fine for a non locking strap but that's not what I ordered.",0
42,"Two pedals in a row were defective. The first wouldn't power on at all unless I removed the back cover and let extra light in, and the second only works when the contour wah button is engaged. Otherwise the signal cuts out completely. That started happening only a few hours after I got it. Right out of the box it worked fine...didn't change anything aaand now it doesn't work. I'm getting pretty tired of sending these things back. Never had an issue with a pedal before, even the cheap crappy ones. It's like Morley has zero quality control or doesn't test them properly before they leave the shop.",0
43,"Before you waste your money, this stand does not work!!  The keyboard will not attach to it, merely balances(sort of) on it and will fall off!!
Keyboard requires the LC3 stand which sells for $ 29.00+.  It will actually screw onto this stand and the stand itself is much more stable.  I have no idea why Yamaha even sells this stand as part of this package but they will not take the X-frame back for a credit towards the purchase of this stand.",0
44,ok,0
45,Doesn't really do anything. I still just feel like it muffled the sound like other ear plugs. Just my opinion.,0
46,"didnt work with my setup,not universal",0
47,I have used hundreds of different tuners and I'm not a fan of this.  It's not sensitive enough to pick up some of the strings and I use it on my guitar which should be perfect.  It doesn't stay lit long enough for you to know if it's in tune.  My 24 years of guitar experience says don't buy this.,0
48,"Not bad sound, bad design. No way found to mount this at snare height. Four different snare stands and seven different cymbal stands and no luck so far",0
49,"2 months in, squeaks. Buy something else.

RMA? Sure but you'll pay for shipping. Casio makes a nicer one. Buy that.",0
50,"So this work all right.  Build quality is ok.  I've had to re-glue the black pads now as they don't seem to want to stay adheared to the metal.

Overall, this hasn't been my favorite capo due to:
1.) it's not as easy to clip on and it sometimes pops out of my hands while I'm trying to get it positioned on the neck.  now that I have a Taylor 214, I'm worried that it might damage the neck during one of these shenanigans.
2.) it doesn't fully press the strings unless you move it around while testing until you get a good sound
3.) For some reason, it doesn't sound as good as other capos with the strings having sort of a tinny, buzzy sound even after getting in the best place between frets.

Overall, I would not recommend or buy this again and am planning to give it to my son with my old guitar.",0
51,This mic worked for 2 years then just DIED! It was never dropped or mishandled in anyway. It was kept in the case when not in use. What a piece of JUNK! Save your money! If I could give it ZERO stars I would.,0

53,"I'm disappointed in the quality.  I purchased the professional version of this unit for my Church as we were setting up a studio a year ago.
I was very impressed with the quality for a reasonable price ('bout $30).
Now I'm setting up a small studio at home and I needed a stand.  I didn't need the spider holder for condenser mics since I'm using a dynamic mic.
So I chose this one thinking it was the same stand.  Boy was I wrong.  This thing is CHEAP and flimsy.  The worst part is where the stand inserts in to the base.  There is no bushing so the stand just flops around even with the nut tightened.  Very POOR.  If this  included a 1c plastic bushing for this I couldn't complaint because of the low price.  I thought about sending this one back and paying $15 for a much better stand.  So I started looking at those too.  It appears that Neewer's quality has really taken a dive.  All of the stand arms appear to be the same as what I have but some come with a XLR  and they are labeled ""broadcast"" quality.
Sorry Neewer; won't purchase again.",0
54,"Way too short for an acoustic.  I'm 5'10"" of average build and it's about 6"" too short, and that's on a Taylor 110, which is not a huge guitar either.  My fault, I should have double checked the length before i ordered it.  But then again, I've been playing for  40 years and never bought a strap that's too short, so I just didn't think about it.  Other than that, it's a nice strap, and the leather has a different look on each side, one side is much more distressed leather look than the other.  I guess I'll rig some kind of extension.",0

64,"The stand is as sturdy as any I have ever used.  I mean this thing is built!  But the pad, not good.  I love Remo and have used their heads for 40 years but this pad has NO response.

Sad to say, I don't hold the same opinion for the nanoPAD2 - the pads aren't too sensitive, the touch controller on the left side is pretty cheesy, and the unit I received wouldn't do the factory default key-change function on one pad properly, so back it went.

If you are on a dirt cheap budget, then maybe you can live with the shortcomings of this unit, but why not invest a bit more to get something that you'll enjoy using?

For the life of me I can't figure out why. This is a marginal Flanger.
I have owned 2 of these Flangers: an original & a reissue.
Thought the reissue would be better. It wasn't at all.
There's not enough ""swirl"" & the Flanging effect is weak.
The only good thing about this Flanger is the construction.
If you are SERIOUSLY looking for a Flanger try a ADA Flanger.
The ADA is the absolute ""Kabala"" of Flangers. It kills.
My second choice for Flangers would be a Hartman.
The Hartman is good but it has a huge volume bump.
I've been playing for a long time & I'm a ""Flanger Guy"".
I know what Flangers do & I know how they're suppose to sound.
You don't use a Flanger all the time so they gotta be right.
The MXR Flanger trys hard but is weak with a minimal sweep.

74,This came broken even though the package was in perfect shape! It seems cheaply made with cheap plastic. I would look for something of higher quality. This was a disappointment.,0
75,These strings suck. The strings looked more pink than red. Also they felt awful and sounded awful. They felt like 3 year old strings and sounded really dull. It's all caused by the paint on the strings. I'm pretty sure they just spray paint them. Not worth the price tag.,0
76,"I bought this after seeing a similar stand at a rehearsal and liked the idea of the clips that hold the guitar in.  I've had some of the cheaper everyday guitar stands, and had them knocked over in winds, people tripping on the stage, etc.  Thought this would be more stable.  With both of my basses on it, I didn't like how one of the basses would always hit one of the legs of the stand.  Also, if I removed one of the basses, the other bass would shift the balance of the stand and make it prone to tipping over.  I'm going to be returning this and probably get two single guitar stands.",0

84,"Cons: Okay, used these for recording. Literally, LITERALLY, the first 15 minutes, all of the whips came out. We used duct tape, like, a lot of duct tape, and they still kept falling out. I'd recommend ripping them out and regluing them in with your own super glue. Vater did send me a free pair when I told them about the problem (unless they've changed their glue, these will likely come apart too). Not the only pair that this has happened with.

Pros: Sounds AMAZING. Been drumming and recording for over a decade and never had such a positive sound. The engineer even commented on the great sound. Very precise and effective ""thwack"" that isn't as aggressive and prominent as a stick, but no where near as light and lame as a brush. Great for a non-distracting but effective presence..",0

94,"This PA head has all the ""features"" you would want. Reverb, delay, 4 channels, etc. However, to get the effects to work to the point where they actually sound like effects requires turning all the control knobs up all the way. Another quirk is if you want only delay, you can't get it unless you turn up the reverb control. What? Anyway I finally got it setup for my practice room with my piano and it sounds good. But this head would never work in a band or rehearsal setting since it's underpowered and the effects are quirky to manage and set. Best bet is to go buy a straight PA head with no effects and then buy a mixer with built in effects. It will cost more but you get what you pay for. BnB Beatles Depot",0

Then I was only able to find one store in the UK that has the driver for this very popular speaker. Behringer showed it as coming soon on their website, yet the behringer speaker models that use this same horn driver have been around since 2007.  The total after shipping puts me within $70 of the price for a whole new speaker.  That is extremely poor after the sale customer service.

102,"The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16.",0

112,"My first impression after opening was a mixed bag. I really liked how it looked, but, it felt very light and toyish in my hand. First noodlings on this were impressive when hooked up to speakers, the sound quality this thing generates are very clean and good. Controls are intuitive but would take some time to really tweak to your own personal flavor but the 150 presets are fun. I played with this for about 5 hours making dance songs and some cool ambient tracks and the batteries were almost dead. Now the reason I purchased was really to be able to record other devices like my microkorg and guitar and loop all together while overdubbing little tidbits from this. For me personally it failed. The microphone feature is cool but it takes two people to use effectively and the sound quality was sub-par. The loop banks need to be held down to record ( basically loosing a hand ) and once you overdub a loop bank its forever. Meaning, if you lay a drum track then a bass line on loop one then decide to throw in a synth lead over them but don't like how the synth lead turned out you cant simply just delete the synth part, you have to delete the whole loop and start over. Now anyone who has played on Korg X-Y pads know that it is a crap shoot when it comes to playing the exact thing twice, it takes a lot of practice so this really turns out to be what I had expected, a really cool music toy. There are a lot of features on this that make it appealing and I am no Kaossilator expert but for the money they are asking and the cons that I talked about earlier it lasted one day and I returned it. Remember this is my opinion and I really wanted to like it but I couldn't justify keeping it when music gear is so expensive and I could spend my money on something else that would work better for me.",0

117,"I loved this thing when I got it. Powerful enough to practice in a decent-size room, all the knobs you need, it's adorable and seems durable. Then a week later, there's the sound of something clattering around inside the box. I'm an electronics person, so I went to open it up- and oh wow.

Inside the box, the speaker is held onto the front by a few cheap metal clips screwed into the plastic. These screws are not properly placed so if you move this unit around at all you will eventually break the speaker free and it'll beat around the inside with 4 sharp metal screws stuck to the magnet on the speaker. Beautiful, right? It hurts the sound quality when the speaker is rattling around loosely. It's difficult to reattach the speaker, because the screws broke off the plastic they were embedded into. You'd have to glue it in place since the screws won't hold.

The rest of the unit? Oy. There are loose wires covered in hot glue trying to make sure the loose screws won't short something. If I didn't know any better I'd think this was a 1980s Chinese bodge job trying to rip off a real American brand. A few months later, and miniscule movements of the cords cause cracking and popping because the innards are working loose.

I'm tossing this unit and upgrading to something that's built correctly inside. If you really need a dirt-cheap unit, get someone who knows what they're doing to crack it open and cover the innards with more hot glue to hold everything in place- especially the speaker.",0

120,"I have had fine success with the joyo crunch distortion, and was in the market for a nice delay to thicken some surf guitar tones with a nice slap back effect. I thought this would fit the bill. Sadly it is almost unusable. Let me explain:

The good: the construction seems study and fine, the controls are responsive and easy to dial in, the delay can self oscillate which I always think it's cool.

The bad: there is a huge tone change when the pedal is engaged. It literally spikes the treble probably 60%. If it were only a little brighter than the dry signal I would've kept it but this change was extremely noticeable. I had a basic flat eq set on my amp and it's like I cut the bass control to zero and maxed my treble when I turned it on. Just terrible.

Maybe I just got a bad one, but either way I returned it for a refund and used the money towards another brand of inexpensive delay (the moen pretty dolly, which doesn't self oscillate but has very nice warm delays and doesn't change my dry tone when engaged). I love joyo's dirt pedals but this delay didn't work out at all. Hopefully I just got a bad one and you'll be just fine, but buy with caution anyways.",0
121,"Pros:

1. It looked good on my jazz bass.

2. It installed right into the existing mounting holes

3. The grooves for the saddles height screws keep the saddles from sliding around. This has been an issue on some Fenders I've owned with a smooth plate under the saddles.

Cons:

1. The saddles are very large, in comparison to standard Fender saddles, for example. As a result, the action of my bass was very high. I was able to get it low enough (but higher than my preference) by setting the saddles as low as they went, and then shimming the neck. If the saddles were smaller, this would be less of an issue.

2. Eventually, the bridge bent right behind the screw mounting holes, and the rear of the bridge started lifting. At this point, I took it off and went back to a standard Fender bridge.",0
122,"After buying and liking the Joyo California Sound and British tone pedals, I sprang for this one since I like Fender cleans, and I was disappointed.

Both the Joyo CS and BT pedals will do a great amp clean tone when ran into my recording interface.  This pedal, regardless of settings, would not.  No matter where I set it, the tone was overdriven, and that's not what I was looking for.

I recently traded this pedal in at Guitar Center, and I don't miss it.  I will say that it's build quality seemed on par with my other Joyo pedals, and I've not had any trouble with them.

So, if you're looking for a amp-like clean tone from a pedal, skip this and consider the British Tone or the California Sound.  But if you want that Fender-y overdriven tone, this might be right up your alley.",0

All guitar pedals use a standard barrel size adapter...usually a 5.5mm x 2.1mm (center negative) barrel connector. This makes using daisy chains or multiple output isolated power supplies like the Voodoo Labs Pedal Power or the BBE SupaCharger (and the many others) a simple way to power ALL guitar pedals requiring 9-18v of power.

I watched the only video's mon Youtube demonstrating the pedal...including several views of Valeton's official video for the pedal. The pedal sounded great...so I bought one on Amazon. I did notice one prior review that said the pedal came to the buyer and was a total lemon...not producing the sounds it was advertised as producing and in general sounded horrible and highly defective. Well guess what...my pedal came the same way. I was stoked to take it to a gig the night I received it and out of the box it was obviously the pedal was not quality controlled at the factory. The pedal when engaged produced a slight ""Overdrive effect"" with a barely discernable ""Swoosh"" sound. No Auto Wah sound at all....nothing close to the sounds on the Valeton official video...zero response from the pedal control...once engaged the pedal only made one sound...the slight Overdrive with a teeny tiny Swoosh sound in the background....no amount of re-clicking the engage button or controls made a difference. Disappointed? You bet. Buyers remorse? Yep. You get what you pay for...and for $55 I did expect a pedal that worked the way it was advertised...my guess is it was not quality control checked at all...or if it was it was still allowed to be shipped out.

The first gig sounded pretty good, except one of my speakers sounded weak...after tweaking it..there was a slight improvement..until the next gig, when it went nearly dead....

During the time I brought them in...the Yamaha simply make a slight pop sound when I turned it on..and went silent...then the repair shop called and said they could not find anything wrong with the speakers..and sure enough, when I plugged them into the Yorkville, everything sounded as it should.

133,I don't know what all the hype is over this thing.  The idea is good and its cute.  Its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out.  How many of these types of noise boxes do we need?  Not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it.  Go buy a 20 watt Roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also.  Or any combo little amp.  It's for bedroom use only.  You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire.  Being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you.

Yes, they last a long time, but the new sound can't compare with a conventional string.  To me they sound moderately fatigued from the beginning, with a loss of sparkle and high end.  On the 12 string they were acceptable, but that guitar had an abundance of highs to begin with.

If playing amplified with a pickup they sound OK, but otherwise I don't want an expensive new string that sounds somewhat tired from the beginning.  I'd rather use conventional strings and change them more often than play these.  The Cleartone strings to my ear sound much better.",0

It arrived in two days as promised but when I unpacked it, I am almost certain that it had been returned before because the tags were torn off and inside the body.

For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).

I've purchased several of these buttons for Schaller locks and they worked swimmingly. The last set I purchased looked right, but didn't fit the locks. I contacted Amazon and they sent another set right away. The replacement set also didn't fit (the circumference was too large).
I sent both button sets back and am now on the lookout for some different buttons.
I'm no longer able to recommend these for the Schaller system.

I picked these up for use with some Schaller locks that I've had for years. I installed them on a ES-339.

171,"Fri 12/30/2011 3:45 pm. The Yamaha MG102c is a lovely mixer, but it has a defect -- for my purposes -- which is shares with *numerous* other units: the ""monitor/phones"" output level is controlled by the master level; in this case, by the Stereo level. ... I took the trouble before purchase of downloading Yamaha's manual mg82cx_en_om.pdf, which says ""The PHONES jack outputs the same signal as the MONITOR OUT jacks"" which ""output the signals adjusted by the MONITOR/PHONES control"" and ""MONITOR/PHONES Control: Controls the level of the signal output to the PHONES jack and the MONITOR jacks; STEREO Master Control: Adjusts the signal level sent to the STEREO OUT jacks.""

I obviously don't know how to read these things, but I can't see anything in there about the ""Stereo Master Control also controls the headphone level"".

Many of the mixers are like this, although not absolutely all; I have no idea why. It was probably cheaper once, but I doubt that's an issue now, and it seems obviously advantageous to have independent control of the two levels, instead of one depending on the other. It would at any rate be advantageous to *me*. So I'm returning it.",0

177,"Sounds incredible for its size. Perfect portable amp for any kind of guitar sound anywhere you go... except it has one MAJOR FLAW: when running on battery power the amp shuts off when you turn the volume and guitar output up past half way.

Brand new set of Duracells, all of which measure well above 1.4volts. It's really such a stupid flaw too, that the engineers seem to have overlooked: whenever the voltage draw reaches a low enough point, the unit keeps shutting off and you have to manually turn it back on and then it fails again. Note: this problem does not occur when the unit is using its AC adaptor.

That alone is pretty much a deal breaker - I can't give a ""portable battery-powered"" amp any more than 2/5 stars if I can't even turn the thing up past half way for 3 or 4 hours and rock a picnic table at camp.

If you're looking for an awesome desktop amp and can use the included AC adaptor, look no further. But if you want battery-powered portability, I would not recommend this amp because it can't go much louder than the unamplified strings before it shuts down.",0

I thought oh I must have the tone control rolled back, nope. I checked my guitar cord, the amp. I had a thought they changed something so looked at the package and sure enough, it now says MADE IN CHINA. So, I dug up one of my regular Fender white Heavy picks and played it and the bright biting tone I loved so much from these picks was immediately there. Shame on Fender for trying to maximize profits and cut out the American pick makers to squeeze more money out of us musicians. These picks absolutely are the worst picks I've ever tried, they absolutely kill treble response and any kind of liveliness. I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad batch, so went to Musician's Friend and ordered another batch, they were identical and sounded horrible too.

No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear.  The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful.  On the other hand, the reverb from my Korg AX-100G (that I was using on another rig) was great.  Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly, but I don't think so.  I think that's the way it really sounds.  So I got a return authorization from Amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.

190,"My copy does not sit flat on the floor, it wobbles. The wobble is most pronounced at the lowest height settings, diminishing as the height is increased. This happens regardless of which toothed disc the upper arms are attached to. (The two discs allow the reversing of the upper arms. The arm assembly may need to be reversed for best balance, depending on the height the stand is set at.) Note: I have a Quick-Lok keyboard stand that solves wobble problems by employing eccentric feet that can be rotated to compensate for an imperfect stand or uneven floors. Simple and clever.

This stand does not adjust finely enough to hold an amp in a level position, a major reason for its purchase. It gets close, but the locking teeth lack enough adjustment resolution to dial it in.

Please note that Amazon's image of this product apparently shows the upper part of the rack rotated to an incorrect position. (Perhaps that's because instructions are not included.) The cross-brace should be under the amp.",0

In other words, no B, C, D, F, E sharp, Open A, Open C, Open D, Open F, Cross Note C, Cross Note D, anything that requires you tune a string to C or F.

When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, ""You ruined the event."" I took full responsibility but no, I didn't. Sure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. The worst part is, for $100 more I could have got the nice RE2 from EV which has awesome ratings and lasts for 10+ years. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store Chinese junk.

The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go ""flat"" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.",0

I'm using it on a Taylor 855CE, tuned a step low, with medium Elixer strings.  The problem is on the higher pitched octave strings.  The capo's rubber doesn't seem to yield enough to allow it to reach the narrower width octave strings, the rigidness on the wider strings don't allow it to  press the octave strings to the fret without enormous pressure, and even then, sometimes I can't get a clean sound.  I've considered trying to modify it by cutting or burning the rubber, but I'm afraid I would ruin it, and it has found a place in another 6 string case where it works perfectly (hence 2 stars instead of 1).

Not long after getting it, it started to buzz. I'm a pro musician with decades of experience with gear, so I know what to do to isolate problems, no question, this box was buzzing.

It is smoother sounding and easier to play than other key of ""A"" models I've played, but not as much of a difference between this and the D I've got, which blows away EVERY other D I've played.

Update:  A reed broke after 4 months of playing.  These things are supposed to last 5 times longer than regular harmonicas.  I guess other harmonicas are only supposed to last a few weeks?

First, the positives - it is well constructed, with good fit and finish. The padding which keeps metal from touching your guitar seems to be of good quality as well. And, well, it is a capo.

Now, the negatives - there is no pressure adjustment, and the pressure is very high. And the jaws don't open wide enough - barely wide enough at the 5th fret on my Martin D-28 and Breedlove Solo Concert, and really not wide enough at all on my vintage Yamaha FG-360. This means that if the capo fits at all, it is going to (and does) pull all your strings noticeably sharp.

I would return it except that the low price makes it not worth the return shipping to do so. As it is I will keep it with my old Yamaha, which is now my travel guitar, and either suffer with an out of tune guitar when using it, or retune as needed.",0

233,"The illustrations for this in the ad make it seem like the pattern covers a wide expanse; unless you're hanging it from 12 or 15 feet, it really doesn't, and quite honestly, comes off as quite hokey. I thought you could control the patterns, such that if you found one you liked, you could freeze it and leave it be. Not so. There are two modes; manual, which automatically changes the pattern, and audio, which changes the pattern per beat from music. There is a sensitivity knob, but that really just controls how fast the patterns change. And speaking of the patterns, I like the full on dots mode, but after that, it circulates through a bunch of straight line patterns, that for me were frankly boring.

When a connected device short-circuited, rather than trip the circuit breaker in the unit, it kept supplying voltage to short-circuiting device until it caught on fire and the the Furman M-8 Merit Series Power Conditioner exploded in flash of light scaring off the talent and requiring fire extinguishers.

Furman Customer Relations says these devices are designed ON PURPOSE to destroy themselves violently and explosively in order to ""save"" the attached electronics. It did one of these functions: it blew up, it didn't save the connected electronics. Why it couldn't work like any other device with a circuit breaker, and why even include one if it is supposed to ""self sacrifice"" (their words) to ""protect"" attached equipment.

The phrase ""the proof is in the pudding,"" e.g. ""how does it really perform in real-world conditions, not theoretically on-paper"" leaves this unit tasting like feces pudding. If Furman gave me a unit I wouldn't use it. The risk of accidental electrocution is just too high. Instead of the talent merely being scared, they could have been killed. Not worth the cost at any price.

On the plus side, it has a nice power cord and looks good.

Would have been nice to know that before I bought it, but it's not on the box, and it's not on the Amazon product info page.

I get really annoyed when products don't display their info upfront.  Amazon is at fault for this, yes, but so is this product.

It also didn't come with a battery.  Would be nice to know that.  Not everyone keeps a stock of watch batteries on hand.  If it was supposed to have one with it, I didn't get one.

Luckily, I can return this to Amazon for the price of a drive to UPS, but it's still a pain in the butt.

I'll probably get panned for this, which is a warning more than a review, but if it saves someone from buying it, or worse, from getting a weird spot on their headstock because of unsafe rubber used on the product, then it's worth it.

If you've got a guitar with finish that won't be affected (make sure!), and if you don't mind buying a battery, or if you miraculously get a battery with yours, cool.  It seems like a nice tuner.  Otherwise, beware.

The packaging sucked too.  I was surprised it wasn't broken.  So there!  Sorry, but I'm totally not impressed!",0

260,"Having owned other Line6 hardware and having good experiences with this I bought this device to take to work and jam at on my lunch break.  I regret this decision....

First, the good things.  It sounds pretty decent if you like to play rock or metal.  Its not great, but for jamming along with your mp3 player and practicing it works perfect.  There are a ton of different sounds you can coax out of this device.  Other people have complained about the interface but I don't have any troubles with it.  There are some features you can't manipulate unless you plug it into a computer and use their software, doesn't bother me though.  Its portable and runs on batteries.  All you need is your guitar, cable, and headphones.  Back-lit screen is nice and legible.

The bad:  The modulation effects are pretty cheesy and digital sounding.  Eats batteries very quickly  Clean sounds are just meh, but if you aren't using it for recording it should be fine.

Here my main beef:  The build quality of this device is not up to normal Line6 standards.  It is very flimsy cheapo plastic.  I'm still wondering where the real Line6 device is because this seems like a crappy cheap Chinese copy of a Line6 device.  I dropped mine onto indoor carpeting and the screen cracked, making it unusable.  Line6 considers this device to be consumable and will not help you fix it.  They tell you to use their authorized service center to repair...ok, I contact every single one on the list and they all tell me the same thing, deal with Line6 directly.  So I try, and Line6 tells you to use an authorized service center... I don't like being treated like this and playing these games.  I broke it an am willing to pay for a repair but they just want me to buy a new one.  Heck, sell me a new screen and I will solder it in myself (I work in electronics).  No go.  Digitech never treated me this way with any of their products, in warranty or not.

If you buy this be extremely careful with it.  I'm not joking, this thing is flimsy.  Its not high impact plastic... its thin and fragile.  If you have an issue, good luck dealing with Line6.  In this economy you'd think they would do whatever it takes to maintain customers but I guess thats not the case.  Their business model must make them immune to these things.

The Behringer speakers have apparently no shielding at all in the left hand speaker which is connected to the right hand side by a distincly non-optical connection.  End result is I now get the annoying cell phone buzzing happening in one speaker.

Fit and finish of the speakers is sub par, the knobs on the front of the speakers are wobbly and cheap feeling.  There is a input for earphones in the front of the right hand speaker, but it is quarter inch instead of the now more common eighth of an inch.

275,"Update: Very happy with Pioneer Ddj Wego3, a toy that works more reliably than this ""pro"" device. For some reason Numark dropped the ball on the Lightning connection, available since iphone 5?!?!, with zero acknowledgement of a known problem, repeatedly complained about on their own forum. Maybe I just got a dud, but I'm definitely not the only one, and I'll stick with my reliable toy.

Original review:
I rarely leave 1 star reviews but Man, I really wanted this to work, and it's just not reliable enough. There is a known problem with these devices, when you use with a lightning adapter. There is some kind of static/ground issue that creates a horrible rattly distortion, I honestly thought I blew my speakers the first time I heard it. And of course the first time it acted up like this, it was at the first gig I was using it at, after I had tested it at home with no problems. I seriously thought I blew my Bose L1 model 2, but then luckily I noticed the same static coming through the headphones, whew. It was obviously just the controller device, which sucked too, but a lot less catastrophic then a blown speaker system. Luckily when I pulled the plug on it and tried again, the static was gone. I figured it might have been a one time thing, but did a Google search on it, and on the Numark forums, what do you know, many people with the same problem. Simply unacceptable for professional use with lightning devices, which is insane. Yes, you can usually make the static go away, but I can't risk that and waste time on this, sometimes it doesn't go away completely until you power it off and on two or three times, and I'm talking pulling the power plug, not exactly great for speakers.

If you have the old 30 pin connector iPad, apparently it doesn't make that problem happen, although I know my iPad 2 runs incredibly slow nowadays. This product is just outdated, lightning connectors have been out for years now, no reason Numark couldn't have fixed this.

Physical build quality is very nice, definitely looks professional which is nice, I'm a mobile wedding DJ (no clubs or anything) so I don't really do any scratching or anything but having something to Crossfade, loop, queue up to beat match, with outputs and built-in iPad charger is very nice. I'm returning this and going to go with the Pioneer DDJ we go 3, hopefully that works out. The pioneer definitely looks more like a toy, but gets great reviews and heck, if it's a reliable toy and can do everything I need, I'll take that any day over a pro lemon. The upside of the pioneer is that it's a lot smaller too, so it will take up less of my small table space, the downside is, it just flat out doesn't look as impressive, at least I don't think, I haven't received mine yet.  Clients want to think you're using the best equipment so looks are somewhat important, but I can't Jeopardize a gig for looks.",0

281,Not Great. I Seem To Get Static From These doNNER Pedals. Returning It,0
282,"First of all, it is very flimsy and plastic feeling.  It doesn't have the solid feel of a normal pedal.  It's feels very fragile and cheap and I think the housing is just plastic and the only thing that may be metal is the back cover.  You have to go through 4 screws to get into it to put a battery in it.  When I first put a battery, it didn't even go in properly.  The lid wouldn't close back up because there is barely any room there.  Then I read the instructions and it said to place the battery a certain way and it seemed to work but the entire thing feels like a Chinese toy you buy at the mall or maybe IKEA comes to mind.  When I finally screwed the back plate back on, the screws wouldn't even go in properly and felt threaded and it wasn't a snug fit.  Basically the whole thing felt like it was going to fall apart.  The knobs are very cheap plastic too.

Now for the actual performance.  I too was sold because I saw some youtube videos where it sounded good.  Remember that you don't know what equipment they were using.  Sometimes if you have a really good guitar and amp (in the $$$ thousands range), it'll make anything sound good. I felt a little disappointed because mine sounded nothing like what was shown or reviewed on youtube.  I ran it in front of a tube amp and it still sounded very dry.  People think this is a complete overdrive but actually for me it wasn't enough distortion.  I play metal and even when the distortion was maxed out, I felt it was at about 50% of where I really wanted the distortion to be.  Does it sound like a Marshall?  I suppose but I've never played a Marshall before.  So may be it is some form of crude cheap man's similar sounding pedal.
Ultimately, it sounded very thin.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a lead pedal to supplement a baseline distortion but as I said there is not enough distortion to play leads.
The only trick I found to get it somewhat working was to turn it up.  It sounds better and richer when turned up.  I've never had a pedal where the sound changed this dramatically just because you turn up the volume on the pedal.

Ultimately, I felt that if you gig with this thing and you stomp on it like crazy, I'd suspect the thing would probably break.  It really does feel that plastic and weak.  It is very similar to those cheap toys you buy from a small booth in a mall",0

285,"It's great to mix in, but a real pain to record with. The auto-expanding layers on every take will make you lose track of where you are in the song and will fill your screen with countless layers you absolutely don't need to see.  To hide these layers, you have to stop everything, killing the flow of your recording session. Then, when you hit record again, all of the hidden layers return in full force.  This problem persists despite years of complaints and requests in their forums to disable it or at least make it an option. I was naive and thought they would eventually fix it, but they never have. They won't even comment on it, much less just make it an optional ""feature"" to auto-open the layers. It's clear to long term users they don't plan to ever fix it. Because of it, many folks record in a different program and only use Studio One for edits or midi composition.  If you are planning on recording, prepare to be disappointed because of the endless nightmare of auto-expanding layers cluttering your screen and hiding your work.  Otherwise, it's got some great features for mixing and editing.  Being such a good editing program makes it very frustrating that they ruined the recording workflow.

Very disappointing!

Update
========
Ok, here is the scoop.
Before you attempt to install EZ Drummer, fill your Pez dispenser with valium and prepare a large pitcher of margaritas.... you will need it!

1: First off , the CD installer is crap (see above).  You need to get the program from the TuneTrack website.
2: Before you can find or download the product from the website, you need to create an account and identify your sequencer (reaper for me).
3: Download EZ drummer from the ToonTrack site to your desktop and unzip.
4: Install EZDrummer from the msi installer (windows install).
  when the install is complete, the installer just disappears.... no desktop icons or hints what to do next.
5: Locate the pdf manual for EZ Drummer in the zip file you downloaded.
  The manual says the EZDrummer.dll (VST) is installed in the sequencer's (reaper) VST folder..... not correct
6: The VST is installed in C:\program files\VSTPlugin folder.
  You need to manually move/copy the EZDrummer vst to your sequencer's VST directory.
7: Upon starting your sequencer, your sequencer should find the EZDrummer dll.
  you will be prompted for serial number, computer name,... and online registration will occur.
8: With a little bit of luck, your install should only take one hour.
  It took me close to 4 hours to figure out how to work around the convoluted install process and many documentation errors.

301,"So last night at band practice, I passed this little tuner around to my bandmates.  We had it set to chromatic mode.  My guitar was close, but still out of tune.  The fiddle was close, but out of tune.  The banjo was horridly out of tune, and we tried three times.

Then we passed around my Korg Pitchclip.  Night and day difference.  I'm getting a couple more Pitchclips.

This tuner is probably fine for beginners, but not if you want a precisely tuned instrument.  It is simply not accurate enough.",0

I returned it for a Lexicon MX200 which is 3 times the price but with the Behringer I got what I paid for. BnB Beatles Depot",0

Let me tell you that I used to tend to throw half a dozen picks across the stage/room about every night I play.  Even Gorilla Snot didn't keep the darn things from going airborne.
Don't get me wrong, DAVA makes some other picks I really like.  The one I use most is the red(delrin)-tipped, black model 1303 pick.  But I cannot use these stupid ""grip"" picks for an entire night without the soft rubber coming loose from the hard plastic and turning the thing to junk.  The problem is, the soft rubber is needed in the center area of the pick, where the center of your grip is.  All that soft garbage around the edges is useless, unless it is for DAVA to sell a damn lot more of them than necessary.  The soft crap tears away from the hard plastic and then the whole thing comes apart.",0

Also, died 1 month after I would be able to return it, so I guess I'm out of luck

Update, forgot to mention. Before it died, I used this item on a music stand when I practiced guitar. The frequency of the flicker of the LEDs was sort of synced up with the frequency of some of the pitches.

355,"According to Presonus, the Audiobox 1818VSL Is incompatible with late 2013 and later Macs. I just bought an iMac 27"", and Logic Pro and audio input was horribly distorted at best. The problem is an incompatibility with Apple's USB 3.0 chipset.

I previously used the Audiobox with my 2008 MacBook Pro, and while it worked, there were issues with latency and random pops.

The following message is from PreSonus:

We have discovered that the Apple has made a fundamental design change in their latest release of computers including the iMac series 14,1 (late model 2013), Apple MacBook Air 6,2 (late model 2013) and MacBook Pro (11,1  13::11,2  15 :: 11, 3  15 ) (released October 22, 2013) are incompatible with PreSonus AudioBox VSL-series products.

The aforementioned MacBook Pro, iMac and MacBook Air models will not work with the AudioBox 1818VSL in either mode with VSL software installed or in class-compliant mode with no VSL software installed due to a problem with Apples hardware design that we cannot address.

No matter what i do, twist them partially, or put them on backwards whatever... these picks overall feel like clunky waste of time. Finger tips aren't perfectly round, and the shape of these is basically round around your fingers so it just feels lame. I might have to go for the press on nails that people glue onto their nails because I need a more natural feel, as if it's part of my fingers, not some thimble stuck on them... in fact I think thimbles would be better than these things.",0
393,"When it came to top quality in audio recording in the not too distant past, TEAC and subsequently their TASCAM subsidiary often came to mind. However, something has happened to the company over the years. Their products, while still nice in many ways, no longer offer the kind of quality and innovation that once was so prevalent. All too often the company stumbles as often as it succeeds. The TASCAM DR-22WL Portable Studio Recorder is a prime example of this.

Out of the box the recorder feels flimsy and overly light. Not that heaviness in a portable recorder is necessarily desirable. I just get the feeling that the DR-22WL might not handle reasonable abuse all that well.

The built in speaker quality is low. The speaker's audio is mono and the low level.  The tiny, tinny sound of the speaker makes playback very hard to hear.

The recorder's display is monochromatic and doesn't have a touchscreen. We've become very accoustomed to both color and touch screens with our iPhones, iPads and Android devices. This makes the interface appears dated.

The DR-22WL has a scene dial. It's unclear what this buys you that the menu system doesn't already handle. These kinds of pre-programmed dummy modes are bad enough when they appear on digital cameras. But now we see the same brain dead function moving to a recorder. Sad!

There are some technical omissions and strange marketing involved with the DR-22WL. For one thing, the external input jack is a combo Mic/Line, 3.5mm jack. Since the device is expecting a microphone, you run the risk of overloading the input should you wish to record from a line level input source. I guess you could just turn down the input gain to allow it to work with line-level sources, but this is problematic. The DR-22WL has a line level output jack, so why not provide a separate high level input jack? It's a glaring omission.

The next item is a bit technical, but try to stay with me.

The marketing folks want us to know that the DR-22WL is capable of recording a WAV file at 96K, 24-bits. That probably earns it the ""High Res"" (high resolution) logo that is plastered on the device's box. However, if you look closely at the recorder's specifications, you will see that the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the device is 92dB. While that figure in itself is quite good, it's about the same noise level that you get with a 16-bit recording. That makes it debatable as to whether 24-bit recording capability gives you any more resolution than 16-bit recording. In theory, 16-bit ought to give you 96dB from noise to clipping. That's a better noise level than the device itself provides. Therefore the lower noise floor resulting from 24-bit recording in other recorders offers no advantage with the DR-22WL.

What am I saying here in layman's terms? That switching to the so-called ""High Res"" file format is useless in the DR-22WL because the internal noise in the device is higher than the capability of the file format. In other words, it's all marketing!

WiFi remote access is a nice feature in a portable recorder. It saves you from removing the micro card and placing it (probably with an adapter) in your computer in order to copy audio files. However, Wi-Fi in the DR-22WL requires using a dedicated network and password. The network SSID is fixed. The password is changeable but not customizable. Neither is particularly easy to remember or type.

Most unfortunately the device can't simply use your exiting Wi-Fi router. That makes it more  complex to use the recorder and requires a network switch in order to remotely access the recorder. Of course, switching Wi-Fi networks blocks you from accessing Internet with whatever the iDevice you select to remotely access the DR-22WL.

On top of that, you need to download and install an app in order to access the device. As another reviewer put it, ""The app is free, but it does not support uploading the recorded files directly to any other service, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Facebook, etc. You can get a free SoundCloud account, but it comes with only a minimal amount of storage, and you'll have to pay a hefty annual fee to get more space.""

It appears that you can't use device when it is transferring files or when the recorder is being accessed by the remote app. Also, please keep in mind that using Wi-Fi eats AA batteries like crazy. After less than a half hour of use, my fresh AAs were already down 1/3 in power.

You can copy files between the device and the iDevice but only in the app. And the transfer is excruciatingly slow even for small WAV files. Speaking of which, iPads and iPhones can't deal with a WAV file. And the only way to play the downloaded WAV file is with the app. Very limiting.

Furthermore there is a PC/Mac download application, but it only works through Wi-Fi. Like the iPad and iPhone app you have to join the dedicated DR-22WL's network from the computer. Like with your iDevice, you are cut off from the Internet who you do this. If your PC or Mac has no wireless capability, then there is no way to access the device through the application. Bluetooth would have gotten around this, but it isn't supported in the DR-22WL. Fortunately, the device can do USB transfers to and from PCs and Macs, so you are not completely dead in the water with your desktop machine.

Lastly, there are some glitches in the DR-22WL firmware--even with the current version. For example, during testing the device the device completely locked up. None of the buttons would do anything. It was necessary to power cycle the device. Speaking of which--on more than one occasion the power button refused to turn the device on. It took several attempts of holding the button for a variety of different times to get the DR-22WL to finally boot. Talk about frustrating!

It seems that TASCAM'S DR-22WL Portable Studio Recorder really isn't quite ready for prime time. Additionally, despite it's ""studio"" moniker. the device's limitations may keep it from finding s home in the pro and semi-pro markets.",0
394,"almost no padding. Well made, but the padding is really really thin. The pockets and the handles are great. The straps are also on the flimsy side. I would not recommend for carrying a guitar around. Maybe to store in a closet, but then not sure you'd need all those pockets.",0
395,"I originally went 5 stars, but after a few short months of minimal use, they are too noisy to use anymore. I can't recommend these, and advise to stay away from them. The following is my original review, so you can better understand my disappointment:
Very high quality and mine came with a handy little velcro tie. That makes me think I should look in to maybe using this type of tie for all of my cables. No noise and I like the black and white tips, because it makes this cable stand out. Great when you have cables all over the place.",0
396,"As magnificent as this product is receiving support or having your product authorized again when you upgrade your studio's computer or operating system is non existent. The only way you can receive any kind of help is through a third party yahoo group that you have to join or some random music bulletin board that's so obscure I can't even remember the name of it. There is no support forum on the company website at all in 2011 the time of this review. If you email them for help you will never get a response, PERIOD! You have to call them long distance and leave a message and sometime within the next 2 weeks they either call back or blow you off. I've had my software in a commercial studio down as long as 6 weeks with several voice mails left on the support line (no one has ever answered).

I've asked the owner a man named Eric Persing who is nothing short of a complete genius at NAMM and in the Yahoo group publicly (as many others have) about the support and the technologies they are using. The people around him become outright hostile at the inquiry this online, ask him at NAMM face to face and boy watch out! It's like having a lawn gnome threaten you with a whooping. It's the Emperor's new clothes I've never seen anything like it. A software company without support in this day and age on the company website? They're a software company!

Spectrasonics Makes some of the most cutting edge products in the industry but without proper technical support how can the software with any longevity be of any use? I hold a BSc CIS and have 20 years experience in information systems pertaining to digital media, Multi Media and am both Logic and Pro Tools certified. I've never seen anything like it. If your name isn't Quincy Jones or Baby Face Edmonds you're wasting your money, these people could care less about you.

I want this review to be completely honest and is respect to spectrasonics defense they have done some really nice things for their customers. They have taken their $500 sample library and offered it to customers for $100. My opinion is that at the price they weren't selling a lot of them and the sounds should have been included in the software at purchase but still that's a very nice thing to do. They have also given upgrades for RMX for free for several years. One so significant it should have been a paid upgrade. Their Trilogy Bass emulator software is nothing short of genius and their Omnisphere Synth blows everything out of the water in the industry hands down.

But again I say what good is it if you can't receive tech support for software you've paid for if it doesn't work?

Bottom line as a studio owner RMX has cost me money in canceled sessions because they refuse to answer email and won't return phone calls if any for weeks. What are you supposed to tell a video game company or a movie studio when you can't make your deadline? Uhhh we're waiting for spectrasonics to authorize our software?

I say it again the Emperor's new clothes, it's ludicrous. I cannot in good conscious recommend Spectrasonics software to anyone.",0

I'm coming from John Pearse strings and those have much more shimmer and definition. The Elixirs sound tight and make any guitar sound either laminated, or more laminated. On a Taylor 214 these sound about the same as a 3-4 day old John Pearse 8020 set.",0

413,"In the world of drum cases, I guess you get what you pay for. These cases work just fine for the small rack toms and even the snare. Where you run into trouble is in putting your bass drum or larger toms into their cases. The foam inside of these cases is not stitched inside to maintain their position between the liner and the outside of the case, so within the first two times of packing and unpacking the bass drum and larger rack toms, the foam rolled over on it self and it becomes a major chore to try and load my larger toms and bass drum back into their bags. There is no way outside of cutting the inside liner to get to the foam and try to make it lay flat again; your frustration will be increased as you try and get your leg spurs and rack tom mount on the base drum stuffed into the case.
Again, I guess you get what you pay for, but I would recommend you save your money a little longer and either purchase hard cases or buy a better quality bag from another manufacturer.",0

422,"This defective keyboard was returned for a refund because the high and low octave piano tones are flat and distorted. Made in China.

We are delighted with the replacement Kawai ES110 Portable Digital Piano that is Much better than the Roland or Yamaha models. I wish I had bought the Kawai in the first place. For a little more money, you get a lot better piano, especially with regards to authentic sound and it plays like a real piano because it utilizes real weighted keys, not emulators, like on the Yamaha and Roland comparable models.

The Kawai has a Zen design, but would be improved with better speakers. Delighted to find the student is much more interested in practicing with this upgrade Kawai after being disappointed with the Yamaha.
The middle of the keyboard is nice with even tones and responsive keys, although the some of the keys had a significant difference in pressure response that causes inconsistent tone levels, even when the same pressure and attack are applied to the keys.

The high end sounds like Schroder's toy piano from the Charlie Brown series - painted on black keys with a cheap plinking sound with virtually no tone on the highest seven keys - just a percussive metallic plinking noise.

The bass end has a horrible flat tone with a strong digitally distorted vibrato (tone vibration) noise.  It has a cacaphonic grating sound - nothing like a natural piano. The bass notes on the bottom octave sound like extended flatulence.

I tested this with headphones and piped through JBL studio monitors, and the same problem occurred, so it was not a problem with the speakers built into the piano.

The keyboard came out of a box that smelled like plastic chemical fumes, and had to be opened on the carport and aired out prior to bringing it in the house.

I am so grateful for the Amazon return policy that allowed me to give this back to the driver that delivered it for a free return and full refund at Amazon.

Other marketplace vendors, other than Amazon, have a hit-or-miss return policy and responsiveness for returns and refunds, so you are best protected from factory seconds or defects if you buy from Amazon directly.

Now I am on to try the Roland or Korg models to see is they have better sound emulation engineering with their ""weighted key"" digital pianos...",0

425,"The only good thing I can say about this tremolo arm is that it arrived very quickly. In my personal opinion, you should NOT have to file down your equipment on your guitar to get a licensed product to fit on something it was designed for. That being said, this is exactly what you have to do for this to even get it to fit... I have a FR 1000 Series bridge and I had filed my bridge plate hole (going off what the other reviewers said) to absolutely no avail even after I got the product to fit. The bottom of the tremolo assembly is flawed since it comes with a nut you have to screw on by hand rather than the screw-in arm that has a hex nut on the bottom in which you can tighten very easily. Even once I got the assembly to fit, the housing was still not secured properly probably due to the nut on the bottom being extremely difficult to tighten. I think the concept is a good idea, but very poorly executed on Floyd Rose's part considering you have to modify your existing bridge to even get the part to fit.",0

I know there are a ton of ways to decrease latency on the computer but the fact is that I was running the mbox without problem.  Just to make sure I hooked it up to my desktop i7 2600k to see if that made a difference and it did not.

Don't really care about the remote to much because I don't plan on using it anyway.  I did get the blue tooth to work with my iPad. I first just plug in my iPad into one of the inputs and turn up the volume. I was disappointed on how low the volume was. For a unit thats supposed to have 700watts, can't be no more than 100watts at most, unless I got a faulty unit. Anyway I have a peavey mixer and I connected that into the unit and plugged my iPad into the mixer and the sound was much better and more volume, with no distortion. The unit does sound good for vocals and acoustic guitar only. Anyway only time will tell, I'm going to use it at a small venue in a few weeks, I also have a Mackie SRM350 which I'll bring with me and used the two units together and see how it works.  All in all for a cheap powered speaker for under $150 its ok.

Updating my Review . Giving one more star. Did more product testing, Bluetooth connected as soon as I turned the unit on, found my iPad and connected, didn't have to pair it again. Tested the USB port, I used a Flash drive, put about 100 mp3 on it and plugged it into the unit. Worked great! Turn the volume up, no distortion. The volume level was good, For small venue's of 100 people or less this should work fine. I had speaker stands from another PA system I had and the PYLE PRO fit perfectly. I'll be using this unit at an event I have in a few weeks. I'll be updating my review again to let everyone know how the unit sounded at the event.

Here's my final review on the unit. I lowered to 2 stars. Went to use the unit this morning plugged in the stereo cable to do a final test before my gig. Everything sounded good, when I unplugged the stereo cables the ground piece on the right channel came out. I't possible this could be just a defective unit. Any way I'm returning it.",0

443,"Well, I have mixed feelings. That's why I gave a 2 stars review after re-testing it.
I bought this mic because I wanted to record me playing a brass instrument as part of my training. Since I'm a beginner I did not wanted to invest more than $150 or even $200 in a professional mic. So I checked  extensively on the web and this one came out handy. You can see on the picture it shows a DSLR camera. So I plugged it in my Nikon D-800 and for my surprise there was no sound at all. I realize I needed to connect the 3.5 adaptor (used for iPhones) and that's the only way to record. The problem is the sound is mono. Well, maybe not such a big deal since many other more expensive ones are also mono and I still don't know if I can compensate during the editing.
The only similar one (around same price) in stereo has a short cable so no use to record closer to my instrument.
I tested it on my iPhone and it worked just fine and stereo. Maybe for interviews it works very well. All the three adaptors work fine on th iPhone.
I'm not still sure if I will return it. I have to record more videos with my camera playing my instrument and see the results.
For the money it is a good mic with two adaptors and a small purse. It comes with an USB card which I have no idea how to use it.
I accessed the website. It is very poor. I tried to click on the vip area but nothing happened. No way to contact anyone on that website so I'm not sure what it is doing there. I understand they sell mics and not websites but....

Then there's the frets: the first two buzz on all the strings, and the first fret even sounds a minor third above the open string, instead of a minor second. If I stay above the third fret with barre chords, I can make it work, but that's obviously not what I had in mind when I bought it.

Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.

The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.

We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.

Having luck with the EHX/Sovtek 12AX7LPS and its lower gain rebranded 5751, I was hoping the 12AY7 would prove to perform equally as well.

I should probably add that the last two EHX/Sovtek 5751's that I've bought in the last few years also developed noise. None of the ones from years ago did this. So when this 12AY7 developed the exact same hum, it was not entirely suprising.

I don't know if it's an issue with the manufacturing, but I've heard that could likely be the case. However, this is the third EHX/Sovtek tube I've had make noise in my Deluxe Reverb. I thought it may be an issue with the amp itself, but 12AX7's and 12AT7's don't have the same problems, including the EHX 12AX7. I put a EHX 12AT7 in the phase inverter slot of this amp at the same time, and it's fine.

So it seems that even if you pay multiple times more for a NOS or UOS 12AY7 that it would be worth it. If I'd have gotten a year and a half's use from this tube, I'd say it's worth it. But the hum makes it a deal breaker.",0

472,"I own and play several acoustic-electric guitars and have two small amps in the house. Wanting to 'unteather' myself from the cables so as to be able to move around more freely, I ordered this JW-01 set. The only thing it did as advertised was to charge!
Pairing failed with each guitar and both amplifiers. The only sound produced was an annoying buzz from the amps - signalling that something was wrong. In NO instance, did the JW-01 successfully transmit the signal from the guitar to the amplifier.
I have emailed both the seller and the manufacturer (in China) and have not received any response. For the price, the JW-01 seemed like a very good deal... too good to be true, as it turns out.",0
473,"""These are the best vintage straps you can buy for the price and they look cool. Fender also makes a better quality vintage strap with a leather backing instead of felt. After using both for years, I kind of lean towards these because they are not so bulky, and look a little more vintage authentic with the felt backing. I like the way the strap fits in the strap button better as well. They are also cheaper, which is a plus. I would use the thicker vintage straps if the guitar you are using is a particularly heavy one, say over eight pounds, as the shoulder pad will give you better support.""

That was my old review. I have purchased, in the past, four of these straps and they were all fine. I just received a new one that has a made in China tag sewed onto the felt and it is garbage. I suggest if you get one of these Chinese made straps and it is made incorrectly, send it back. There is no reason to have to suffer such incompetence. I will include that your guitar will eventually fall off of one of these badly made Chinese straps. Use at your own risk. The holes at the top of the strap on the shoulder pad where the straps slide through are also cut wrong and too big. I would also like to ask the question of why these straps have become about three or four dollars more and they are being made in China. The only explanation I can come up with is greed. So not only are Americans losing their jobs, Americans who buy these badly made Chinese straps are also being charged more. Here is the letter I sent to the seller and also Fender:

""Why is everything made in China a disaster? I have purchased, thru Amazon, four of these straps and everyone has been fine. I believe they used to be made in either Canada or the USA [The leather was stamped Made in USA]. This is the first one where the ""made in"" tag is attached, which I would have to cut off because it is annoying. If you look at the picture on the Amazon website, you will see that the smaller strap has four adjustment holes. This one has one whole, so I cannot adjust the strap properly and the whole is right on the end so the strap doesn't go through the buckle properly. Further, the felt on one end feels like it has glue on it or something. Felt is supposed to be soft. This feels like it was sprayed with glue because the felt is hard and rough. Regardless of these issues, the strap button holes are way too small. They aren't even close to the proper size so that the strap ends flares way out, trying to hold on with the slit, and the strap is not secure. The strap button is being held onto with the slit of the leather. The strap will detach if the strap is left like this. I have included a picture showing you the ends of two of my straps to the right, and the ends of the new strap with the tag still attached on the left [I attached a photo showing both ends of two old straps and both ends of the new strap. The whole size is completely different. The whole size on the new Chinese strap is so ridiculously small that it shows the level of incompetence and horrible quality control on Fender's part.].
In order for me to correct these, I would have to go to my local shoe repair place, and the minimum cost of repair will be the cost of the strap. Why does everything made in China come complete with some problem or issue? It is extremely frustrating having to deal with this kind of incompetence for no reason. Even if they were made incorrectly, Fender has to be responsible for quality control. It doesn't take a genius to see the whole is the wrong size. I could see it the moment I pulled it out of the package. This is maddening. Mistakes are made, people are human. I can accept that. But this is flagrant. There is no excuse on Fenders part and this can't be the first time this issue has come to your attention, which is perhaps why you don't have anymore of these. It is a waste of my time to have to take pictures and type emails and all the rest for an eleven dollar strap. How do you want me to proceed?""",0
474,"I hate the jumbo frets.  The neck warped pretty bad within 2 months and couldn't play the first fret at all.  Pickups are great though, moved them to a different guitar.  I like the weight of the body so will either get a new neck or get some new frets put in.  The nut is filed down too low also which makes the first fret issue even worse.  I don't like the vintage bridge either would prefer a different one.  Not much EM shielding on the pickguard compared with other prewired pickguards that you can buy.",0

476,"We have a very high expectations on this one reading all the review on this product.  Based on the customer feedback, seems like the only issue here is the plastic casing but the overall sound is compared to Boss CS3.  Anyway, my husband was so excited to try this.  He was expecting that his bass sound will be more clearer and will sustain the sound longer.  BUT when we tried, the sound is awful.  Sounded mute. Tried a lot of combinations on the mix but no success.  I am thinking to give 1 star but since the price is very good, Iam giving 2 stars instead.  I think the only excuse to have a cheaper pedal is the material but at least the sound should be good.",0
477,"Hardware installation is as expected.  A little difficult but manageable.
Software installation is a mess, poorly documented, and poorly written.
Fishman has you driving from SF to LA via China.
They tell you to install everything, but only the Fishman software install is essential.
If you setup the hardware as described and plug the wireless USB into a usb port,
the pickup will work with Reason or other popular midi diven software.
The software comes with Triple Play (Fishman), SampleTank, Komplete, Notion, and Studio One.
All of these programs were written by folks with very little knowledge of how to write a user interface.
The screens are generally sloppy, not intuitive, and some (like SampleTank) do not work at all (for me).
This is a product where Fishman tells you it is great and hopes you believe it!
I think the product is heading in the right direction, but has a long way to go.
I own a Roland GR-55.  The GR-55 has much less latency and is much more mature and intuitive.
I bought the Fishman TriplePlay because the tracking/latency is suppose to be better.
Supposedly, you can bend strings with the TriplePlay and it will track (not!).
Latency is worse than the GR-55 and bending does not work at all.
I will keep the TriplePlay as my buddies like to play with it as a novelty
and maybe someday, Fishman will fix it's shortcomings (a tall order).
Wait a few years and the software may improve.....",0

480,returning immediately. misinformed.,0
481,"As the title implies-- please do not buy this product. If you are looking for a good, easily usable midi wind controller, look elsewhere. The first fault I will find with the product is the capacitance controlled buttons-- the lack of button movement will almost immediately feel uncomfortable to players of real instruments. The feel is all wrong. Second, the latency of the unit/software combination is unsettling, and does not seem to be solvable with software settings. Third, the software itself, a product of Garritan, has not been updated since 2009, and does not like to play well with Windows 7. The lack of a standard MIDI out means that it can't be used with stand-alone midi gear. And finally, I have issue with the various fingering patterns. While Saxophone, Oboe, and Flute fingerings are to be expected, as is an EWI specific fingering. The first problem with the fingerings is the EVI fingering, supposedly designed for brass players. Unfortunately, no brass player in the world would recognize this as anything approaching a brass fingering. Without launching into an explanation of standard brass fingerings, these fingerings involve six fingers, not three, and bear no resemblance to say, the fingerings of tubas, trumpets, French horns, euphoniums, or any other valved brass instrument. Finally, a fingering which to me would seem to be a no-brainer, that of a simple recorder, is simply absent. Further, the placement of the two base plate, on the underside of the instrument, are located 1) on the octave rollers, and 2) between the pitch bend buttons. This was a poor choice on the part of Akai, and they know it, according to their customer service technicians. I would only recommend this instrument if you wanted to give it to someone you didn't like, as an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Oh, and by the way, it generally tends to be about a $200 - $300 exercise in frustration and disappointment. CAVEAT EMPTOR  Oh, just for the sake of it, if you're interested in a good, if funky looking wind controller, I might recommend the old CASIO Digital Horn-- be aware, it has a known issue of squealing, but that is relatively easily solved, and I think you'll find it much less irritating than the Akai EWI.",0

Maybe it is secretly just a 3 way switch. Those also have 8 connector feet too sometimes. Tried that. Heck no. It is a gosh darned mystery how to use this thing. After some random experimentation I got the neck and bridge pickups to turn on. I guess that is good enough. Who needs 5 working switch positions anyway?

498,"Overall great concept, I really like the ergonomics of this pedal. The mix feature is also a nice feature that you don't find on too many compressors. The problem is that there is a faint but audible background distortion that I am not able to eliminate from the signal. I made sure that it was not caused by other equipment by just plugging it in straight into my board. I did the same with my other compressor at exact same gain, and the distortion want away. I can somehow mitigate the issue by keeping the guitar volume slightly turned down and also keeping the compressor level down, but I should not have to do that. It is disappointing, since I like everything else about it. Another thing is that how does one get Joyo pedals repaired? I sent email to them while back but no response so far.",0

Perhaps if you are 4-5' tall and weigh 80-100 lbs, this would be ok...
I normally wear my bass fairly high but this was still too short.

The neoprene shoulder portion is ok...stretches a little bit and seems like it would be comfortable.

The bottom half of the strap is el cheapo nylon and the end pieces are typical of a $5 strap.

Overall, I don't care for this strap even if it was long enough to use. The neoprene section is ok but the rest is really pretty cheapo in it's construction. I realize it's only a $23 strap...but I don't think it's a good value at that price point.

I wrote them a polite e-mail describing the problem two weeks ago, and I'm still waiting for a reply. I can't buy a replacement leg anywhere, so my 2nd tier isn't worth jack squat.

UPDATE: Jan 15, 2016  I have been unhappy with this tuner for a while now.  It worked very well when it was new, but it wasn't long before it became slow to respond.  Sometimes I have to pluck the string 5-6 times and still no response from the tuner.  The first time its performance started to lag, I put in a new battery and it seemed to improve a bit.  This time a new battery didn't help.  My reliable old Snark SN-2, even though it's a few years older, is still going strong, and its batteries last far longer.

508,"If I could give these tuners ZERO stars I would. These deserve a minus rating category. Poor workmanship, binding and a 12:1 ratio render these basically unusable to anyone seeking to have their guitar play in tune.

Tune a string which is 2 cents flat (on a Peterson strobe) and move the tuning key the slightest and now you have 2 cents sharp.just starting to put pressure on the key and you can see it change pitch. This is most likely due to the crummy machine work on the gears which cause them to bind. Honestly, these are the absolute worst tuners I have EVER used.

Contacting Sperzel gets a send them back to be repaired. They are new! When asking about buying another set, I asked if they were as bad, could I send them back for a refund. Their reply,""No!"" They stated I could only return them for replacement or repair as well.

A 12:1 ratio, in my opinion, isn't a good ratio. The replacement tuners I ordered from Hipshot are 18:1, meaning you can fine tune your guitar.

Cold solder joints all over the place. You could see where the solder was not adhering to the leads of the transformer and the connectors. Even worse one of the solder pads for one of the transformer leads was broken from the pc board trace leading to it, a nearly invisible defect that was hard to find. After fixing that I did an A/B test to listen to how transparent it wounded.

You will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units.  This is true for either one of the models.

560,didnt work had to return it,0
561,"Let me start by saying there are some good things about this pedal.
For one, the crybaby effect is pretty good.
The fact that you can change the order of the effects in the software is nice.
Some of the effects are cool.
The software is easy to figure out, and connecting to the unit is fast.
Switching patches has nearly no noticeable lag.

Then there are the things I really hated.

I hated the expression pedal.
There is no visual indication of the state of the expression pedal. Is it on? Is it off?

The expression pedal, on most patches by default, operates as both volume and expression. This means that if you want to use the expression pedal for something like the crybaby, your only option is full volume - because you first have to push the expression pedal all of the way down in order to activate the crybaby.
Certainly you can remove the volume pedal from the patches - but then you probably want an external volume pedal - which kind of defeats the purpose of a multi-effects unit in my humble opinion.

Also, it's way too easy to accidently turn the expression pedal on and off. If you're not very careful, every time you press it forward, it switches state.

I hated the user navigation.
I purchased the optional FS3X to use with this, and honestly it's kind of a joke. While it makes it slightly easier to use the looper, the FS3X operations are by-and-large redundant to what you can do with the existing buttons. Beyond using the extension for the looper operations, you can put it into ""FS3X"" mode - which basically just turns two of those switches into 'up' and 'down' buttons - which are accessible from the main unit regardless of which 'mode' you put that into.

Furthermore, when you put the FS3X into FS3X mode, with the current firmware - if you accidently activate the looper by pressing the looper switch JUST ONCE, it goes into record mode and will then start playing the loop - and depending on the mode the main unit is in - there's no way to stop it from looping.

There's no way to switch between the 3 modes without getting down onto the floor, and navigating through the menu by hand.

There are basically 3 modes this can do, arguably the most useful is 'stomp box' mode which allows you to turn 3 different effects on or off within the patch. You can leave the unit in 'stomp box' mode, then hit the 2 right pedals simultaneously to switch to ""patch mode"" - however it's design makes it quite difficult to do this, and it's difficult to not accidently activate the looper when doing this. When you're not in stompbox mode, there is no way to switch to stompbox mode using any combination of foot switches.

I hated the echo effects.
To my ear, the echo effects on this unit sounded fake, harsh, and distorted. I tried several of the 'stomp boxes' and settings, and just never could make it sound real enough for my tastes. This is completely subjective, of course. You may like them.",0
562,"i ordered this in March 2016, it broke 11 months later :l. fuse is intact- not cool line 6",0
563,"I have tried several shoulder rests, including the Kun, and have not been able to use any of them, but upon seeing the large curve of the Bon Style shoulder rest, I imagined that it would work for me.  However, I was uncomfortable, feeling pain in my shoulder, and I had to go back to playing the violin without a shoulder rest.  I would add that this shoulder rest should never slip off of the violin since the fit is very, very tight - in fact I wondered if I might break the shoulder rest or violin in taking the rest on or off.  I would recommend this shoulder rest over others, however, only if you have used shoulder a rest before, and you  are comfortable playing with a shoulder rest.",0
564,"Not fully MIDI compatible.  I burned an entire day writing some python code to handle incoming MIDI data on a linux box and I was getting erratic behavior.  I'd see a Note On on channel 5, then the note off coming in on channel 0.  The next note was Channel 0 On, and Channel 0 off.  Tried my other keyboard and set to Channel 8.  I got a Note On coming in on channel 8, but the Note Off coming back in on Channel 1.  Put in an old USB adapter of mine (midisport 2x2) and suddenly no problems.

Can't take credit for the explanation, but the one I found on a blog comment was ""[it's] sticking a 0x90 in front of every message of 2 bytes.""

The 40 is significantly louder, both with vocals and with electric guitar.  I am returning the 90 and exchanging it for another in the hopes I got a defective model.  I will update this review when the replacement 90 comes in.  Crossing my fingers!

584,"The product description says ""Spandex Material"" but you should know this is not made of what I would call ""typical"" Spandex used for clothing that would be of much higher weight/thread-count and as another reviewer stated, if it were to get snagged on anything it appears it will likely leave a hole.  In fact, if you wore clothing made out of this in public you'd likely get arrested!  You can easily see right through the material.  I'd say either buy a cheap bath towel at 1/4 the price or look for a vinyl cover if you can find one.

The only advantages I see are 1) that it has adjustable (via a pull string) elastic around the edges to keep it in place; and 2) it comes with an attached built in pouch to stuff the entire cover back into if you were to travel with your keyboard; however, given the pouch is all of 5"" x 6"" that should tell you how thin the actual cover's material is (another reviewer said it was 3""x3""x4"" but it's a bit larger than that and only expands due to the Spandex, otherwise it's flat).",0

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the foam turned GREEN after four months in my apartment. It's environmentally controlled, so there hasn't been an excess of humidity beyond what's normal for living quarters or anything. The blue panels just turned green - and now they look disgusting.

For example: There is a sooth lowering of the volume untill you at aroud 75 percent of the angle on the pedal (so at the range of movement youve used %75) the signal just cuts out...this has to do with the optical sensor...i was told it could be a bad sensor but after replacing it i had the same issue. The distortion is at best Decent for a guitar, but useless for a bass (i used it as a boost) the wah was nothing compared to any mainstream wah (Dunlop) or for that matter even an auto wah (Boss/DigiTech)...

The manual for Pedal was one page few lines and said easy set up and the fact this is a Universal. I sent an email to see what is going on . It seemed they sent me a Pedal that was returned may be by BIG FOOT. Sure $10 less than anyone else is the way to go and more than likely not tested.  I called support the guy keep talking what key board I used. My answer to him, why key board  why you  bringing key board. WHY? The support did not know Axon. Some of may not know but a support must know it. AXON is a Midi controller for guitar synthesizer which allow guitar player through 13 pin cable get different tone such as piano whole lot. It is not that easy think before putting any money in this field. Any way the support in seetwarer is a joke. This Pedal is made to be broken If I go to car BODY SHOP and say I have a broken Fender Ultra  I expect the guy ask what company make this car or Fender but I am talking about Fender guitar ultra w/ebony fret board. Most car do have Fender. that is why, SUPPORT in a music franchise should know Pedals are not only for Key Boards and then act like I am an idiot.

623,"These strings are not at all balanced. The tension on the nylon (E and B) strings is relatively low (9.13lbs and 7.24lbs) whereas the tension on the wound (G and D) stings is quite high (14.37lbs and 14.87lbs). Consequently, the volume and the quality of tone is very different between the set of nylon strings and the set of wound strings. If you are only going to play simple chords, this may be OK, but if you play any riffs that transition between the nylon and wound strings, it almost sounds as if you are switching to a different instrument in the middle. Nearly 2x tension difference between the B string and the G string makes it difficult to control volume and dynamics for finger style playing.

I found this A-T mic model number on a blog where someone said it was a good mic and I decided to purchase it. First off, it's WAY overpriced. I think its worth about $160-180 dollars max. Its an extremely flat response mic, not dynamic at all. I'm sure it would work well for some type of plays or film works where a depressing, flat sound is best. I think they made it that way to reduce background noise, but regardless this mic does not sound great at all. It is accurate though, I'll give it that. But its just a boring mic.

634,"The product here is made of two things: the bottle/dispenser and the substance inside. The substance worked pretty well. The bottle was horrendous. It's basically a dense cotton top, and it's designed to work such that you ""brush"" the conditioner onto your fingerboard. Same idea as a felt-tip marker or pen. Problem is that the cotton is too dense, so the stuff doesn't flow through it. Until it does.

The first time I went to use it, I was getting zero product through the cotton top. I had no time to wait so I just finished the setup I was doing without using it. No worries, and I stored it upside down so the product could saturate the cotton part and be ready for next time.

Second time I went to use it, same problem. Storing it upside down did nothing at all. So I squeezed it a little. Didn't work. Squeezed a little harder. Didn't work. Squeezed pretty hard, still no conditioner coming out. Squeezed the life out of it, got a few drops to come out. It was enough to do the fingerboard I was working on, so that was that. I put it away (again upside down), hoping that I'd finally ""broken the seal"" so to speak.

Third time I went to use it, exact same problem. Started squeezing it again, as I did the last time. Apparently squeezed too hard, because the top popped off, splattering oil all over my guitar, my repair station, my tools, my repair mat, and my carpet. Left stains on my wall which have not come up. Had to replace my repair mat. Also threw out my rug, because who knows what would happen to my cats if they were to ingest the stuff. Spent at LEAST two hours getting it off the guitar (had to disassemble in the end), off my tools, and off my wall and floor. Will have to reprime and repaint the wall.

Zero audio into either my iPad or iPhone 6. Tried all switches in all directions, mic plugged into it, unplugged from it, etc. Further, it didn't even register ""on"" with a known good 9V battery from my other hacked SmartRig. I think this is just bad parts and shady QC from the manufacturer. Hate to say that, because I've used other Saramonic gear and they've all bee great.

The camera hack: if you're looking for a phantom-powered XLR input for your DSLR camera (not for your i-device)... this isn't it. However, you can very easily modify this great pre-amp to plug into your 3.5mm camera mic input jack. Yes you will void any kind of warranty, but there don't seem to be any suitable (read: under $100) gizmos that will supply phantom power to your mic and allow you to plug that mic into your camera. I have a Tascam DR-60 MkII which will accomplish this task, but I wanted something small and light (tiny, really) that wouldn't be too cumbersome on my camera's shoulder rig. And for $30, you really can't go wrong.

There is a great YouTube video DIY for this mod: a little cutting, a little soldering... Et voila! You now have an excellent microphone pre-amp that also supplies phantom power to your mic, and you can plug it directly into your camera! You will also need a male-to-male 3.5mm jumper cable, since the Saramonic SmartRig headphone jack is now the output to the camera.",0

646,"This device is very well made, solid as steel and sexy looking. However, it claims to making tuning drums quick and convenient, and with that I'm at a loss. I play a large drum kit with mountable tom toms and bought this so that I could tune on the fly, perhaps just before a gig; from what I read, that's what it seemed to be for. The problem is the drum must lie flat so that you can rest this device on the batter surface. Thus, you must dismount each drum for tuning.

I tried it on a snare drum for which I'd just purchased a new head. I finger tightened each lug, as instructed, and then tightened one with a key just a couple spins. Oddly, the device registered 68 for that lug, and all the others. As I'd tighten one, the others would show the same tension. I'm not saying the device is defective, I just didn't understand how to make it work for me, and the very brief instruction paper was of very little value (to me).

Perhaps a seasoned pro could find value in this, or someone playing always level drums, like timpani's. I am much better off just tuning by ear, lug by lug, with all drums mounted and ready to play. So again, nothing against Drumdial or this tuner, but I do challenge their claim of 'quick' tuning, and also they really should have more detailed instructions.",0

REVISED FEB 15 2016

ALTHOUGH THIS GUITAR STILL SOUNDS GOOD IT'S PROVING TO BE A REAL PAIN IN THE BACKSIDE!
THE FRETS ARE NOT SANDED DOWN... in fact they are quite sharp along to edges. They are literally cutting up the skin on my fingers. I thought I had developed some kind of weird skin rash until later I realized that it was the frets scraping against my skin. Horrible quality control... made in china!

ALSO THE PICKUP JACK HAS BECOME LOOSE causing buzz and break up....AND BECAUSE OF THE POOR DESIGN YOU CANNOT ACCESS THE NUT . YOU HAVE TO GO IN THROUGH THE TINY SOUND HOLE BUT It is impossible  to reach to nut of the jack. If someone can recommend  a special tool for this please do.

I could bring this to a guitar tech to fix no doubt but I'm sure it will cost $200.

661,"After reading the reviews, I was hopeful that this interface would solve my Windows 8.1 problems.  Since the 8.1 upgrade, I can no longer connect USB to USB from my keyboard controllers to my computer.  The invalid descriptor issue was not present in XP, and I had no problems until a purchased a new laptop with 8.1.  Since the only work-around seems to utilize an external interface I first tried one of the cheap generic ones.  It worked; however, garbles the controller settings, and returns a full velocity E4 when pressing the sustain pedal.  I noticed another reviewer reporting the same issue, so sent it back.  When I received this one, I immediatly tried it on my O2, but only regiestered a few notes after a long delay, even though the Ableton Live 9 software showed an input.  Upon trying it on my O2 and Casio keyboard nothing was registered.  I went back to the old generic one, and it worked, but still had the pedal issue.

Needless to say, this issue with Windows 8.1 has become a frustrating problem.  The one  I received is most likely defective; although I'll try the Roland next, and hope it works.",0
662,"I'm wondering if I got a bad one. These things were out of stock for a few months this summer (dangit!) but came back in a couple of weeks before Christmas (yesssssss) so I eagerly ordered one.

I've seen YT videos where the SawTooth / GoDPS guys say they set them up professionally before they're shipped, and they certainly do look and sound fantastic in those videos. This was particularly interesting to me as sometimes I just don't want the hassle of doing a setup on a new purchase (my G&L needed a setup, as did my Godin, for example), and I thought it was especially cool that such a cheap guitar came with such love and affection.

Out of the box, the finish was beautiful - '50s-'60s surf green with a yellowed pickguard, no chips or dings in the finish that I noticed, and a clean-enough neck-body joint. The intonation was pretty much spot on. The neck pickup is in more of a normal tele position, not smooshed up against the end of the neck as in the pictures. This would give me more room to install a humbucker ;-)

The negatives:
- the strings were flapping off the neck, perhaps a safety feature that they were slackened off, I thought. Until I tuned it.
- the action was literally (the ""literally"" that means ""actually"", not the literally that means ""figuratively"") half an inch off the neck. Not playable.
- the pickups were way too high
- pickups weak, probably why they were so high
- the bridge saddles move when you bend strings, and they don't always return to their original location - that's tuning instability
- bridge saddle broke the high E string while attempting to tune - it kept slipping, but not at the tuner, somehow

I adjusted the bridge saddle heights to see if MAYBE I could get this thing to work. The action was getting better and playability definitely improved.... but it couldn't go low enough on the G, B, and high E, because the 18th fret is too high.

Saddles moving on their own and frets needing work = ""doesn't work properly"" to me, so I'm submitting a return request. Anything you can work on with basic tools like a screwdriver and an allen key are OK, but high frets means special tools, and that's just not on for a brand new guitar.

I completely understand that this is a cheap guitar (well, when it's not here on Amazon at over $350, that is) and I was more than prepared to put in some time and effort into making it a viable guitar - adjust string height, tweak the truss rod, set the intonation, polish the frets, etc - but I'm not prepared to do things that shouldn't need to be done.

Which brings me to my sad realization: these are entry-level guitars. Many folks try guitars like these as their first intro to electric guitars. If they're going to get instruments like this in the mail they're potentially going to be put off guitars unnecessarily (the action out of the box was simply unplayable), and that's an awful shame.

I work with veterans and I know first hand the healing power of music and it saddens me to think that somebody NEEDING music therapy might be put off by pretty colors and cheap price tags.

Not that GoDPS / SawTooth are the causes of this! I just think that a purchaser should be careful with a cheap guitar, and be prepared to try a few on and not be discouraged with the first one or two.

Unless you're a tinkerer, I'd steer clear of these. If you're wanting alternatives, by all means stay with Amazon thanks to their very generous return policy, but also look into brands like SX, Agile, Hadean, Douglas (from Rondo Music) and, of course, brands like Squier from Fender and Epiphone from Gibson.

I'm disappointed, but glad for the experience. Not sure what to do with my $115 Christmas money now... :-)",0

Original review:

With the equipment I have, a hollow-body electric guitar and a basic small amplifier, this works well.  However my G10 has an annoying quirk that I think is related to the way it stops draining the battery after a period of no sound from the guitar.  Most  of the time when I don't make any noise on the guitar for a minute or so the system will shut down to conserve the battery.  However in recovering the G10 doesn't always come back on at full-output levels.  Walking over to the G10 and pulling the cable out of the jack and reinserting it sems to reboot the system at full output volume... if this sort of thing happened when playing out it would be aggravating.

Aside from that, I like it.",0

The 90` end on BOTH cables have developed a short and the cables now crackle and don't work as theres obviously a break in the wire internally.  Since they are molded ends the cables cannot be repaired, so they are really just cheap disposable cables.",0

675,"The description on this Amazon page says:  ""GHS weighted action is heavier in the low end and lighter in the high end, just like an acoustic piano.""

However going to Yamaha product website we see the difference: ""Yamaha's GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) weighted action has heavier touch in the low end and lighter touch in the high end, just like the hammers inside an acoustic piano.""

These are two very different things, I bought a piano based on online advertising that would sound just like an acoustic piano. This does not at all play like an acoustic piano, however I understand what Yamaha means when they say just like the hammers inside an acoustic piano. This means that they are modeling how the hammer hits, not that it is just like an acoustic piano.

Out of the 15 or so digital and/or physical pianos I've owned, and out of the 100's or so that I've played on, this is the absolute worst piano I have ever used. I am having to SLAM on the keys to produce high velocities. I mean slam with more force used than to pound a nail into a piece of wood with a hammer.

So I went to the website and eventually was led to a site called JS Karaoke, HA! This is supposed to be the support and warranty service department for Emerson products, I got the impression all they wanted was to avoid making good on any warranty, (this model no longer available and multiple proof of purchase requests, etc.)  but I filled out all the proper forms and requests and eventually finally got a Return Authorization, I had to pay for shipping of course and they did finally send me a replacement machine, but it did not work! So when I reported this back to JS Karaoke they told me I was sent a replacement but the warranty doesn't cover replacements.

Note that as of this date, 22% of reviewers are giving this device 3 stars or less.

I was recently forced to use one of these [briefly, thanks the gods], while travelling when I was separated from my usual kit. Even compared to comparably priced midi keyboards, this item is plasticky, and had, in both the units I worked with, very poorly regulated keyboard s(for newbies- on a well regulated midi keyboard, keys from one end to the other require the same pressure /speed to produce the same response. On one unit, less than 3 months old, two of the pads were non-functional though they still lit when pressed. Both units had sloppy usb connections where it was far too easy to pull the cord out by accident.  The unit's faders were short throw, expected I guess at this price point, but this fact combined with an anything but smooth made it seem very unrealistic to try them unrealistic to use them for anything but very coarse adjustments to DAW parameters.

I'm a conservatory trained musician. I use Finale and Logic X, though Im slowly shifting more and more work to Studio One and Notion.  My principal keyboard is a Kawai MP7, and I use a Presonus Faderport 1 and recently a Faderport 8 (they have faders to die for), though I still have my Novation 25SL MKII that I use as needed (anywhere outside the studio with an iPad for instance). Even used, these now run twice what's being charged for the 25 key version of the Launchkey. They're worth it.

Novations got some ""OK"" equipment these days at their upper end, especially when it comes to pad based units, where they and Akai have the market pretty much buttoned up, but the lower grade stuff is just not up to snuff, and this is definitely lower grade. Do your research, at these price points the competition is very intense. I've seen these being give away on other sites as part of packages. Novation is a big outfit in the music world, but part of that is a huge advertising budget. That budget must come from somewhere.",0

698,"I've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super Overdrive...Sweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well. I have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. It really does react to your playing style. Unlike other overdrive pedals I've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it ""focus"", there is also a volume and drive knob. The sounds I can get out of the Sweet Baby are some of the best I've ever used and easy to dial in. I own a lot of pedals but lately I keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a EHX-Crying Tone wah pedal, then the Sweet Baby, then a Boss Super Overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... I don't use Distortion pedals.), next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay. The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp. I use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... I play mostly Blues and Classic Rock. The Sweet Baby is well made and I don't see it failing me anytime soon. You can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this ""clone"" overdrive tone blender...

Update: this pedal has since been returned. It went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. The connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...I have since put my Boss Super Overdrive back in the chain...while I truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for.",0
699,"I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go ""flat"" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.",0

705,"I bought this 5 months ago and I've been recording with it banging my head against a wall trying to figure out what to do about the flat/no depth to the sound.  The recording on this is a bit weak.  I have to crank it all the way up (with mic) to get decent sound levels (this machine had very low input, even with dynamic mic), I get louder sound volumes with the mixer but the sound is muffled/unclear/no highs or lows.  Acoustic guitars are very muddy, I don't hear the individual strings ring out like I heard with prior TASCAM Portastudio recorders (I've owned 5).

I've had multiple problems with this unit and I am taking it in for repairs.  Hopefully this may fix the weak sound.  I did read a post on a recording site and someone pointed out that you don't see any bad reviews on this model but you do see a lot of used ones for sale.  I've been a solid Tascam Portastudio for 20+ years and I don't think this machine is up to par with past Portastudio models.  It's got quite a large foot print and is a bit heavy, but that seems par with the Portastudio recorders.  I'm very disappointed in this machine and will be replacing it as soon as possible.

UPDATE:
Took it to the Tascam Repair facility and they won't touch it without one hundred thirty nine big ones to look at it because Tascam warranty is only 90 days on labor, movable parts, one year on parts only.  They wouldn't even give me a guesstimate on repairs.

UPDATE #2:
After much haggling with Tascam they have agreed to replace the unit with another one from their factory.  Hopefully, I won't have the same problems with this one.

At about 10 feet they drop off and get static. I keep them in the box and take care of them. I used the 10 dollar durecell batteries and buy them before each gig. This was embarassing. I had a cerimony where the transmitter was no more than 15 feet from the reciver and the pastor doing the wedding was droppin out BAD! Only about 1/2 the cerimony worked. When the mic was used for the Vows the bride had zero reception and everything she said was NOT heard! Its deadly when you have a paid gig and things do not work!

For starters, the A string snapped on me with barely any tension on it. Yes, the A string, not the G that tends to snap in a lot of string sets, but a relatively heavy A.
I got a replacement for that (also an Elixir, as I prefer all strings to stay same-set).

But then I found that they all sound relatively dull and lifeless out of the box. Well, I thought maybe I need to wait for them to settle in, but time really did not help with it. The strings lack a lot of sustain and volume, especially on the bass. Treble is... eh, it's okay at best.

It's most suitable for side-by-side/dual mic placement rather than stereo pairs, especially overheads.  However, there are plenty of other less solid options (like flexible ""v"" bars) for positioning longer mics out there worth consideration.

NOTE- the construction was not as solid as initially stated. The threaded mounting that attaches to the mic stand cracked after falling over once.

754,"My first and probably last Behringer pedal.
I was always curious about Behringer pedals since they always seem to have a split personality .... 50% of people love them -- 50% of people hate them.

Well I needed an Overdrive for my Bass Rig so I thought I would try one of these for studio use.
My bass rig is a Precision P-Bass and Jackson Dave Ellefson Concert Bass into a Hartke LH500 head with 4X10 Hartke cabs.

This pedal was horrible
Even on minimum gain, you get a thin ratty fuzzy distortion ..... NOT a pure overdrive push.
This reminded me of some of the really cheap distortion pedals (like Arion and Dinosaur) they used to make for guitar.
I spent an hour trying to get a good overdrive from this pedal and just gave up .............. I will give it to some kid for free just to get rid of it.

I ended up using an older yellow DOD 250 overdrive pedal ( the old ones do not filter off low end like a Tube Screamer does) ..... and that was 500% better

My search for a much better bass overdrive will continue.

I will also add that the hard plastic case seems durable enough-- but the battery change in really hokey.
Digitech used the same idea many years ago - but they uses metal parts and secure springs so it worked.
But this same design in a plastic pedal looks like a breakage just waiting to happen.

I've played for more than 20 years and I have always used Ernie Ball strings, not anymore.  Quality control matters, guys.",0

774,"D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these ""cheap"" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period.",0
775,"I had high hopes for this microphone, but at the current street price of $109, it's just not worth it. There are a lot of better options out there. Read on for my full review...

I have several microphones for recording podcasts, doing live Google Hangouts, and Skype calls with colleagues that are all over the world. I was really optimistic about the CAD Audio U39 USB condenser microphone, because I'd love to have another full-size mic so I could have one setup at both my home office and my work. Unfortunately, this mic didn't impress me at all.

Upon opening the box, I liked the minimalistic packaging. It almost looked like Amazon's ""frustration free"" packaging, but it was clear this was the manufacturer's standard packaging. It was simple, easy to open, and had minimal waste. Inside, the microphone, USB cable, and tripod were all wrapped separately in plastic.

The microphone itself seems to be made fairly well. The mic is made of metal and has a good weight to it, but the buttons and volume dial are plastic and feel kind of cheap. Overall though, the construction of the microphone is pretty good.

The microphone stand, however, is complete crap. It's lightweight plastic, and felt like it was going to break when I opened it for the first time. I would definitely want a heavier stand - the microphone is pretty heavy and the tripod doesn't feel very stable. Add a pop filter and it would tip over.

The sound quality of the CAD U39 microphone left a lot to be desired. The sound levels were crazy high... even after manually turning the levels down and moving back at least 12"" from the microphone I was still spiking well above acceptable ranges. Compared to several other microphones I own this mic has very high output levels. That requires some adjusting before recording because you can't really fix that in post production.

The sound itself was a little disappointing too. I really love the rich, deep sound my Samson G-Track USB Condenser Microphone gives me, and this CAD U39 was mich higher pitched and was not nearly as welcoming. Maybe it works well for vocals, I don't know, but I didn't like the sound I got out of it.

In the end, there are a LOT of other options in the $100 price range, I could not consider this a serious contender. Between Samson, Audio-Technica and Blue, there are a lot better options out there to consider.",0

780,"First off, SKB is great about warranty claims. If your case blows up, they will send new parts without a hassle. Also, the cases are sturdy, and they pamper your guitars.

Now, to the problem. The handles explode. I don't mean they crack. They shatter instantly, in several pieces, and the guitar hits the ground before you know what's happening.

I have two SKB cases with molded handles. One blew up a few years back, and the other blew up a few days ago.

If you contact them, they send you a new handle. You have to install it. To do that, you have to damage the lining a little.

The obvious question: will the new handles explode like the old ones? SKB needs to confront the issue publicly. I'm afraid to buy new SKB cases.",0

I have have experimented with a variety of tunings  and set up to make it sound... well to give it some life.  It's just Flat and dead.  Maybe if it had some built-in electronics you could probably fudge the sound but as an acoustic guitar it is flat. I don't know how anybody could give this guitar five stars or even four. I'm going to give this guitar away.,0

788,"Meh... this is kind of a tough call. You are buying two things here:

1. You are buying three fret rockers to check your fret height (in very small samples)
2. You are buying a wooden block that has grooved sides to use as a sanding block for frets that are already crowned.

The amount of sand paper and steel wool really isn't worth adding up and comparing to the price. It's next to nothing

I will ask you this. What if you follow the instructions but you really have a low fret instead of a high one?
It really isn't something a pro would ever recommend, but you ""might"" get lucky and fix something with this. It's possible, but fretwork really should be something you take your guitar to a pro for.

And no, I am not a pro. I've just been around guitars long enough to know you could do as much harm as good with this... and its really not worth the cash anyway.",0

It ironically said that it was tested! But it would have taken just one second to anybody that has ever played a guitar to realize what was the problem. Fender should be embarrassed with its quality control.
Also, keep in mind that the neck is much narrower than that of other typical classical guitars (it's similar in width to the necks of steel-string guitars). You may like this or not, but it should be more evident in the description of the guitar.",0

It had LEAKED and CORRODED the end of the battery. So, not only did I not get a NEW product, but had received a RETURNED ITEM! Really? Is this where we're at with Amazon? I'd expect this from ""Joe's Ripoff Emporium"", but to buy a new product and get returned questionable product - TOTALLY. NOT. COOL.

He put a new bridge and locking tuners on it, and bought a boss pedal tuner. It still could not be properly intonated after hours of adjustment. He had a deep emotional attatchment to it because of the person who gave it to him, and we couldn't really ask him to get rid of it. We once spent 3 hours in a studio attempting to tune and adjust this guitar. He ended up using my guitar for the rest of the session. It was a happy day for us when it was stolen.
Before you buy this guitar please consider the possibility that it might have improperly dried neck wood, a badly cut neck pocket and a poorly cut nut.",0
812,"really wanted to love this one. it was $180, and the look is just awesome. but, in studio and on stage, i am pretty disappointed and here is why...

other amazon reviews suggested that it is pretty good about plosives / pops, but it's really not. even in the video demonstration one of the top reviews posted here, you can hear it popping almost immediately.

as for live settings - with any sort of louder rock band - it picks up a lot of the drums, no matter where you're standing. it seems to get excited by the highs of cymbals in a way that it doesn't for just your voice. it's also not super directional, so you really have to eat it on stage.

i also don't recommend it for anyone using any vocal processing (compressor, delay) unless you are using in-ear monitors. this thing feeds back way too easily.

after giving up on it, i went for a completely uncool looking mic - the EV 967 - which has brighter highs, deeper lows, an all around more ""studio"" sound on stage - and seems to pick up my voice and only my voice, even when i'm right next to my drummer.

the Super Deluxe 55 seems to be much better about anti-feedback and side rejection. might be worth the extra money if the style is super important to you. but remember that while you are committing to this look, you are buying a microphone that you NEED to be RIGHT AGAINST to pick up properly, covering a huge chunk of your face in an unflattering way.

PS i kinda hate that this is labeled ""The Elvis Microphone"", but i guess that's what it is.",0

817,"Having a backround in electronics and audio engineering, I understand why Shure (and other manufacturers of similar devices) use a 'companding' circuit to minimize noise and interference.  Like a Dolby or DBX system, the audio is 'compressed' going in, and 'expanded' (supposedly back to its original state) coming back out.  Unfortunately this is not always the case, at least not with my unit, which has begun to exhibit such behavior as to cause me to go back to being hard-wired again. I cannot allow my playing dynamics or style to be compromised by such an anomaly.  I've scoured the internet for any info about this, but to no avail.  Were I able to obtain proper service/tech manuals for this, I would attempt an adjustment.  None seem to exist; just the simplified (and pretty much useless) user manual.",0
818,First and foremost I want to say that I bought this hi hat stand from Guitar Center. I did not buy it from Amazon. But I can say that it was promptly returned the very next day due to its inability to function properly.

Every two pumps of the hi hat pedal that metal piece would fall off and the pedal would start hopping all over the floor. It was a cheap piece of junk.

It can not be used with any acoustic guitar or semi hollow body like an ES 335 or and other guitar (like a Gibson SG) that has a strap button attached to the center of the body near the place where the neck attaches. The strap is just too short. It works fine on a Gibson Les Paul if you are of average stature or play your guitar high up and probably on most guitars with the strap button mounted to the upper base bout like a Fender. If you have a bass guitar I would look for a different strap as well.

The hardware looks nice, it came with the required midi in/out adaptors and the ground-loop spoiler cable. As I looked through the box and manual I realized there is no power supply because this thing derives it's power from the USB hole on your computer. After reading the manual (skinny quick start guide) and looking at the hookup diagrams I realized this hardware would not work for me because I don't have a computer in my keyboard room.

I wanted to love it but it got packed back in the box and returned to Amazon because it won't operate stand-alone without a computer as far as I can tell.

Wasn't bad at first, or maybe I just didn't notice, but the shaking has really been making it difficult to play. It forwards & backwards, as well as side to side. It's mostly the fwd/bwd movement that makes playing difficult. I've tightened every knob and screw I can, but it's useless. I'll be buying a more stable stand, something along the lines of the K&M Omega or something with similar stability. So be aware that the stand may seem mostly solid at first, but it will become wobbly over time. If you play sitting down, it won't be as noticeable and you'll probably be OK with it.",0
839,The microphone works decently but nothing really special I can say about it where I would notice the quality is  better that other less expensive ones.  My over rating is based more upon the shock mount which is of poor design and requires a pair of pliers and maybe a 14 inch monkey wrench to exaggerate the difficulty to tighten the swivel down. Typical of poor Chinese manufacturing which requires bribe paying to pass material through their own inspection.  The pop filter is also  totally worthless and should be eliminated from the package.  When Blue supplies inferior product to their microphone it cheapen the Microphone itself.  As I said the Mic works decently but equal to those costing a hundred less. It's the attachments that lower the value of the overall package. Even the cheap wooden Chinese box  which probably has hazardous chemicals in the stain.  Having worked for the federal Government and traveling as a tourist I noticed that toys that had been recalled from the US because of hazardous material are still being manufactured the same old way but now go through the bribe taking inspection officials and are being sold in the country.  Just because someone claims something is made in the US that is not necessarily true but you can make the claim if it assembled in the US.,0

859,I have a Fender Super Champ XD which it is supposed to fit however it is a super tight fit at best and is a pain to tug all the way onto the amp. You really have to force it on. The biggest  shortcoming however is that the opening for the amp handle is way to large and it's off center so the handle doesn't clear the edge of the opening. This all made me wonder if it's a factory second. I should have just spent the extra for a really good cover. If I were gigging more regularly I'd have returned it. The shipping was fast though.,0

I tried different cables, usb ports and hubs. I turned off automatic power save for usb hubs. Checked settings in bios. I tried another computer but nothing helped.

861,"If I was a hip hop artist, or played other kinds of music that required a lot of sample triggering, then I might feel differently.  But I bought this because I thought it would be a better, more tactile and fun way of playing sampled drum software like my awesome Addictive Drums.  Nope.  as others have mentioned, the pads are not sensitive.  I bought the pad inserts (the kind that look like electrical tape without the sticky), and all they did was make it easier to reach full velocity.  Hits are typically either full velocity or very low.  It's very difficult to achieve anything in the middle.  I guess I'll try the ""corx"" inserts next, although I won't be holding my breath for much more improvement.  It usually annoys me when someone reviews something in an application it was not intended for.  But I'll bet there are a lot of people like me who are looking at an Akai MIDI player to trigger multi-layered drum samples.  Don't do it.",0

The app is cool how you can profile devices and it trains the strings and all but honestly I find myself just flipping up a clipped on tuner every time now, it's way faster. I sometimes the Roadie as a spin up device when changing strings but for the price that functionality can be had way cheaper. I'd pass until they make this a less clumsy experience.",0
867,"The expression/sustain pedal is shockingly tiny! The headphones have scratchy phone ear pads and are terrible. Lots of offers for online tutorial programs which you may or may not be interested in.

My suggestion is to avoid buying this, even if it comes with a bundle. Instead, buy a power supply (it is possible to buy some Yamaha keyboards with the power supply included in the box, but make sure the listing actually says the power supply is included. For most Yamaha keyboards, you will need to buy the power supply separately. Stupid move, Yamaha).

Also, buy a full size sustain pedal, as you will likely lose the tiny one contained in the little survival kit box, because the pedal is so small. Either that or you will crush it.",0
868,"The Hipshot A style brass bridge is my favorite bass bridge so I got the Hipshot KickAss (black one) just to try it on my Jazz bass and it came unfinished. For the price that you pay and the Hipshot name you would think that their quality control would be better. Did the people at Hipshot expect the customer to actually finish the piece? I might as well get a Chinese version which will probably come with a good finish but cost me a fraction of the money. I think this is definitely an embarrassment to the company. But I thought I would give this bridge a second chance just to be fair. Maybe this was a single bad bridge that got through the line. Well, I have to say that it was a good thing that I reordered the bridge because this second bridge was just beautiful. Finally I got a good one and not one that should have been a reject.
It was well made and heavy with lots of mass. The feel of the bridge is very high end and you get good sustain. The sound is very clear with pronounced notes. It feels very good when you play the strings. It certainly gives your bass a high end feel. This second one I got has the chrome finish. I am very happy with this one, at last.  I would recommend this specific one that I got the second time to anyone looking for an excellent bass bridge for their Jazz bass or Precision bass. If only they had competent people working in their finishing department, I would say the same thing about all of them.
UPDATE:
Since the above purchase I have bought two more of these (including a five string version) for some of my Fender basses. These bass bridges have turned out to be some of the best bridges I have used. But I have had to return a couple of them because of lower quality finishes which has been very frustrating..
As far as design is concerned, Hipshot has come up with a winner with these. It's like the Leo Quan Badass bridge but on steroids. Excellent feel, sound and sustain.
Sadly I feel I would be doing the customers on Amazon an injustice if I gave this bridge a five star rating
I have returned three of these so far. I have purchased three of these. That's a 50/50 chance that you have on getting a good one. This shows that their quality control is not doing their job.
Do yourself a favor and get the Leo Quan bad ass bridge or the Omega bass bridge which is a copy of the Bad ass bridge. That's what I will do in the future.",0

870,"I don't know if this is a new thing with all Gator racks, or just the 2U, but for some reason they've made two changes with kind of suck

1) They've swapped which portion of the rack has the hooks, and which portion has the clasps. The clasps are now on the rack, not the lids. This is reverse of my 4 space gator rack and often leads to some fumbling around since I'm used to holding the clasps as I remove the lid. Same with putting the lids on - it makes much more sense to hold the lid by the clasps and put it on the rack

2) The new handle sucks. Big time. It's not the nice bar of extruded aluminium, it's a cheesy nylon strap now with a thin strip of metal at each end where it slides in/out of the case. I keep a really heavy Fryette 2/90/2 tube guitar power amp in this rack and I'm not confident this handle is up to the task for the long haul.",0

Gonna give it one more shot because it actually does sound ok.",0
872,Just didn't work for me.  The screen printing in the pedal was not good.  Aside from that I had a hard time getting the rythym and bass patterns I wanted. Maybe it wasn't well suited to my musical style.  I would not reccoment this as a practice tool.,0

I was wrong.

Months later I'm having horrible tuning issues on my bass.  Replaced my tuners, checked the neck, did a truss adjustment, adjusted the bridge saddles.  Nothing was working.  It was when I was adjusting the bridge saddles and noticing how extreme of an adjustment I was having to do just to get a slight change I looked closely at the bridge.  It had bent, probably a solid 1/16 of an inch plus up from the body.  Luckily I held on to my old hardware.  Threw it back on checked the tuning and it was perfect again.

They had me mail this amp in for repairs (its very heavy, it cost me 65 dollars in shipping alone).  That was on February 1st of 2013.  They held my amp for months and will not return it now (its April 4th, 2013).  I have been treated rudely and horribly by nearly every person I have spoken with.

I am a frequent customer on Amazon, and when I contacted them to let them know about this problem (since there was no third party vendor involved)THEY DID NOTHING TO HELP ME other than to tell me to get the ""authorities"" involved. I am re-evaluating my whole relationship with Amazon because of this issue.

You can look at my other reviews on here, I am a very reasonable person.  In fact, I am updating my previous review of this product that praised its economic value.  I am not prone to bad-mouthing products, but the way I have been treated in regard to this warranty issue is criminal.

I keep trying to talk myself into thinking its adequate for her, but every time I plug into it I get super frustrated and feel guilty. I'll probably get to a point where I sell it for a loss.

On original playing they turned my fingers black. Not a big deal and may be due to body chemistry.
A big complaint: very annoying finger squeaks on the wound strings. (Not so with Elixirs.)
They may last a long time but I'll never know as I will replace immediately with Elixirs.
In summary:  mediocre sound, extremely difficult to control squeaking on wound strings, and not worth a premium price. I'm sorry I wasted time and money on these strings.",0

890,"This may be a good multitrack recorder but I expected something way different from this unit. I expected to be able to record two tracks, left and right, off a mixer as a stereo signal to WAV format and then transfer that file to a computer... not a chance!  Not without sooo many steps and so much time.
Records only to its own proprietary format.  Mixdown to a useable format is in realtime... no speedy file coversion here... two hour recording = two more hours for mixdown, at least.  Produces two seperate files, not one stereo file.

Ate my 16gig HDSD card; the Tascam formatted it, couldn't read it after that.  My computer and camera can still read it... they see it as a 4gig card now.

The unit came with a wrong button... a play button "">"" was in the stop button place so I had two play buttons instead of a play button and a stop button.

The front of the unit has a nice feel.  The knobs feel solid.  The battery cover on the back doesn't feel right at all.
You have to remove the batteries to get to the SD card slot.
Didn't find the user interface intuitive at all, but then I wanted it to do something it wasn't designed to do.

Like I say, maybe a perfect unit for desperate multitracking... wouldn't call the thing a recorder in any practicle sense.

Sent it back, am going for a Zoom H2, but wish it had 1/4"" inputs.

Update to review: March 2010
See the comments to this review, I was unaware that the unit partitions SD cards and I could have recovered the card.
I ended up buying the Zoom H4n, now over a year ago.  I love it.  I has 4 channel capabilities and can mix down the tracks.  It costs more.  See my review there.  It's simple to use and does an amazing job.  Between the H4n and Audacity, WavePad, and Free Audio Editor (all free audio editing programs) I can edit, mix, and add affects to my recordings to my hearts content, or of course I could do it all on the H4n but why would anyone unless they were stuck on a desert island with nothing but their recorder?  It just makes sense to me to do the mixing and editing on a computer.  Anyhow, I still think the DP-004 was a poorly interfaced unit that was worthless to me.",0

Also I had to adjust the sensitivity for each kit every time I used it. I couldn't save my changes. What a hassle! Also the rubber rims on the snare and toms breaks down after just a couple hours of use. Alesis doesn't sell replacements , so I had to buy them on eBay. pOs. Try a Roland or ddrum.

896,"been using computers for 9 years now. Always been willing to learn, study, read the manuals, etc, but truth is, whenever I try, I feel dreadful, as if I have to bust my butt just to understand how to do stupid basic things, like quantize, overdub etc.

Felt like that for 9 years. And I really tried. Manuals always suck, feels like you have to prepare to pilot a spaceship before you learn how to do stupid basic things like overdub, loop, export to a specific format, etc.  You'd think you just need to search in the index, type 'overdub' and read how to do it, yes? Well, think again. A zillion times I typed common technical terms like 'punch in' , 'overdub' etc, only to have the goddamn 'manual' return the search with ZERO results. So what you do? You start reading random stuff. Before long, you even forget what the heck it was you wanted to do, losing your focus. This never happened with standalone digital multitrackers.

I didn't want to be too hasty with my decision, so I tried my best to warm up to it.  Sadly, it just doesn't do the job.  I believe the recent Cordoba's built in China are a gamble as I have noted some questionable build quality on others I have seen (poorly glued sections, jagged frets on sides of fingerboard).  The more expensive Cordoba guitars made in Spain are superior in build and tone.  I previously owned another Cordoba which is now discontinued (Flamenco Model 30F) and recall that it was vastly superior.  The GK Studio is lifeless and weak, which isn't a surprise given the small body.  I went as far as to try others at various music stores; all were a disappointment.  My best description is that it sounds like a toy.  If you are in the market for a flamenco guitar, please look elsewhere.  I have played the Manuel Rodriguez C3 Flamenco guitar and Yamaha CG172SF Flamenco guitar and think they're a much better value with a superior sound.  I wouldn't dare say they are the best guitars on the planet, but they are better than the GK Studio.  I cannot comment on its sound while amplified; I don't usually amplify my acoustic guitars.

It really looks like I'm going to have to rip it all off to clean off the old glue and do it all over again with a better glue. The pro for this mute, however, is that it's very out of the way.

I'd suggest getting a rubber violin mute. You have to cut a groove into on one edge to make it fit the full length of the bridge, but it works great. It protrudes quite a bit though (an extra ~1/4"" from the bridge). I personally like resting my hand on it, but if you don't like that protrusion, it's a problem.",0

Both of the others have cracked on the sound hole lip. The material is too fragile. It needs to be a little more flexible. Having said that, it does project the sound  better when playing acoustic without amplification in a dead room. Nice for small venue performance, because you can sing with a mic and not worry about amplifying the guitar. Have not tried it with amplification options.",0

947,"I initially loved this product. I recorded my first album with Logic and was generally happy with the purchase. The only snag was I lost several .wav files....vocal takes of a singer from another country. I normally back my stuff up, but it was the perfect storm and I lost all the takes. I don't know what caused this to happen however I know I have heard from others how Logic sometimes causes your takes mysteriously vanish. Nonetheless I looked past this and continued to mostly enjoy Logic. HOWEVER as my second album progressed I noticed bugs cropping up like tidal waves (Sudden Motion detector etc) and would try workarounds and questions to Apple. Neither helped.

Here are my rankings from 1-5:

Quality/Ease of Recording - 2.
This is largely interface driven ( I have the apogee duet) however it is simple to record (in theory) with Logic. The punch-in is a bit quirky and needs improvement. But the quality of output is solid. The sudden motion detector bug caused a lot of headache though getting some takes recorded.

Media/Loops - 5
Apple loops are many and diverse and to boot they are pristine sounding. You could warrant buying Logic for the loops alone.

Technical Support - 1
Apple customer service doesn't exist unless you pay for an ""Apple Care"" like product. Not customer friendly. My questions to them went unanswered and I had to use threads on the Apple site and as well as 3rd party sites. Let me ask you....when you pay $500 plus for software, wouldn't you expect a dedicated customer service attempt to help resolve your issue? If you ask me this is the biggest deterrent for repeat purchases. Apple hasn't had a Logic update in over a year. They are ignoring their customers. Hence I will be giving Pro Tools a shot.

Presets - 3.  Some good ones. I thought the amp designer is a great idea but the majority of the sounds aren't special. They should have more brand like features ( like a Led Zep guitar tone) They do have a capable suite of effects.

Mixing/Editing - 3
Automation and panning are a breeze as well as using Midi. Flex time and varispeed are good ideas and can help in certain situations. Varispeed could be unbelievable if the quality of the recording wasn't compromised. The greater percentage of the change in tempo, the less authentic the original take sounds. This is to be expected with this type of effect but even 4% changes caused big discrepancies. The sudden motion detector bug again caused issues during playback.

Overall I would give this software 2.5 out of 5. This software has potential but ""potential"" isn't enough to warrant a purchase.",0
948,"Pretty good sounding pedal overall, I really was wanting to use it more, but the hissing sound it generates is more then I can handle. Ebay here we go.",0
949,"This cable is mediocre at best. For the price it's okay, but it's noisy when used with powered speakers. Other imported brands on Amazon perform a lot better and feel more sturdy than this flimsy.",0
950,"Excellent sonic fidelity, solidly built, gets quite warm when running. I've yet to get it working well with my brand new Macbook Pro and Ableton Live 9.0.  Yet to determine if issue is more with Ableton eating up CPU. What I can say is that pops and clicks were not often present when I was using my Apogee Duet with Ableton.  Spent many hours troubleshooting.  Only way I'm using it now is by constantly adjusting sample rate and buffer size and using hardly any plugins while tracking. Once tracking is done I make the buffer size huge which in turn causes major latency. A bit bummed out and back and forth with tech support.
Ableton Live 9 users should be cautious before buying.",0
951,"Appears to be a quality cable, and does the trick nicely. Buy with confidence. WOULD purchase again.

953,"These didn't turn out to be what the reviews implied. I wanted to try out some new brands for my Les Paul Signature. I figured anything would probably be better than it's stock Gibson strings. I was surprisingly wrong.

I find these DRs to be a bit on the stiff/unresponsive side and ive been coming out of tune more frequently than before. The tone is absolutely nothing special and the sustain is unremarkable. they are fine cheap strings but I guess I was fooling myself into believing somehow these would be as good as more expensive sets. Im going to go for some Ernie Ball Colbalts or Elixirs next.",0
954,"The entire guitar is plastic.  I bought it to replace my old wooden one but it's all plastic.  So the sound is different, the feel is different.  If you are looking for a wooden guitar- this is not it.  It's more of a novelty item than my old wooden one- which I loved and recorded with and played everyday.",0

957,"Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.
Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.",0
958,It worked about 10 minutes and started cutting out. Sent it back.,0
959,"Two strings broke before I ever got to play on them. I love D'Addario, which is why it makes me sad to only give them one star.
I wouldn't be surprised to find out these are fakes, because this is not the D'Addario quality standard I know and love.",0
960,"Be warned!  It does not say so in the description, but there is no EQ on the four stereo channels.  No solo or mute, buttons either; as well as no power switch (although I expected that from other Behringer small form mixers I've used).  If, like me, you can't see the pictures, you may be surprised by some of these, especially the lack of stereo channel EQ.
The description also doesn't mention that the send is post-fader, in case that matters to you.

Also, this seems much more cheaply made than the old version of this mixer (I think it used to be metal!).  In short, Behringer still has some good products (such as the nifty little UCA202), but their really starting to disappoint me with their smaller mixers.
Having used the three channel version of this, I know it does not take much to get the nobs to start shorting, and so the lack of a mute button (meaning you must use level to turn off a channel) is a potentially big problem down the road.
The use of a proprietary power supply connection format is also a negative in my view--can't replace it with a universal p/s if something goes wrong.  This is definitely not road worthy equipment.

Sending it back and getting one from a different manufacturer (Sampson or Nady).",0
961,"This item works as far as not having to drill additional holes into your guitar top, but it forces you to raise the bridge action therefore raising string distance from neck to string action.

Plenty of crappy gear is well known, it is well built but for me it's a one trick pony and it's trick is too subtle for my taste and never has lived up to it's hype or popularity in my opinion. I own one and never use it there are far superior pedals in my lineup that sound so much cleaner and stronger and better",0

These pieces of junk are made in Indonesia.  The brand is owned and operated by Hohner, and their office and warehouse is in an office park in Richmond Virgina.

The closest they ever came to having even the slightest thing to do with Hawaii is years ago when they were first starting the brand out, they had Kanilea Uke company building ukes for them.  Those are the only Lanikai ukes worth getting, it's been downhill from there.

Today I tried it again and the lid popped right off, dumping a handful of beads on the floor.  I would think the lids on each end would have been sealed with something to prevent this.

986,"This cable worked fine for a short while. I didn't put it through much abuse and the jack developed a break. The price was good and I have no complaints about it otherwise, but be wary of this jack design. There's no repairing it unless you buy a new jack and solder it yourself.",0
987,"Mediocre at best. Wish I hadn't bought 2 of these based on the reviews.... I suspect if you have an electric guitar with a skinny neck (or an acoustic with an electric neck, as PRS, Takamine, et alia seem to think is good), i.e., 1 11/16th"" or narrower at the nut, then this capo might work. But for a nut width of 1.75"" or more, no dice. The capo is barely wide enough to cover the strings, and even so it leaves the low E ""hanging""--buzzing, not quite clamped by the capo.

Pros:
Great sound quality. Well built. Easy to mount/attach. Long cord. Works well when close.

Cons:
Too quiet for some uses. (This is to be expected for such a microphone. Needs external amplification. Higher quality mics will have a greater impedance) Probably will NOT work as a desktop mic. That's why I got it, and I was disappointed to find it didn't work for me.",0

996,"I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.

The main problem with this tuner is the usability.
The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.

Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.
The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.
The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.

Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.

Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.

The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:

SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.
CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.
SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.
SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.
SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.

The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.

I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be.",0

I own & play flute, a Dixon Trad tinwhistle, the Yamaha Fife-corder, Low D Whistle (I even have the hard to play bamboo version Amazon sells, which sounds great btw), and I can make sweet sounding music on an old cheap plastic recorder with only 1 playable octave. This thing however, is truly terrible. Some reviewers are claiming they can actually play this piece of junk, which makes me think the quality control on these may occasionally allow a ""good"" one thru, purely by accident.

Here's the deal. Mine looks fine. The holes are fine, no obvious flaws. It does make noise, but I spent an hour trying to get anything resembling a musical note from it and only managed a few noises that sounded remotely musical, and they were faint, airy and distant.

I ended up getting a Mountain Ocarina, which plays beautifully, and has a very nice sound. I really should have payed more attention to the bad reviews of this horrible little piece of molded plastic - I can't call it an ocarina because it's really not. I was buying this for my 10yr old son as his first instrument. That didn't work out. Take my advice and buy something else, anything else.

1011,"The good: This is the best sounding pickup (mic, actually) for classical and flamenco guitars. By many a mile.
The bad: I had the steel string version installed on my triple-O copy, and after a month or so, it has sounded great but a wire harness and the battery pouch came unglued. I liked the sound so much I decided to have one installed in my 1978 Contreras. It sounded great for a week and a half, then went dead. Now I face the prospect of a likely destructive de-install and re-install on a 40 YO cedar topped guitar. I think Baggs is a little like Tesla. Really cool technology until the rocket blows up.
I have a feeling getting this resolved will be a painful interaction with Baggs (at fault, IMHO), the authorized dealer who installed it (did his job right, as far as I can tell, and I consider myself fairly knowledgeable), and my Contreras which is not likely to come through this unscathed.
I will consider an update to this review if Baggs ""makes me whole"" as the lawyers say. Otherwise, I am thoroughly disgusted.",0

These stupid boxes were treated like angel hair, and all three have been rendered useless. Don't trust this crud within an inch of my life, and will never use these again. Don't skimp out and be cheap, these are absolutely horrid. I had no say in the decision, but we are investing in some Whirlwind DI boxes that are much more reliable and durable.

My biggest problem with these amps is trying to decide which of the 4 awesome crunch tones to use, or which of the 3 screaming metal tones, or which of the really good cleans, etc, etc, etc.

1017,"High string action. Intonation is ok for a smaller size guitar. It is not a 3/4 size guitar which is fine. The bridge does not use pins to hold in the strings but ball end type strings are used and they slip through the slot on the bridge.

I plan to return this beautiful guitar and get him something else that, hopefully will be easier for him to play.--For me I give it only 2 stars due to playability. The guitar is not a toy but it is difficult for a beginner to play.

UPDATE: Not very pleased with seller's approach to handling customer service and unhappy customers. I got a return authorization. I have to pay the shipping back to seller. UPS wanted about $27 to ship to seller. Too high. I paid about $50 for the guitar. Took the guitar to the US post office and shipped for about $16. Plus, with the RA from seller they will debit from my refund about $7 for the initial shipment to me. I lost money on this deal and got nothing for it other than a bad taste in my mouth for the seller---WOODWIND AND BRASSWIND--which I will give ONE STAR ONLY and will avoid at all cost for any future purchases here on Amazon...I'll stick with Music123 when possible for they are responsive and offer and honor their coupons.",0
1018,"I read an review where i giy complained and now i wish i would habe bought a differnt interface.  It is a good quality devise but two thing make me feel this company has gone from professional to scamming people.  That is a bit harsh i lnow.  So its not a scam.  Bit the issuse is.  I have a protools system.  I buy this thing.  It works off softwere plug in.  When you go to instal they fource you to load the four packages they give you for free but also about thirty other demos.  So now my plug ins list is a disaster.  Like i am supose to remember the 50-100 options and the names.  So you call up a nrw plug in.  And its a demo you can buy for 300 bucks.  Im not cheap.  I paid 60,000 for my previois pro tools systemer and 750,000 for my stufio build out.  But if i purchased all the pligins it would be a number way more than the machine i got.  So now what.  I guess i have to go through every plug in write down the names find them in the plug ins folder through them out then re check everything to see of i got everything.  All becauae this stupid company is trying to shove product down my throat.  Again i have owned a two room professional studio for over twenty five years.  Audio gear is supose to give you a rush and get you excited.  There is not one other peoce of gear that has ever vandalized my work envirenment.  I pray US sees this post.  And changes their policy.  Because i will never buy the other five interfaces.  Aand either will others. This os short sided marketing by greedy bean counters.  I feel i should twke the company to court.  I am in the middle of a job getting paid 100 per hour.  I upgrade my interface and now i need to take two days off to clean house.  Because ot will twke too long to go through the list in front of a client.  Shame on you UA.  And get your ass over here and clean out your stupid plugins from my computer.  Last note check my reviews of other products on amazon.  I give a lot of five star reviews.

I will try and get ohotos of my demo pligins list from hell.

1040,"These Delrin picks aren't bad, but if you are expecting them to glue themselves to your finger & thumb, you might be a bit disappointed.
Delrin is a very slick material.  It glides across the strings of a guitar very nicely.  That's the good news.
The not-so-good news is, Delrin also seems to glide across the fingers as nicely as it does the strings- which is exactly what we were trying to avoid when we bought these picks, isn't it?
For this grip concept to work, you have to choke up on the pick enough to place the cutout in it on the ball of your thumb.  I don't choke up on a pick enough to gain any benefit from these.  Maybe you do.
In my opinion, this would be far more effective if the cutout was located farther back from the tip.
Below is a photo of a similarly designed (blue) pick that, in my opinion, is better executed.  I like the Torx-type cutout and I especially like that the cutout is placed where I can take advantage of it.
Unfortunately, the (blue) pick in the photo was given to me and I don't know who manufactures/markets it.  If I knew, I would buy more of those.",0

They make a lot of great, inexpensive products similar in size to this one that actually emit sound and act like a mini, portable amp. Get one of those!

1053,"I tried Legere for a bit.  Not long.  I found two big problems with them:
1.  The Legere is a lot stiffer than the cane of the same size.  They may have fixed this since I last played on them, but I used to play on Mitchell Laurie 4 (sometimes 4.5) cane reeds and I couldn't get a single peep from a Legere 4 because it was too stiff.  I had to drop to a Legere 3.
2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.

I will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.  However, if you want a really great reed that will last a long time, give you awesome musical quality, and has a sound similar to (but crisper than) regular cane, try Fibracell instead of Legere.",0

1066,"Honestly, this is not a good value. Many of the items are things that have better alternatives, are not needed, or can be made from household items.

All you really need is a swab and cork grease. And you likely already have grease. Get a silk swab instead, it absorbs more moisture, dries fast, and the same one can do the neck and body because it is lighter weight. A pad/neck saver is nice to have as well so long as you do not store them inside the instrument when wet.

Cleaning swab:
- You get two sizes, these are lightweight napkin style cloths with nylon cord stitched diagonally. There's a weight on the end of the cord. The large swab has a cord on both sides, which allows you to swab out the body of your sax quickly. The small works fine for the neck and mouthpiece. It's a lightweight citton material and is slow drying. These work well and do not easily get snagged on things like microfiber would, but get stuck more often than silk.

Mouthpiece brush:
- Your standard nylon bottle brush. A swab will be enough for regular cleaning if you brush your teeth before playing. A tooth brush works better for scrubbing down gunk.

Polishing cloth:
- Usless for lacquered/nickeled/enameled instruments. Using it on such finishes will just scratch them. This is a very stiff/low pile microfiber cloth you would use to polish bare metal. If your sax is silver or bare brass, this is the kind of cloth you would use to shine it up and remove tarnish. For general cleaning and wipe down after use for all other finishes, just use a standard soft microfiber cloth with a decent pile / fluff, which absorbs more and doesn't scratch.

Cork grease:
- Great, easy to use, chapstick style applicator. Standard quantity. You probably already have plenty which came with your instrument.

Pad paper:
- Mostly useless. It is a thin woven material that absorbs little and dries fast. You can just use a cut piece of microfiber cloth instead, which will work better for absorbing moisture and is reusable. Use pinking shears if you have. Really, you can use a piece of printer paper, or something like a dollar bill in a pinch.

Tone hole cleaners:
- 100% useless. It's just pipe cleaner. If you need, pick up a pack of 100 pipecleaners for a few dollars. If you don't eat while playing, and brush your teeth every few days, you won't ever see any dirty/cloged tone holes. Also, its better not to touch the tone holes, because it is easy to damage the lacquer and pads on acident.

Care and maintenance manual:
- Basic stuff. To summarize: unfold your swabs before running them through so they don't bunch up and snag on things. Dry your swabs before putting them away. When cleaning pads, lift the pad with its key, slide the absorbant material under, close the pad. Wait a second. Do not remove material by sliding it out with tone hole closed. Lift the pad with the key, remove the material while the tone hole is open. 100% common sense.",0

1069,"The new design of these capo's now have a stop built in where you can't back off the tension any further than a certain point.  The ""Stop"" is also the pick holder built in.  The entire reason I chose the Planet Waves capos in the past was that you could set the capo with exactly how much tension you needed in order to stop the guitar from pulling sharp.  Well this new design, the minimum tension allowed by the capo is TOO MUCH.  I cannot use this capo on any of my guitars with jumbo frets as it pulls sharp.  Also, there seems to be a higher pull on the low E string than on other strings.

I miss the old design of these.  I had used the older model for 6 years until it broke finally.  Still haven't identified a suitable replacement.",0

1071,"---------- Buyer Beware:
This is a fancy box containing the same harmonicas as the:
""Hohner Special 20 Harmonica 3 piece Pro Pack keys of G,C,A""
Check the prices of both items before choosing which to buy. The only difference between the two is the packaging.

At the time I wrote this review, there was a $20 difference between the two on Amazon (This package is more expensive). This may vary over time depending on promotions.

----------Note on which key to buy first:
The selection of keys: G, C, A is not exactly the one I would recommend for complete beginners.
--I recommend starting with a key of C.
This is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner.
--Then in this order: D, A.
A is common in blues and country. D is also common and often considered easier to play than the C (the 2-draw should be easier)
--Then F, G, Bb, E,...
I would argue for the last 4 in this order, but here is gets more debatable. Of course, there are even more keys and variations beyond the ones listed. Feel free to add your opinion, since this tends to vary between players.

----------Hohner Special 20:
-(****_) overall: My preferred beginner harmonica, recommended to anyone as a first harmonica, and to experienced players who want the best harmonica at this price point. Anything less expensive will lack in quality and be difficult to play, which could turn off an aspiring player. It's good enough that many experienced players will never find a need to spend more on a harmonica. Not rated higher because you get what you pay for, and my preferred harmonicas are in the higher price range.
-(****_) Sound: Excellent. Loved it, and one of its strongest point. It's good enough to make a song truly enjoyable. Even as a beginner you can get a nice sound. It's not as good as top-end harmonicas but I never realized that or cared until I owned a top-end harmonica.
-(*____) Durability: The real achille's heel of the Special 20. This harmonica will not last. The brass reeds are not durable, reason why many top-end manufacturers use different reed materials specifically to improve durability (at a higher price point). Within a few months my harmonica had to be replaced.
-(****_) Playability: The comb is made of plastic and protrudes, which makes it slide nicely. The holes are easy to single out for a beginner. The notes are easy to bend. The biggest disadvantage is some notes tend to get stuck and over time make the harmonica difficult to play. IMPORTANT: 1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play. Admittedly, the 2-draw on the Special 20 is difficult to play (arguably more than usual).
-(***__ Aesthetics): A pretty decent looking harmonica. The case looks fine. Feel perfectly happy with it, but it doesn't have the look and feel of top of the line harmonica like a Suzuki Firebreath or Promaster.

-----------Comparison with other Harmonicas:
--(**___ overall) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20 (the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band 1896 Classic.
--(***__ overall) Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic: Great beginner harmonica at an affordable price. It has a wood comb. I slightly prefer the sound of the Special 20, the plastic comb of the Special 20 slides easily, and its holes are easy for a beginner to single out, so my preference goes to the Special 20.
--(***** Overall) Suzuki Firebreath: Amazing. Not cheap, so I recommend the Special 20 as a first harmonica until you decide you're going to stick with the instrument. Even if you're ""sure"" you'll stick, I still recommend starting with the Special 20 because beginners are more likely to misuse and break their harmonicas, and so you get the pleasure of looking forward to and appreciating your future upgrade.
--(***** Overall) Suzuki Promaster: Amazing. Same comments are the firebreath.",0

Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. Well, I want to clear this up once and for all. IT IS TOO SMALL! Specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depending on your guitar), AND it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. This thing really is a puzzler. I mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. HOWEVER, a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. Cheers!",0
1077,"The box came opened - the packaging is very cheap - poor quality cardboard. Hardware was loose - and some missing. The cranks work well - in both directions. The unit is heavy - will be a challenge to carry both in my truss bag. The tripods are sturdy. assembling the truss is a challenge - especially slipping the plastic clamps over the pipes. Once the truss is assembled - which is 10 feet, you have to lift it and place it into the clamps. Simply impossible to do with one person. This will have to me modified for any sort of single person use.

Once it is assembled and up - I can see it being an asset - allowing the lights to be placed before raising the truss. Note here that even at its lowest - the truss is pretty high.

One work around I can imagine is to lay the tripods on the floor. assemble it - and then pick it up. Again, you will need two people because of the weight of the tripods.

That said - the tripods impress me as being quality pieces. No T bars - and the upper poles are smaller than my other light tripods.

Had I known I would have likely purchased the tripods with the triangle truss that fits on top. More money - but I think much more serviceable for a single person show.

1098,"I wanted to like this.  The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out.
There are 2 problems with this:

1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.

2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top ""Y"" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.

Overall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.  For all you other sax players out there, move on and try something else.",0

1107,"Chin rest options are plentiful and cheap elsewhere online. This chin rest is popular, because it's one of few options actually on Amazon. The clamp is extremely cheaply made, and the shape of the scoop is very low-innovation. I would suggest any new player begin by making a list of things they don't like about how their Guarneri fits them and look through photos of various chin rest styles on Google to find one you think will be more comfortable. Once you find a style you think will suit you, order it from an online store. It won't cost much different.

On top of the whitewashed Amazon selection, the concept of a center-positioned chin rest is extremely faulty. The violin needs tilted quite a bit to reach the lower strings comfortably without compromising technique. The center-positioned chin rests leave the instrument much-more-flat/horizontal than side chin rests. It also points the violin much more forward than off to the side.

Not only did I find that I didn't need this extra preamp to make my guitar sound better, it actually made it sound worse! First off, the construction of this item is horribly cheap and antiquated. If I were K&K, I would pull this product from the market immediately before buyers of the Pure Mini begin to suspect their pickup had the same poor quality. This thing is so cheaply made, I would be shocked if it had more than a $5 BOM cost (and they're selling it for $100!!!!????). From the cheap metal aluminum bend-work, the horrible knob feel (tiny little old knobs, no center lock, no idea if it's at ""10"" or ""1""), to the huge cavity of useless space inside and the horribly loud ""flack"" it makes when you plug your guitar cable in (a sign of SUPER cheap componentry) and even the INSANE amount of feedback it CAUSED my guitar to make!! I was shocked at overall how poorly made, how cheap this product felt, and how negatively it impacted my sound. When you consider some fine boutique pedals retail for $20-30 more than this costs, it's insulting. Buy this if you want, but first check if you're ""problem"" isn't the 1hz impedance issue that is explained on the internet (which the AS50D is compatible with). I actually found that my guitar sounds awesome plugged directly into the Marshall amp with NO feedback...even cranked up. Whereas this immediately started to feedback at low volume levels...squalling anytime my hand was off the strings!

if you are one of the many who are easily satisfied with...like,
hey the guitar sounds good !
then, you will be very happy with these.

it is good for home use, for general listening, and
connection to tv, etc... not bad for that ...

please LEARN how to place these..
never place any spkrs just ON a table..
experiment with mats, spikes, standoffs, etc...
and WHERE to place them in your room,
AWAY from WALLS please.

for us, these are not even close to real monitor spkrs,
so we wish yamaha would please
HONESTLY rename them accordingly...
their OWN  MSP5  are getting a bit more closer to what
the name Monitor aspires to....but
alas, even the MSP5 are not true monitors...

but again, for MANY and most who are doing recordings
in smaller home studios...we recommend the
MSP5 over the yamaha HS series...

if you wish to Learn what a better monitor sounds like,
and monitors are supposed TO REVEAL THE SOUNDS IN MOST FREQUENCIES
CLEARLY and ACCURATELY,
and not muddling them, first and foremost..that is why you need a monitor...
then,
go take a listen  at the Adam A7x...  ( adam a3x...hmmm...still debating on that...)

that might be a  good STARTING reference point..and then
work your way back to yamaha...
noting what you lose in sound....clarity and other things...

and, we might cause a Stampede here, but pls go Listen and then
BUY the Fostex pm0.3 and the fostex pm0.4
These are QUITE A BIT  better than the HS series yamaha,
( in that they are SO SANE and CLEAR !!! )  and possibly
you might like these two fostex over the yamaha MSP5 even !
and guess what,  these fostex are FAR cheaper too, altho with less
amp power ,,,but CLEAN and honest, they are...
of course,
still very far from the likes of Adam a7x or the meyers !
ha !....

if your music does NOT require musical accuracy nor Truth,
( such things are VERY much required in a classical concert, etc )

and you go and use all sorts of effects and plugins anyway
hey,yes, the yamaha is for you please ! you need all the bells and
whistles you can find...heck, go and use any
speaker you like by color even...sound clarity and truth to original
signal are the last thing on your list...

however, yamaha is not totally un useable ..it will suffice for
most of the so called music out there...
where clarity is not crucial...and recording quality is not serious.

I would have bought a CGP-700 if only my trust in Casio was still there...,0
1168,"My guitar students use this, and I might someday. My only complaint so far is the difficulty in feeling the On/Off button on each lamp, as you can't really see them in dim light (your reason for needing a light in the first place, right?) And I think the power cord is short by more than a foot, IMHO.
After a couple months of VERY gentile use the light went out during yesterday's guitar lesson. I unplugged and plugged it in again and it worked, until I put the USB to AC adapter back on the floor, then it went out again. I worked with it today and found the problem to be the loose connection between the USB plug and the adapter. It didn't get loose from wear or movement, so it's a defect in design. It will probably work with batteries, but THIS IS UNRELIABLE AS AN AC POWERED LIGHT! Do not buy!",0

If you have an instrument with a smooth finish, it is very easy for the front of the stand to spread wide open and allow your uke or other small instrument to touch the floor and, depending on the surface, get scratched.  Unless you place your instrument on the rubber components at exactly the right angle, the legs are just too unstable.  I have tile at home, and that is exactly what happened to me.
The stand has a fairly smart design.  If they enhance it with a way to keep the front of the stand at fixed distance while fully deployed, then it will be a great value.  Otherwise, either be very careful or just avoid it.",0

1185,"I bought this as a small practice amp hoping for 1 good clean and metal sound each.  The Fender Twin sound was the only (barely) useable clean sound, but all the metal tones sounded like pure modeling garbage.  Perhaps the larger size/wattage versions of this amp handle the tones better, but I could not get any good sounds out of it after couple of hours spent tweaking.  I even tried toying around with the Fender Fuse software (which itself is pretty nice to use), but dear God - every sound was either too muffled or too harsh.  And for you spring reverb fanatics, the spring reverb  is nothing like a real tank, so don't waste your time there.

I would highly the Blackstar ID15 TVP as a far better alternative to this amp - it's more expensive, but the clean (while not Fender like) is at least nice and the metal tones are great.",0

And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.
I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.

I use these things every day and it's happened about 7 times now where I will turn them off to either switch an input source or go do something else, and then inevitably one of them will not turn back on when I switch them back on. I have to turn it off and leave it off for about twenty minutes before it will turn back on. BOTH speakers have displayed this problem. I've swapped out everything, it's not a problem with power or audio signal, and my studio is nice and cool (as are the speakers when they fail) so they aren't getting overheated.  It is very clearly just a defective product.

Like I said, they sound amazing when they're on and working.  But I have a home studio that I'm trying to run and if these things don't turn back on in the middle of a session with a client, there goes twenty minutes of my client's time, and a blow to my reputation.  They are completely unreliable for professional studio monitors.  I will be contacting JBL to see what they can do, but for BOTH speakers to fail right out of the box is ridiculous.",0

Where the pedal I have now sounds very clean.",0

My amp was noisy with some individual pots much noisier than others and a low background hiss throughout all outputs.  I only use it when I need more headphone distribution, otherwise I'll grab the signal off the board and send it into the tracking room. Clearly this piece of equipment was designed and built for those who want something that looks pro, but costs less... so, quality control problems and cheap components are what you get.  I won't purchase another item from this manufacturer, unless it comes highly recommended.  At some point, I'll probably replace the HA4700 with an ART HeadAmp Pro 6 which I've been able to check out at a friends studio and which seems superior for the price.

Cheaper, thinner, less dense plastic.  Selector switch has a visibly pronounced plastic seam.

The pickup covers and knobs are acceptable, but only because they aren't visible from any distance.

Fender would never use these parts on their flagship line of guitars.  I cannot comprehend why they would attach their name to such low quality replacement parts.",0

If you have anything heavy in the bag the Velcro that holds them in place isn't going to hold up. At the end of the day it's just ok. If you are counting on using it as a rolling bag stay away.

Also, these knobs are hollow. I've got speed knobs that look similar to these on the outside, but they are solid. These are hollow, like a cup, with a stem in the middle with a hole in the stem where you the post of your potentiometer goes into.

Would I order them again? No, now that I know what they are, I would not order or recommend them. I have some nice hefty metal black knobs I'll use instead of these; these go in the garbage.

1228,Cheap crap,0
1229,"On the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing.  They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.

They don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.

I previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.

I was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.  Maybe Behringer 3031a's or something.  I think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.",0
1230,I tried every trick I know (short of gluing them on) to get them to stick and both fell off after a couple of taps of the cajon.  The suction cup mic I've been using for years stays on with no problem.  Sadly I threw away the packaging when they came or I'd return them.  Worthless to me.,0

1234,I read the reviews and I can't believe people like these capos....the curvature is way too much for most guitars and thus pulling them out of tune.  The rubber part that touches the string is inconsistent and had that weird white residue all over it.

1236,"I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality. I bought two more of these recently, one black one brown. They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone.

Original review - 1st purchase:
This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).",0
1237,"Don't waste your time with these cables. I bought 2 of them. One of them was already broken and the other broke after a month or so.

Don't make the same mistake I did: spend a bit more money (even just $10 more) and you can get cables that are 1000 times more reliable than these. To be honest I'm pretty shocked at how many good reviews these are getting. If I had only bought 1 and it turned out not so good, I might've given them the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that both cables were complete duds makes it pretty evident that this is just a bad product.",0

1239,"The first time I tried these strings was on March 27th 1979. Not only did I find them quite shrill, less than 24 hours later the partial meltdown at the 3 Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred.

Then years later I heard some changes had been made to this product so I thought I'd give them another shot. That was on April 25th 1986 and again less than a day later another disaster at a nuclear facility, the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine. Coincidence? Perhaps.

Finally in early March 2011, with the advent of the newly developed ""Nanoweb"" coating I decided to give these strings one last try. Those poor people at Fukushima.

I would highly recommend you not use these strings and try John Pearse 200L's instead. Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them?",0

I will never again buy these, which is sad since it may be an isolated case.  Also, I will put new ends on these - maybe get a little justification from buying them.  They looked fine, cable part seems nice, but I don't think I will trust cables with the ""crimped"" or ""pressed on"" ends any longer.

Ever seen a beautiful oil painting with a signature so large it takes away from the art?  That's the idea here.  Wrong color, cheap tin, cheaply attached with rivets, and crooked, to boot!  And all of the latches work fine, except for the one which locks.  The bottom piece was attached a millimeter to low, and the top piece just barely wants to fit - something that is going to wear down horribly and before its time.  Unfortunately, it's attached in a way that cannot be fixed.  Hey, Stagg, where's your quality control?",0
1247,"I bought this with high hopes as I play both ukulele and guitar (Kamaka uke and Ramirez guitar) I have a need for a little backpack instrument and Yamaha is exceptional at its price in its lower line classical guitars.  Unfortunately, this instrument has very poor fretting and intonation even compared to a lower priced ukulele.  It is marginally acceptable for first position chords, but if finger picking or classical guitar or ukulele is your thing, you will be very disappointed.  Also, the frets are very cramped, more than either of my ukuleles and very hard to play, and I have very small hands. Construction is good at its price point but it has little resonance; again a medium priced uke sounds better. The neck needs a complete redesign and the instrument should be revoiced. A good guitarlele such as that built by KoAloha is about a thousand dollars so I was probably expecting too much.",0

In addition, the arms simply don't stay in place, tending to droop down and ""trap"" the guitar when one tries to remove it from the hanger... forcing you to use one hand to hold the guitar and the other to pry the hanger arms apart.

Further, the guitar neck may be stuck on the hanger prongs, damaging both the hanger and the guitar finish.

After several months, I cannot recommend these.  The more expensive wood-mounted versions are far better.  Or save some bucks, mount a piece of wood to the wall and screw in a coated U-hook to make a fine guitar hanger.",0

1258,"Okay, so far no 2 star reviews. Let me contribute to that particular category. The Mod Factory is affordable, versatile and offers the effects you would most likely expect under the label ""modulation"": Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Auto Wah, Tremolo etc. At each of the 11 positions of the bigger central dial, you get to fine adjust certain parameters with three additional mini controls. It's completely impossible to read the tiny (5pt.), bright-yellow-on-bright-green print, and even if you could, you'd get cryptic abbreviations such as ST or AW, so you'll have to mark your preferred effects somehow, or memorize their location on the dial. Ridiculous. The sounds themselves are alright. It took me a while to understand why they are so uninspiring. For some strange reason, they seem to suck all the energy out of your guitar signal. Others have described this problem as a ""volume drop"", but my impression is that that's not necessarily true, at least not in all cases. The effect feels somehow painted on top of your signal, not organically merged with it. If you like modulation effects as small touches of sonic color, in an intro here and there, or in a short portion of a solo, you'll be okay with this little box. If you're discerning about your tone, you should get a single good phaser or tremolo pedal that does one effect, and does it well, instead. This one's a bit of a joke.",0

Honestly, if your mic is has any weight to it, this won't hold it. This is suited for a smaller stage mic, but not a heavy condenser mic. My samson nearly fell on the floor trying to use this. The thing just doesn't lock well, and even locked, it will try to fall over. Pass on this if you want quality. The one I bought for a few bucks more (OnStage brand) does much better.",0
1263,A waste of money.,0
1264,"This is a ok tuner but understand you are not getting True Bypass so your tone can be affected even when you have the box turned off. The tolerances are not as tight similarly priced models. If you use batteries you will burn through them quickly due to the lack of True Bypass, if your using AC power then this isn't an issue. This is an ok starter pedal, but I would recommend spending the extra ten bucks and getting a tuner with tighter specs and true bypass.",0

1266,"I don't understand how this flimsy garbage gets such good reviews. It most certainly DOES feel like it's going to crack or break, if you lean to either side even slightly. I'm not even slightly overweight

I find myself using the height memory clamp to help stablize the seat at least a little, but then the stools height slowly lowers as I play... marring up/scratching the hell out of the post, just like it says in the video it won't do.  lol  Oh no it's not.. it's just grinding nylon bushing into it.

So I have a choice between really wobbly/nearly breaking seat and stable height,  or sort of more stable seat and kinda unstable height.

I guess under $100 is still not enough to get anything that isn't crap.

The wires are showing and it works, but keeps unplugging. The cord could be made more sturdier. It also comes with the Arturia sound VST, which is a library of hundreds of sounds.

EDIT: After ONE year, the port that you plug the piece into, has broken. It pushes in, when I plug in the cable, and only works when I'm pulling it out, AKA, it DOESN'T work. The cable is brand new as well. Money gone to waste. You know when they say ""What you pay is what you get""? This is one of those instances.

I contacted Arturia. First a lady asks for my info via email. I give it to her. Then another person asks for the same info. I give it to them. So since the warranty is up, I'll have to pay for repairs. I wait for a reply. One week goes by. Two. Then three. Now I send another email asking ""ARE YOU GOING TO REPLY AT ANY POINT OR NO"".

1297,"I am giving the violin two stars because it looks really cool and my son loved it in the box.

It really only deserves no stars though based on how the one I received DOESN'T work.

We have a number of amps and electronic guitars. We also have two children who are upper intermediate violin players. We thought we would suprise the boys by giving them a holiday present of an electric violin. We chose this inexpensive version on Amazon as a means to try it out on them to see if they would even be interested in playing. We had very low expectations based on the price, but we certainly did expect for it to make sound once plugged in.

No dice. No sound. The electronics are so cheap and marginally designed that we are certain that even if we exchanged this violin, the replacement would either not work, or be very short lived. It doesn't do us any good to spend money on something so poorly designed. The pickups not wired well. The electronics look like they are cheap and poorly set up. The body is made of poor materials, and the finish is poor. The bow - we won't even go there. We used our own bow because the hair was poor and the tightener screw seemed not to tighten properly. The G string - well, that unravelled immediately upon using the fine tuners by experienced violinists. If we intended on keeping the violin, we would know that we would have to replace all the strings. Even if we weren't expecting good sound!

Bottom line, this is as expected, cheap violin, and unfortunately, it is TOO cheap a set up to be functional even as a try out instrument for our family. Sadly, it will be going back for return.",0
1298,"This is the only transducer I have, so I don't know if this is normal to be this weak.  It's not very loud at all.

I could record while talking into the guitar and it will record my voice, along with any guitar handling noise or clothes shuffling.  All these things might be normal for a transducer, but if it's just accepted as being the norm and not fixed I cannot give it a high rating.

I later found out why it doesn't work with my other amp.  My other amp is a KEYBOARD amp.  It must have something to do with the type of impedance or voltage coming into the input.  Make sure to use a GUITAR amp with this product.",0

1308,"Re doing this review- sorry but its not good at all. Compared it to a few other amps, even an old Randall solid state RH- 100g2 blew it out of the water . Has no balls, not loud enough , high gain channel is generic like early 90's high gain 5150 or Soldano just not as good. No punch no definition . Very little low end. Lots of features though . The vari power doesn't work at all ( look at other reviews ), the rectifier switching you can barley tell the difference when switched ...although i did prefer it in the tube recto mode.

I hadn't had a tube amp in years , i live a ways out and had nothing to compare it to until recently. Once i played in next to a friends Marshall with a boss EQ , another Boogie and then my old randall...i realized how pathetic it was. The only good thing was the Clean channel while on tube recto with reverb . Got that amazing country chicken picking sound oddly enough.

When cranked it doesnt mud out like a solid state but it doesn't get big and bold either . Its just a real generic tone.

I was kinda liking it at first but that shows how long i have been away from "" good tone "".

1316,"I really wanted to like this microphone.  The multi-pattern setup, its slick looks, and good reviews on Amazon and YouTube made me very optimistic.  But after owning this for three entire days and testing it against my Samson CO1U (an $80 microphone), I ended up returning it.

PROS:
* Multi-pattern setup.
* Very attractive.
* Decent, though not great, sound quality.

CONS:
* Cost
* Required very high levels of gain (both on the microphone AND in the recording levels of my PC).
* Sound quality was decent, but not worth the cost, for me.

I called Blue Tech Support and they confirmed that the mic required very high levels of gain, but they didn't apologize for it saying ""some mics just require higher levels.""  However I'm using 100% of the gain on the microphone and 90% in my PC's recording settings -- that seems excessive to me.

Installing the Yeti Pro driver was a little weird, too.  The microphone didn't ""self-discover"" on the PC when I plugged in the cable (no big deal). But the directions in the brochure didn't match the steps you really had to perform to install the drivers.

Many have told me that using the analog cables and a separate interface is really the way to go.  They're probably spot-on.  But I had already exceeded my budget and didn't want to spend any more to make this microphone do what it was already designed to do all by itself.  Plus when I called support, Blue confirmed that the digital controls on the Yeti Pro won't work after you hook up the analog cables -- you'd be muting your recordings and adjusting your gain and headphone levels directly from the external interface unit, which you'd have to buy from your local music store (I guess I really shouldn't be surprised here since one is analog and one is digital).

In all, I only used the USB connection and was disappointed.  My $80 Samson C01U sounded much better (although it didn't any of the bells and whistles that the Yeti Pro did).

***REGRETTABLY, I GIVE THIS ONE A ""2""***

I'm still rooting for Blue to make improvements. It's great company with a great reputation.  Maybe I will repurchase this microphone if improvements are made.",0

NOPE! They sound like they are light strings. I cannot hear my low end, in-game, unless I tweak the -ish out of my amp and play through the ""neck"" selection on my pickup switch.

I play a 3x3 headstock and normally use 11-52 Medium gauge strings from Dean Markley.
These are for strat players and those who wanna play twang clean through. (no offense twangers. I can get down on the twang sometimes too.)

Pros:
Bright
Nice through amp on clean

Not really a medium gauge string.
Cant hear low strings in Rocksmith.
Take forever to break-in.

On a side note:
I feel as if DR would make the thicker strings sound better I would have been satisfied.
I also don't know if I have been spoiled with DM cryo's or what but these DR strings felt like I was sliding my fingers on some cheap steel.

If price is your only concern or you are a straight beginner, then RMS may suit you well. Or if you only need a practice amp in your house & aren't going to crank it, you'll probably be okay.

Any serious musician that needs an amp for gigs is not going to be happy with this amp.

On this particular model, the effects are very noisy, especially the chorus. This amp may as well not even have chorus because its not usable its so noisy. Its possible I got a bad one, but I doubt it because I've used RMS stuff before and am familiar with the quality. The reverb ain't so hot, either. Be prepared to turn the amp up pretty loud on the dial to get a reasonable volume.

LASTLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - there is no way this amp is truly 40 watts. It may be rated as such, but not in reality. Compare this to a 30W Roland and I guarantee the Roland is twice as loud, and clean.
This RMS amp is no more than 15W continuous output(i.e. RMS!). It's very generously rated at 40W and its highly misleading.

If you have a good amp for gigs, this might serve ok as an emergency one-time backup if you don't need really loud volumes or you plan to mic it. Other than that, leave it at home.

It does the job, but it is kind of flimsy feeling. It's very adjustable though, and this is probably why. It folds up to a very small package and I think because of that it's more difficult to have a very solid feel. However, the guitar is held up just fine. It feels a little tippy, but never threatens to fall over.  It's a nice unit, but because it feels a little loose the next stand I bought was welded all around and while it is not super fold-able, it feels much more solid.",0

Look pretty cool too but looks aren't what's getting it done. Overpriced in my opinion as are most fender cables. Not a huge fan and prefer lower profile pancake type patch cables mogami sounds better , easier to work with and the pedals can be kept much neater and closer to save space.

I'm sure the caps are garbage. There is going to be a limit to its life because of these 2 things. I'm going to take out the guts and put it in an aluminum housing if I can do it without destroying the thing. In the description, there is talk of bypass, but the plastic casing lends itself to static in the line and unbelievable noise frequencies.

It's inconsistent. Sometimes it activates quietly, and sometimes noisy. That has to be a footswitch issue.

It cost about as much as an action figure from Toys-R-Us which lends itself to the ""get what you pay for"" adage. I would never throw this on my pedal board for a show but can find some studio use for it I'm certain.

The tone of the wound, bass strings sounded dull ... like a set of regular round wounds after three gigs and they feel more like flat wounds than round wounds. Further, the tension is considerably higher than a normal round wound set of strings of the same gauge so, for those of you with floating tremolos, be prepared to tighten your claw and maybe be prepared to tighten your truss rod as well. These would  probably work well for jazz guitars but I'm more than a bit surprised at the use of word ""Rockers"" in the label. If you're looking for higher tension, warmth, and less string whistle, then these may be for you. If you're looking for that bright, new string ""spank"" go with standard round wounds.",0

1388,"Actually - 0 stars.

First let me say - I LOVE Dunlop's electric guitar strings. Fantastic products that last a long time, stay in tune, very durable, etc.

Sadly, this string set does not fit my 35"" scale 5 string, thru-body-only bridge (Traben Array Limited). More specifically, the taper is starts before the nut on the B, A and D strings - which means those strings buzz uncontrollably open or at the 1st fret. The E taper was just barely passable - it at least started at the nut, not before. Neither adjusting the truss nor saddles would help this - the strings are literally a millimeter too low at the nut because of the premature taper.

The first bad thing was that I had to go digging around for the length/scale on these strings - it's not printed anywhere on the specs here at Amazon or on Dunlop's website. I had to dig around in their FAQ section to find that these strings are wound to 37"" or 37.5"". So I ripped off my current A string (an MTD .80), marked and measured it - 36.75"" from ball to nut. I should have been good to go.

I pre-emailed Dunlop's customer service department to ask about their compatibility with my bass, but hadn't heard back. I needed strings, so I took the plunge. 5 days later, I haven't heard back from my original email. Now I have a support email out to see if they can help. Here's hoping they're more attentive after the sale (won't hold my breath).

So far, I've been burned by the supposed ""Super Long"" offerings by GHS, DR, EB and now my beloved Dunlop! Bass string mfr's - will you please get better at accurately publishing the length of your strings from ball to TAPER? This is frustrating for those of us who feel they have a great instrument, but can't get compatible accessories.",0

1392,"I spend 125+ nights a year in hotels, and wanted a ukulele I could take with me without upsetting my much practiced road warrior packing system.  I played the concert-sized travel Kala uke at my local music store (they didn't have the soprano in stock), and loved the action and the tone.  Easy to play, sweet sound.  I put the uke into its nice gig bag, took it out to the car, and tried to fit it into my 25"" suitcase.  It would just barely go diagonally corner to corner, tight to the point that I was concerned that a sharp blow to the end of the suitcase might damage the uke.  So I went back in and ordered the soprano.  Waited a few weeks, went back to the store, they said it was back-ordered for at least another month, so canceled that order, and bought one online.

The soprano showed up, and I was almost immediately disappointed.  One of the zippers on the cool looking gig bag would not operate.  Took the uke out, tuned it, and started playing.  Within minutes it was wildly flat, particular the E string.  And the instrument's tone was just too harsh, not at all mellow like the concert version I had played earlier.  I continued to noodle around on it for the next two weeks.  Everytime I picked it up, the same problem -- way way out of tune.

Now I own two other ukes (both Gretcsh solid-bodies) and I understand that the strings have to ""settle""; that initially you have to keep tuning until they are properly stretched.  But the Kala was ridiculous.  I couldn't get through a two-minute song without it going flat.  In contrast my Gretsch tenor will stay in tune for days, even weeks at a time.

Nonetheless I took the uke along on a trip.  It fit easily in my suitcase, and seemed quite safe and secure in its well-padded bag placed among the packing cubes I use to organize my stuff.  It was great being able to pull it out at night and practice in the hotel, but OMG, I was tuning it 15 times an hour (and I have crappy sense of pitch so it takes awhile for me to realize when it goes flat).  And even in tune the tone somehow was just not right, too brassy, too harsh.

Yet there were a lot of good things about the Kala, as other reviewers have noted.  It was well made and well finished.  I liked the balance and the look.  It had nice tuners, nice binding and inlays.  The Kala had good sustain and remarkable projection for an instrument this size.  I just really wanted to love it, but couldn't.  Sent it back to the online retailer and returned to dragging around my Gretcsch in its hard case when I travel.

Given my positive experience with the concert Kala travel uke, and the largely glowing reviews of the instrument on this site and elsewhere, it's possible I just got a dud, or bad strings, or something.  And perhaps the issues could have been addressed had I bought it locally (as I prefer to do) so the guys at the music shop could work on the set up.  I'll go by there again and see if they have one in stock I can play, and talk to them about the issues I experienced.  I don't rule out buying another one, but only locally this time.",0

I thought the nylon strings would be better for tiny tender fingers, but they are so dull and muted. The thing sounds like a ukulele with a sinus infection. If you have a young one sincerely wanting to pursue music - look on ebay or craigslist for a real guitar, even if used. A little more money would have gone a long way towards a better music learning experience.  I will say as a positive though, the sizing was nice for my daughters small frame. Her fingers could reach the different frets and the guitar waist sat well on her legs. But, it didn't make much difference with the rest of it being shoddy.",0

2. AUX input: If you are not a guitar player and your only option for accompanied music is pipe it through aux port.  It seems like 1/8"" headphone type plug.  In my unit it simply did not work.  Upon further research, I found on their forum that Aux input is mono.  So, I have to split you MP3 stereo output into mono and plug it into the unit.

1413,"I play 5-string basses with active (MusicMan) and passive (Tune pickups with a custom passive circuit) electronics.  I also track with an American Standard Strat and a Japanese Tele with a Bigsby.

I can only say that it is a quiet cable.  Working with an established engineer (with recording credits on international releases going back to the 1980s, I received a quite audible complaint about the body of my bass.  ""You put ukulele strings on that thing?""

I have this and another cable by Mogami.  The Mogami is a very sterile cable but, in its sterility, also sucks some of the impact and low end, it seems like it is attenuating it intentionally!  While not as bad as the ""silver"" line, still unacceptable when compared to my other studio cables.  I reverted to my Carver-made ""ProTone"" cable marketed by Fender.  A very flat cable that one can hear the difference in the most subtle of things.

When doing guitar tracks, I tried to go back to the Mogami (thinking that, during rehearsals, I liked the sound in the hall) and the same complaint.  I ended up tracking with the ProTone for guitar too.

Bottom line, if you're not shrill and don't have anything but 12th fret shred, I think you'd do better with another company.

This was a $1300 Carvin guitar, so it wasn't a cheap guitar. On the acoustic guitars, when placed on the very end of the head (between the D and G strings) it worked okay if there was minimal noise in the room.

The whole purpose of these style tuners, for me, is to be able to tune while other people are playing. This tuner seems to pick up a lot of noise rather than focusing on vibration. If you are playing by yourself on an acoustic instrument, this tuner will work. For all other scenarios, I would recommend spending more and buying a nicer tuner because I have had a couple of clip on tuners that work better than this one.",0

I bought a few of these to use in a church environment and things get abused more than I'd like, so far they have held up!

It isn't a bad connection or a loose wire, it's just that some component on this thing's circuit card pooped out.  I have never in all my years of music and video production had a mic die this way.  Shame on Audio Technica for putting this piece of junk on the market.  BTW, I have another AT mic that I've had since 1981 and it still works.  My how times have changed.

Now I had two tracking numbers and one of them was still the eBay item number. Fed Ex told me they have no recordof either numbers that Crescent gave me. So I did some online hunting. I found out most had problems with shipping. The company would say the product is out of their hands and the shipping company is not responsible for the package. People were lied to about shipping dates, received broken items. And if people on eBay gave a negative feedback on the company, Crescent would hold their refund till they removed the negative feedback. Right now it's been 4 days and still have a bogus tracking number and Fed Ex doesn't know what I'm talking about when I ask about my package. So now PayPal is involved.

1445,"I own three ""Gator"" brand guitar cases, and they're top notch, so given this, along with the numerous positive reviews, I decided to order their guitar stand. I guess I just happpened to receive an inferior one. After assembling the stand, I proceeded to gently tighten the plastic knob that secures the two primary pieces together, and the small square rivet just popped out of the tube. Since it would probably cost too much to return, I opted to try and fix it myself using some Gorilla duct tape. A little unsightly, but that's ok as long as it worked. It didn't. Gravity, plus the weight of both guitars caused the two shafts to twist enough so that the only thing that kept them from crashing onto my hardwood floor (one being a hollow-body), was the rubber straps that secured the necks. I about passed out upon seeing two of my treasured guitars hanging lopsided like that. Yeah, I know. I should have known better... It's really a shame though, because the stand seemed to be made pretty well, other than the rivet. I own five other stands, and this was my first double, so my attempt to free up some much needed floor space didn't work out too well. Oh well, live and learn....It might make a good, albeit a funky looking tomato stake ",0

Just recently I noticed  I could start to feel the fret wires stick out on the tenor, this is a sure sign of wood shrinkage. So I put 2 pieces of damp sponge (each piece about 1""x2"") in the case by the neck and that got the humidity up to 80%. After a day, the neck started to swell again and the wires felt more normal. The point is: 2 oasis humidifiers for 1 uke could not bring up the humidity to normal range, 35% to 55%! Absolutely useless, could not even come close to the effectiveness of an ordinary household sponge! Give me a break Oasis, you charge $20 each for this junk? A ripoff as far as I'm concerned.",0

If you remove this insert, the shaft opening will be about 3/8"", which is too big for a  .25 inch pot shaft. In addition, the set screw does not penetrate through the plastic, and will stop turning before it enters the shaft tunnel even with the insert removed, so the set screw is essentially worthless.

I had to drill out the plastic inserts to accommodate a .25 inch pot shaft in order for these to work. These represent a pretty thoughtless design to me.

1455,"The blurb says this power supply has isolated power outlets - it doesn't. All power outlets ground to the same buss which can cause noise (if ONE pedal decides to be noisy - ALL the pedals using this power supply are noisy).

I'm kind of pissed that it's misrepresented as an isolated power supply, but I guess live and learn.

On the bright side (the reason I gave it two stars instead of one), if the right pedals are used, it DOES provide the power needed to make them go and doesn't bridge too much noise through the circuit (I'm running TWO noise filters on my pedalboard and if this supply powers the wrong pedals - even the 'silencers' can't make that circuit quiet).

1465,"When these monitors arrived I set them up straight away and was instantly greeted by the infamous hum that they are known for. In a quiet studio, set up for near field monitoring, the noise quickly becomes very annoying. I am frankly amazed that these monitors went into mass production with this flaw.

Used as home stereo speakers, with the background noise levels typically found in your average lounge and at the distance used for casual listening, these things will perform great. But when they are only a couple of feet from your ears, every time you stop playback for an edit, the hum will make you want to pack them up and send them straight back to where you got them. It's a real pitty, because during playback, they do sound pretty good, if not just a little over powering in the bass.

From my investigations into this issue, the problem is not due to ground loops or poor grounding, it is simply that the power transformer employs no magnetic shielding and is close enough to the amplifier for the EMF to radiate into the audio path. A torroidal transformer or better magnetic shielding would have avoided this problem - why M-Audio chose not to employ either of these is completely beyond me.

Ultimately, the poor powersupply design relegates these speakers to a consumer-grade item. They are not up to studio use.

EDIT:
So, I have persisted with these monitors and like them even less after a couple of weeks.  In addition to the previously mentioned buzz, they are very aggresive in the upper mids which makes them extremly fatiguing to listen to for more than a few minutes at a time.  I simply cannot enjoy anything recorded in the last decade on them because they sound so hyped.  As international shipping on these was so expensive, sending them back is not really an option. So, I will look to sell them locally and buy something I can live with.  I guess this is the risk you take buying over the internet when all the reviews are positive.  In 20 years of recording, these are one of the few purchases I regret.",0

However, within less than an hour of having it installed on my guitar, I broke it because there was nothing to support the pickup where the cable plugged in on the guitar. I'm not a klutzy person, but just moving the guitar around with the cable hooked up to the pickup puts a lot of strain on the pickup and if you're not careful, it will snap like a Popsicle stick.

I will give it good marks on sound, however. The little bit of time that I actually got to use it, it sounded very good.

The biggest negative is the design of the pickup itself. When installed on the bridge of the guitar, the part that houses the jack for the cable to plug into is completely unsupported. I found it extremely easy to break with the cord attached.",0

1486,"I'm not a novice. My gigging guitar is a Taylor 816ce, which is the guitar I purchased this for and what I'm writing about. If you squeeze to open the capo all the way (as if you're in a hurry and just want to make sure it's open) and then push it all the way onto the neck until it bottoms out (again, to make sure it's seated quickly) it's possible / very likely that the EDGE of the padding (a surface of hard rubber about 1/16 inch x 1/2 inch) will catch on the neck binding (edge of the neck) and the capo won't close all the way. This leaves the two bass strings open and puts a lot of pressure on the very small edge of the pad on your binding. Not terrible if you have a plastic binding but the binding on my 816 is maple, which could be prone to damage under this kind of pressure. Not cool.

This is a fatal design flaw. When playing live I don't have 5 seconds between songs to finesse a capo or inspect it carefully to make sure it's seated properly. These are supposed to be ""squeeze and go."" I have absolutely no idea where the positive reviews come from. A Taylor 816 is basically the quintessential acoustic guitar.

Well the next day I noticed my left speaker seemed to be leaning a little bit.

I was able to catch my speaker before it hit anything, but that was the last straw for me. I packaged these stands back up and sent them back. Awful experience.

Also, the various controls did nothing to modulate my sound. In the video, which I realize is pretty dark, I turn the sustain all the way up, then all the way down....no effect. The fast - slow switch does nothing. I was hoping for a swoosh to my rhythm guitar attack. Maybe I did something wrong, but you can only hook these up in one way.

A couple of times it powered up almost normally and worked for a minute, but then the sound dies and the LEDs start flashing again. No helpful information in the manual, or on Behringer's web site. I contacted support and it was just out of warranty, so they wouldn't help at all. Their best solution was to pay myself to ship it to a California to a paid service center and back again. Obviously that would cost more than a new unit, so it's kind of pointless. I would have even been happy if they would have told me something like, ""the flashing LEDs indicate a power supply failure"" or something like that to help in the repair, but they offered no help whatsoever.

1535,"I should have known better. I have been playing diatonics for over 50 years. I have owned mostly Hohners, from the cheap, childhood instruments I learned on to Special 20s, and a Hohner Blues Harp that I have had for decades and still plays dependably, probably because it was my ""car harp"" and only got played at the occasional traffic light.

After retirement, I decided I could be a bit extravagant. I purchased the Suzuki SCX-64C because of the reviews, the reputation, and the comments in several reviews on the mouthpiece.

Mechanically, it has been great, but musically, it has been horrible. All low notes respond at their preferred pressure, and each seems to require its own particular pressure; the upper notes require increasing pressure, with the highest requiring extreme pressure. Worse, many of the low reeds fail with the least attempt at volume, while others seem fully responsive over a wide dynamic range.

In brief, it is an inexcusably uneven instrument with numerous defective reeds that I foolishly tolerated trusting that it was my ineptness rather than the instrument. After numerous attempts to get this thing to play, I'm convinced it is the instrument.

Not sure what I'm going to do with this overpriced piece of junk, if I can't find an instrument repair shop that can even it out a bit.

My recommendation would be to skip Amazon and buy locally. Had I done so, I could have established a trail of complaints and likely gotten some resolution long ago.

I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.

I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..

UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box.

1548,I couldn't get a sound I liked from them. maybe good for a foot box or something,0
1549,"OK first of all,  I didn't simply give up when I plugged the unit in and set it next to a speaker.  I was attempting to control the sound and the chase settings.  The directions say the ""chase knob"" allows me to select the chase.  Turning it all all the way clockwise sets it randomly go through all 17 chase designs.  However, the user manual gives no direction to explain what the different chase designs are AND the unit does NOT have a 1,2,3,4,5,6 and so on to indicate what its set for.

Secondly, the unit has a ""sound"" knob.  This was deemed to me as useless because no matter how the knob was turned, clockwise, counter clock wise, 1/2 way, 1/4 way, etc, I could not see any control from one chase design to another that was ""beat-driven"".  It was ""globally random.""  The unit again has no 1,2,3,4,5,6, etc markings on the sound either and the enclosed ""directions"" are useless.  Also, in order to daisy chain the power from one unit to another, you will need to supply yourself with an IEC male to IEC female power cable which is NOT ADVERTISED, EXPLAINED, PICTURED OR ENCLOSED.  I found this out the hard way - when it was delivered.  The only power cable included is a standard IEC female to standard Male grounded end.  That's great for powering up, but NOT to daisy chain.

Thirdly, there is a ""speed"" knob.  The directions say to turn the knob all the way counter-clockwise to use the unit for chase mode... And again, just using the speed knob was just more of the random blinking to the point it looked like a strobe light out of control.

If you're looking for low cost, easy to set up/strike LED lighting unit that is bright, light weight, very portable and dmx-free, the Chauvet led dj bank is your answer.  Anyone want to buy my ADJ color bursts (and i'll include that daisy chain cord as well... let me know.",0

I tried as many different options and variations possible, just short of buying a new computer, but nothing could get rid of the static.  I really wanted to like this mic--even giving the benefit of the doubt with how cheaply it's priced--but it's simple way too staticy.

- Lots of static (listen to video). I am fairly certain it's the phantom power because, as you see in the video, as I turn it off the phantom power slowly loses juice... the static goes away. Then after working beautifully for just a few seconds, with no static at all, them mic runs 100% out of power.
- Records too low into my MacBook Pro audio jack. I read reviews where it works well in PCs, so maybe it's just Apple users.
- Love the heaviness--feels really high quality compared to other mics I've tried on Amazon.

Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration, which of course has no bearing on the honesty of my opinions regarding the product. Hope demonstration and test helps!

 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?
No.  However depending on your use--if you're recording over already staticy games, maybe this will suffice. If you're a videographer as well, or looking for decent voiceover quality, I'd recommend something that allow you to build a solid portfolio. (while yes, these options are more expensive, if you land just one VO gig with these, it essentially pays itself off)

1555,"After hearing a lot about how Elixirs stay alive for longer than other strings and potentially save me money, I decided to give it a shot and bought a set.

For starters, the A string snapped on me with barely any tension on it. Yes, the A string, not the G that tends to snap in a lot of string sets, but a relatively heavy A.
I got a replacement for that (also an Elixir, as I prefer all strings to stay same-set).

But then I found that they all sound relatively dull and lifeless out of the box. Well, I thought maybe I need to wait for them to settle in, but time really did not help with it. The strings lack a lot of sustain and volume, especially on the bass. Treble is... eh, it's okay at best.

Overall, a huge disappointment, especially for the price. About the only good thing I can say about them is... umm... I guess they bend fairly easily? Never buying Elixirs for my guitar again. Pretty much every other make rolls out better strings.",0

1560,"I have had Maschine for 4 years.

I have owned an MV8800, and currently own an MC808 so fully understand samplers, grooveboxes and sequencers. I also own several hardware synthesizers, and run a powerful PC & DAW in my small scale recording studio.

This is simply not a good product. I can only conclude that for NI, the purpose of Maschine is to drive sales of sample (expansion) packs and Komplete, as for sure the capabilities of Maschine in its own right are sub standard.

The Sequencer
The sequencer is VERY weak, lacking features found on pretty much every hardware sequencer the last 15 years, and its capabilities as software are easily surpassed by free/donationware midi sequencers. As a sequencer it would be a joke, but its not funny. Any MPC, MC, MV, SY and synth workstation has sequencing abilities that FAR surpass this.

The Sampler
1. You cannot record audio tracks. period. Any linear recording must be done as a sample. This means you need a sequenced event to start sample playback to initiate your recorded ""track""
2. The sampler is just OK. It is not flexible.. for example, if you are desiring a fluid workflow, it would be nice if you can (as it allows you to) set up the sample playback mode prior to recording. It then of course, changes to its default mode as soon as you hit record. You cannot change the default mode, and this mode has changed over software versions.

As VST host
Good luck using non NI VST plugins. most will load, but good luck finding presets, or saving presets.

Inadequate routing, poor/frustrating integration with a DAW environment (Maschine as a VST), and a clear focus on sound packs vs functionality means this is not a good purchase.. used prices reflect this.

On the + side, you do get a lot of kits and content, and Maschine is a decent midi controller so has dual use.

Summary
Its like hanging out with an 8 year old... its fun for a while, but sooner or later you want adult company.

BUY if
a) You are new to music production, and want ONE entire ITB item.
b) You have simple needs of groove/rhythm production
c) If you are seeking a lot of drum content and need inspiration on grooves/rhythms.

DON'T BUY if
a) You think that Maschine will short circuit the need for a DAW. It wont. You will still need to learn Live, Logic, Sonar etc.
b) You have any hardware gear .. its painful.
c) You have a DAW and think that using Maschine standalone will be quicker and easier. It wont. Learn your DAW instead.",0

If TC Helicon added some rubber bumpers around all corners, re-designed the mic stand connector, added a handle (for carrying without a custom gig box) and dropped the price, you'd have a real bargain for the feature set.

Pros:

- Wide and strong frame blocks the light from the audience.

- Standard music folder fits on music shelf with this light attached.

- Accepts a wide variety of incandescent bulbs, such as tubular showcase bulbs from 20 to 60 watts, or the small-bodied compact florescent bulbs such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feit-Electric-ESL13T-D-13-Watt-Compact-Fluorescent-Mini-Twist-Bulb-60-Watt-Incandescent-Equivalent-Daylight/dp/B000LWMSG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feit Electric ESL13T/D 13-Watt Compact Fluorescent Mini Twist Bulb (60-Watt Incandescent Equivalent), Daylight</a>.

- Not expensive.

Cons:

- This lamp is not adjustable in any way, and the factory-set angle is inexplicably aimed at the upper part of the music shelf .  Using a 60-watt tube light helps, but the bottom part of the music still isn't well lit.  I got stuck using this lamp on a gig once, and wound up bending the lamp's sheet metal frame by hand to redirect more light onto the lower half of the music.  If you don't mind bending your own lamp, the light will then be OK.

- It doesn't fold, so it takes up too much space in a gig bag - assuming you carry it with you.

- Only fits metal stands without a rolled steel top, such as the Manhasset.  So, if you take it with you to a gig that has non-Manhasset-type stands, it won't fit.

Summary:

Manhasset should make this product with an adjustable lamp angle.  At the very least, the light should be redirected to the middle of the music shelf.",0

1580,"Too basic. Only 12 frets. This is for people that have NEVER played guitar and basically know nothing about playing a guitar other than what one looks like. You can use an electronic tuner and learn what's on these faster and easier. A typical guitar, if full scale, has at least 21 frets. This may help learn a few Barre chords at best. I was not impressed with this at all. And I wouldn't recommend it. Buy a good Intellitouch PT10 Tuner and you can learn every note on the guitar. Or an Artisan Tuner that easily allows for off tuning as well. You can set the timing signature with either. Many better options than this.",0
1581,"I had problems keeping the height locked into one position. It intermittently drops down while your sitting on it, which is never fun while you're drumming. Then when you raise it, it won't stay up. It can drive you crazy. I complained and Gibraltar was nice enough to send me another stand. But after a little while, the same problem started to occur. It just will not stay up. You have to keep playing with it until you want to take it and throw it very far. The handle comes off easily also. Please save yourself a headache and buy a non-hydraulic throne. I weigh 165 lbs. and so far I'm 0 for 2. If I weighed 300 lbs, maybe I could see a reason, but there is obviously a design flaw within the hydraulic portion.

If you turn it one way it's Monitoring, and you turn it the other it's Mixing. Little did I know, if you put it in the middle you could do both. It was a real pain in my crack, but once I got that figured out, it was usable. The other thing is recording direct guitar can be a nightmare, the signal was always to hot. I found out that I have to back off the volume on my guitar, and turn down the Main channel volume on the Interface, to make the signal work. I record direct, so I like to use Amplitude for my effects, and even with a good PC, and the setting set to low latancy, I still have some while using distortion and luckily I haven't had anything that I needed real precise, or it wouldn't happen. I'd love to record with my guitar turned up, because I love to back off for various tones, but it's hard with my volume down so far.

The frets look like someone put them in with a hammer, because all of them are different heights which makes it hard to play.

Have tried to run it to an amp and mic it. Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device, and the result is always the same: a god-awful, horrible-sounding muddy tone that cannot be helped with all the EQ in the world. It is not good for metal, or any other genre for that matter. I realize it is probably not meant to record with, but i feel that anybody who is searching for a good studio guitar tone should certainly look elsewhere. If you have a combo amp, the distortion on it is probably way better than you will get with this pedal. BOSS makes some great products, but this is definitely not one of them.",0

1628,"When a product's rating on Amazon is substantially different from my own rating, it is usually an indication of one or more of the following:
- Other ratings are superficial and nobody has taken the time to write an in-depth review
- I am using the product in a very different way and see things that other's don't
- There are fake or bought reviews

I can't tell which of the above applies here. Maybe there is a fourth reason. Either way, the American Dj Vertigo does not impress me. I purchased it to make a family event a bit more interesting. I tested the light at home in my living room, and I deployed it at a venue large enough to hold 200 people. I wouldn't purchase this light again for either scenario. At home, the individual light spots, when projected on the walls and ceiling, have the same hourglass shape as the openings on the fixture. This looks a bit cheesy.

At the event hall, I would have needed 5 of these lights to make an impression. I do like the way it responds to the music, but as others have noted, it needs to be close to the speakers and the volume has to be relatively high, definitely beyond the point where people can have conversations. Because of this, I do not recommend this light for an outdoor party. It is limited to the use on a small dance floor.

And lastly, the fact that it cannot be remote-controlled (other than synchronized with another ADJ light that supports this) or programmed makes this light a dead-end for the aspiring DJ who wants to start out small, but add on to his or her equipment over time. This will have to be replaced as you start getting into DMX lighting.

So, in conclusion, for $80 you get an effect light that is better than a $20 laser pointer with different patterns, but cannot compete in the realm of DJ effect lights for the ambitious amateur or professional.",0
1629,"A weld broke on the second gig! It was holding an 88 weighted key Korg Triton Studio when it broke and fortunately I was at the keyboard to catch it during this catastrophic failure. There was no way to make the stand still useable. We were fortunate to find a table at the venue. Unfortunately the stand broke about a week after the Amazon return window closed.

The stand made the keyboard sit about an inch higher than I would have preferred. As other reviewers have mentioned, the stand does sway significantly side to side when the keyboard is on the stand. But I didn't expect it to break! Especially after so very little use.

The weld that broke is on the horizontal bar of the legs where the locking bar attaches to that lowest connecting bar. When looking at it closer the weld was small and all of the metal used on the legs looks a little thin and weak.

When extending the stand to full width the center rails dip a little. This stand clearly isn't designed to support a full size keyboard. There is no way this stand can hold up to the rigors of frequent gigging.

I'm a guitar teacher who often has to tune student guitars in the midst of alot of noise and thus thought this would make things quicker and more accurate. (I discovered the little tuner from one of my students who had one, and it seemed fairly good.)

Well, first off, I noticed it seemed to have problems the second time I used it. The screen was darker than I remembered the first time.. but maybe it was just me. The next time I tried to use it, it just wouldn't come on. (Dead battery after 3 weeks and a handful of uses? So, I now need to go look for a battery, that'll probably cost more than the tuner.... AND... I'll have to go through the complicated process of opening the back to get to the battery. hmmm....) Then I read the reviews...

Most were good, but the one's that weren't expressed the same issues I was experiencing. The best part: after only using the thing two or three times, my ability to return it has expired.... it figures... It's okay... fortunately it was only a few bucks.

1638,"The build on this thing is phenomenal. It's sexy. It's sturdy. It has all the right connections and the price point was great.

Unfortunately, the drivers SUCK.

On Windows 8.1, I simply cannot use it. In my primary DAW, Ableton Live, it crackles CONSTANTLY. I own several audio interfaces, some cheaper, one on-board, and some more expensive. Unfortunately this is the only one that fails to work well with Windows 8 with the latest drivers installed. I also **could not believe** that a modern product like this was completely USB 3.0 incompatible, but I'm learning that's more commonplace than I'd like with audio devices in the lower price bracket. I did, however, install a PCI-Express USB 2.0 card explicitly to interface with this device, and it didn't perform any better than when plugged into a USB 2.0 hub. Please note that if you, like myself, have only USB 3.0 slots, you will need a hub or an extra card to even communicate with this device.

You'll probably get great mileage out of it on Windows 7 or with a Mac. I really like the unit; I just hate the drivers. Given how long it's been on the market, I can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. I'm confident that's the issue after extensive research on the matter (and a lifetime of experience in the computer industry).

1646,"First off the box was destroyed when it arrived.  It had been previously opened.  The ring that was supposed to be in the locking pin for the seat was found floating around in the bottom of the box and was almost completely straight.  In other words, someone had used it and pulled it too hard and it's a cheap wire and it was pulled out of shape.  The directions for assembly are horrible and looking at the pictures is the best way to assemble.  It's really not fully portable as described.  Someone had a good idea for this type of stool, but the execution of the product is poorly done and it really is not comfortable to sit on.  You cannot get the back to position correctly for comfort.  To collapse the stool you really need to take the back completely off.  The back is a pain as instead of it being a pin lock type system as the seat is, this thing fully screws in with a plastic knob screw.

Me thinks it needs to be re-engineered to make this a decent product.  Decided for the price ~$125.00 it was too expensive to keep as it really is not comfortable for a guitar player to use.  A regular bar stool with back rest and foot rest works just as well.  If you have the room in your vehicle, the bar stool doesn't really take up that much more room then this product when taken apart.

Very disappointing.",0
1647,"I don't know who designs the strap loop placement at Stagg, but if you ever read this: you are terrible at your job. The loops are along an axis of symmetry through the bag, so if you have big cymbals the bag is thoroughly unstable when lifting with the shoulder strap. Seriously, it is not hard to put a cymbal in this bag during the design stage and lift it even one time. Additionally, the liner on one side of the bag is not sewn in, so it kinda just flops around, but that's not really a big deal. Other than that this bag is great, excellent padding, lots of compartments.

1649,"I got this a few weeks ago.  I messed around with it long enough to know I don't have a regular need for it.  It sounded cool in an experimental kind of way, and I may find a use for it some day, but seemed to create noise at the lower frequency notes (...and that could just be my amp) and produced a lot of sounds (at various settings) that I thought were terrible.  As for the effect itself, I just found it hard to use it in a predictable way.  It was fun to play around with but every time I've tried to work with it, I find myself shutting it off to get to the sound I am going for.  I knew it would sound electronic, that's it's key trait, but just found it making things sound muddy, especially with the fuzz setting.  I don't like it's distortion feature at all.  I will continue to play around and figure out if I have a use for it but it will take a lot of effort on my part.  Not the kind of pedal that ""out-of-the-box"" blows you away, but not a terrible thing to have either if you have a niche use for this kind of sound.",0
1650,"I had the Scarlett 2i4 before I got to this one(6i6). But I returned the 2i4 due to a issue with the Line Outs being noisey and got this one because it had a dedicated power out vs powered via USB and so far I like the flexibility of this interface, but the annoying thing I had to learn though 1-2 hours of text support is that the Line In 3/4 on the back of the interface will not work with third party programs like OBS, Skype, Discord, Teamspeak, ETC but the Line In 3/4 on the Komplete Audio 6 interface works with those programs from what I have seen. Another con I have noticed is that every couple of hours, my voice would go robotic though MME and I would have to go into Device Manager and restart the Scarlett 6i6 in Focusrite Audio so the issue would be resolved. But I noticed that I never had any sort of roboty voice with direct ASIO interaction via Adobe Audition while MME would present those issues. Overall the 6i6 2nd gen is a nice interface but I hope Focusrite can fix those issues because I rarely had a robotic voice with my previous interface (Line 6 UX2) on MME. EDIT (6/16/17): I wanted to add this to the review a few months ago but I forgot. So back in the end of January, I ended up returning this and taking the plunge on the Steinberg UR44 interface and their drivers are 10x more stable then Focusrite's. The line inputs are a little too hot for my tastes but it is not a issue for mic-level signals. For those that are having driver problems, I would recommend the Steinberg interfaces as their drivers are 98% stable on Windows 10 Creators Update and the build quality is great. If you are not having the same driver problems or you are using the interface solely for ASIO, then I guess you guys could keep it. But since I solely use MME and like to set-and-forget it, this interface is not for me.",0
1651,"I have owned my GT-R1 for about a year... As other's have mentioned, months after owning it, the input jack for a guitar (or bass) started developing problems. I was able to twist the cord in a way to make it work, but that soon ended, making the recorder impossible to record into through the input jack. Soon after that the volume control stopped working for recording... It would go down, but once down, would not go up... The record function through the built in mics still works, but now you are unable to hear what you recorded, because it only records at the lowest level possible, which is inaudible. Making my GT-R1 totally useless and garbage...

I love all the features, but it took a long while to feel comfortable with them.

Obviously the input jack is a design flaw, so I would not recommend buying this product unless Tascam designs an input jack that works and lasts more then a few plug-ins... It is made from cheap plastic.

I have not seen the volume control problem mentioned in other reviews, so it might just be mine, but this now makes my GT-R1 more cheap Chinese plastic garbage for the landfill...

1652,"Great recorder if you use a stand or external mic or line inputs when recording.  Handling noise prohibits handheld use with the onboard mikes.  Battery life is about 10 hours total record plus standby with fully charged LiO main and self-contained AA aux batteries, unlike the Sony PCM-M10, which gives you over 24 hrs of record time on 2 AA batts, but doesn't have XLR's or phantom power for mics. The built-in mics on the DR-100mkII will pop if you are recording talent voices less than 3' away.  You definitely don't want to drop this unit, unless you buy them by the dozen.

That being said, this unit faithfully lives up to its specs, with no surprises, and has the ability to include the date (but not the time) in the sequential auto-naming function, which helps sort files. The ""Browsing"" function shows the date, time and other recording parameters for each file.

Summation: This is a professional recorder with many bells and whistles, and may not be the best choice for someone who does not need to make ""masters.""

***** UPDATE, Jan 25, 2013 *****  While recording a consultation with a patient, I hit the ""MARK"" button at a very important part while taking her medical history over the phone.  A few minutes later, during another important part, I looked down ready to press the MARK button again, only to find that this *#$$!)^# recorder had paused itself with the record light flashing, and was displaying an error message which said something about the MARK failed b/c it timed out.  Nothing I did could get this thing back into record mode, even though the record button was blinking.  The thing had to be shut down, then powered back up, and only then could you start recording again.

This is a serious flaw if you do something live.  I not only use this for production, I wanted to give it a ""real world"" test in the office - which it flunked.  In case you're wondering, I used the SD card that came with the recorder.  I dropped it from a 5 star rating down to 2, and will probably send it back.

1677,"I've purchased several of this same bow from Vio Music a few years ago, and I'm sorry to say their quality control has gone downhill.

This time I bought two more. One of the bow buttons was very hard to turn. But, that wasn't the worst of it. One of the biggest problems
with cheap bows is how the horsehair is fitted, and the quality of the bow, so that when you do tighten the bow to proper tension of the horsehair to be able to play, the stick is almost straight, not curved.

Both of these bows were like that and I had to send them back. A very big disappointment. I will never buy another Vio Music bow.
By the way, the list price of $185 is a joke. Even if these bows were playable, they really are worth no more than $25. And, as another reviewer said, it may not even be Pernambuco. The ones I got were very light colored wood, like my Brazilwood bows. Pernambuco is dark reddish brown, if it's a good bow.

1684,"Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it ""rarely"" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.

Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.

1688,"I've been gigging for about 15 years now and this seems like the industry standard at clubs and bars when the sound man comes to start helping you setup everything.

Most of them are beat to hell but they work.  That's about the best thing I can say about the Beta 58.  It can take a beating and probably not fail.  The sound quality will suffer as several beat up Beta 58's I've used sounded like there was a rag wrapped around the mic but it got the job done in a pinch.

As I started working with other vocalists who brought their own mics to shows, I noticed that none of them really used the beta 58.  Most of them preferred either the EV ND767a, the Sennheiser e935a or the Sure Beta 87a.  The differences between these mics and the ""house 58's"" was astonishing... even 58's in very good condition (never been dropped or abused) did not sound as clear as the EV/SENN's.

The biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors.  The Senn and EV both have much better feedback rejection than any of the 58's I've seen.

All in all, I've been pretty underwhelmed with the 58.  For around the same price there are much better choices.

I know that different venues, singers, PA setups, different stage monitors, etc all can affect how a mic performs but my observations are based on hearing pretty much the same traits over and over so they are not based on isolated incidents and I also base this all on the performance of new or like new 58's, not the beat up ones.",0

1697,"Watched the promotional/instructional video of this item, which made it look so easy to change the nut, then purchased two of this item to fit Fender guitars I have.  I found his item is extremely difficult to get to fit Fender guitars, requiring HOURS of sanding because the existing nut slots are MUCH thinner than this nut with the fret wire, and then the fret wire requires force to get it to conform to the radius of the slot.  Long story short, it was lucky I purchased two nuts, as after I got the first one sanded and the fretwire fitted into the slot, put the strings and tuned to make sure there was no fret buzz, then removed strings and nut to get ready to glue into place and finish, I found the nut broken in two places below the string slots.  Once you have to sand the back of the nut until it fits, the already thin nut becomes extremely thin and prone to break!  Luckily I had the other plastic nut which I then carefully sanded and got installed without breaking, but am now not able to do the other guitar I purchased the second nut for.  I went to the manufactures website and sent them an email requesting I be able to purchase another nut to replace the broken one, or maybe TWO just in case it broke again, but have not heard a word back in now 7 days!  Because of the small ledge built in to the nut, the fretwire sets on, which has to be formed to not only fit in to the nut slot, but also needs to be sanded down enough to be level with the fretboard, and the thinness of the plastic nut to start, the sanding process makes this nut MUCH thinner, and extremely fragile and easily broken.  For the price of this item, it should include two of the plastic nuts, in case one of them breaks.  I am extremely unhappy that I spent $50 to re-nut ONE fender guitar.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY, AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!",0
1698,"I need to clarify my review.
Amazon have 5 stars and A+ in the way they managed my situation.
Behringer have a big 0 and F+ for not taking care of they quality control.
In December 2016 I bought one of these little amps that I keep at my older son's house in Orlando, Florida. I played that thing in 5 or 6 Christmas parties going for 5 to 6 hours on continuous playing and singing. It managed like a champ at volume knob set at 5. Clear beautiful sound on my guitar and microphone. Every body was impressed. So I decided to buy one for my small gigs with family and friends down here in Puerto Rico.
The first one was delayed and the tracking number was changed so no tracking was possible for it. Then I ordered a replacement. Both of them arrived. I tried the first one and the sound was really bad. No way to set it up to get what the one in Orlando produced. Sounded like a blown speaker. So, I tried the second one and to my surprise it sound worst than the first one. I invited some musicians friend that brought their guitars and microphones just to make sure that the amps were the problem. They went in love with the size and high volume they produce but the sound continued to be really bad in both amps.
I wrote to Amazon customer service and they guided me to the return process and took care of freight charges for the return and refunded me for the cost of the original order. I am very satisfied with Amazon customer service. They really make you feel sure about ordering from Amazon. But Behringer should be more careful about their products quality control. It is no fun to make a return just because the manufacturer do not care. Thanks Amazon for your great customer service. Ramon Diaz",0

You can plug your guitar straight into and get a fat sound for recording but this is more of a novelty.  For vocals, it's not that great!  Again, it is dull and bassy sounding.

My uncertainty is why I am giving both products two stars.

I am unlikely to purchase another Behringer product, even though others have had some good reviews and will probably go with one of the competition.

I must say that Amazon accepted the return without question and refunded my money. I don't often return products, but when I do I'm pleased with this company's attitude.

1718,"I just purchased 2 sets and installed one of the sets on my guitar. After only 20 minutes of playing the high E string is flaking down by the pickups.  There is approximately 3"" of no coating remaining. The packaging states during testing your coating has not peeled, or stripped away ever. The is obviously something wrong with at least this installed set.

The colors do match Rocksmith and aid in finding the right string while learning the songs. The majority of the remainder of the string has remained fine after about 3 hours of constant playing. I read the reviews of others saying the color will flake, but the current packaging states that they have ""developed a K3 technology where the coating lasts up to 9 times longer (by factory test) than previous DR color coatings supplied by and outside source."" By my actual real world testing, it will flake and peel after 20 minutes. I guess this means that the original coating only lasted 1 1/2 minutes?

I also found that the tone is way different than most other strings (muddy). However, they do feel good and for the Rocksmith game they do perform very well.

If you want these to lean your strings with Rocksmith then I do recommend them... just don't expect something that will last. Since they are about 1/2 to 1/3 the price of other strings I guess that replacing them 3:1 they might be okay.",0

1745,"UPDATE: (about 30 shows in).  I use this pedal a lot to play live shows.  Each show is 3 sets. I've gotten in the habit of using the wrench to tighten the bottom bolt every 6 songs or so, so that it doesn't loosen off and render the pedal useless until break when I can screw it back together.  I'm 46 and in decent shape but I notice I was getting a leg cramp near the end of the night which I think is because of how I have to elevate my leg on the pedal, lifting it each hit.  This never happens on a normal pedal.  I bought an LP circle seat to raise me up a bit which levels my leg.  That helps a bit.
--------
Bolts and washers that hold the the pedal to the beater arm sheer off.  Contacted the company who had no washers/allen screws in stock.  Told me ""if they get a returned pedal, they will send me the washers from it.  WTH?  The pedal lasted for about 20 shows when the washers sheared off. The screw keeps loosening without the washer making it hard to play without a worry that the pedal will just fall apart.

At first it seemed like a good replacement to the LP/Gibralter cable pedals, but in the end... it is no better.

The pedal has a look/feel like they are made in small batches in someones wood/metal shop - that is just my opinion - and if it was able to withstand normal wear and tear I would endorse it, but it didn't so I can't.",0
1746,"I got this guitar from Musician's Friend, not amazon.com.

The guitar has beautiful appearance and VERY nice sound. Also the one I got had well setup action - low, but without buzz. It was playable right out of the box.

Now to the reasons of a 2-star rating. I immediately found 3 problems that should have been caught by the factory QC.
1) 5-position pickup switch made static noise/cracking every time I tried to switch it or even just touch. Obviously, a defective component.
2) A tuner on the 2nd (B) string was clicking and working unevenly. A defective component again.
3) The worst. The nut was screwed up: the slot for the higher E string was not where it's supposed to be and much closer to the edge of the fretboard creating a wider space between 1st and 2nd strings than the rest. The nut was showing some signs of an unsuccessful repair attempt here.

Everything is simply better on the Odyssey LTMTS1-Pro.
- The Odyssey is so much lighter, half the weight and still just as sturdy.
- When broken down the Odyssey takes up less space and is shorter in height, but still extends to the same size as ADJ's.
- The crank system is junk on the ADJ, it clicks, where the Odyssey is smooth and effortless to crank up
- Odyssey is cheaper in price
- Both offer the same space for hanging and mounting lights

Note: the model numbers are different because depending on which keyboard you have depends on which model will work.  The SP32 will NOT work with the PX-350.  You have to get the SP33.

This is a dark grey plastic bar which doesn't match the Black CS-67 stand. The pedals are small and does not fit flush with the floor which allows the chord to slide underneath without pinching. I would of preferred a channel on the side that the chord could of been slotted thru.

The left 2 pedals don't appear to be as responsive as the far right pedal.  If you want a 3 pedal solution, this appears to be the only option though.

On a side note, does anyone know of a 3 pedal design that would work with the PX-350M that doesn't have the cross bar for a more portable setup?

1780,"Preface:  I put in 20 years at three diferent USA guitar and amp manufacturers while also touring and recording...

This was a poorly stamped, horribly made bridge with a flawed design.  Acccording to the seller (Kmise-us, who handled my communications well), they were given the wrong units from the supplier and they did not meet Kmise-us specifications...  So their listings are not accurate until the supplier sends corrected units. Yeah.

FLAWS:
The base plate was not flat.  This creates all sorts of problems, especially with the harder finishes that are on Asian made guitars and companies that choose gloss over tone (Carvin/Kiesel is *very* guilty of that).

The intonation screws were too close to each other making the saddle pieces go cockeyed...  Or was it that the saddle pieces were too wide for this bridge?!?!

The height adjustment screws did not rest in the tracks in the poorly-plated base plate.

On some saddles, the height adjustment screws weren't even going straight down!  Like a newly-born foal, they were cast outward like a tripod.

The height screw bores in the saddle pieces were not round, but oval.  30%-40% of the height adjustment screws weren't making solid contact with the saddle pieces!

The height screws were of of varying lengths and shapes.

The string anchors were ""gauged"" which is stupid as hell...  Other than not working for lefty players or upside-down players, try putting a flat or tape-wound on and discovering that your two smallest strings wouldn't fit!

COMPATIBILITY:
The only instrument that this bridge would drop mostly right onto would be early 1990s Yamahas out of Taiwan.  None of the others I have worked (Axl, Squier Standard Precision, a Squier Vintage Modified and a Squier Affinity).  Of those, there was only 1 of the 5 screws that would line up. On the Yamaha, 1 was perfect, 2 of 5 were good and the two end screws needed a redrill for proper anchoring.

It isn't price that makes this bad, it's design, execution and bad sales practices by the brand that sends their product to distributors.

So over all I'm very pleased with its a good looking bluegrass pattern and functional fittings.

Best all,

Follow up: well sorry to say but the strap didn't hold up very well; it worked well for about 2 months and then started to roll up into a rope like form over the shoulder and the banjo neck would not stay in the up position :( So I ordered a Gold Tone Leather strap (about $35) and it works great, sorry, but it was nice while it lasted, but I would recommend buying a better strap.

1798,"I bought these because I needed something to go from a 3.5 mm TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) connector to XLM male - so far, so good. However, in my particular application, the 3.5 mm jacks that I am using (and with which these will ultimately mate) carry a balanced signal, as do MOST TRS connectors. Labeling a connector ""TRS"" implies that it is meant for a balanced signle-channel signal. Granted, normally, 3.5 mm-style connectors are used to carry two-channel unbalanced signals (i.e. 'stereo' signals), and my use of the 3.5 mm jacks with which these are to mate is a bit unconventional, but in my particular application, I used 3.5 mm TRS jacks to carry balanced audio signals due to space constraints in the installation.

Enough of that...back to ""the item'.

So... in a TRS connector, the tip (T) carries the V(+), the ring (R) carries the V(-), and the sleeve (S) is the gound to which both channels are referenced; this is the reason that it is known as a balanced signal, because the signals on pins 2 and three are the same as one another, but 180 degrees out of phase. HOWEVER, these connectors, while they do indeed have three conductors coming from the 3.5 mm TRS connector, do NOT mate 1:1 with the same pins on the XLR male. That is, if it were wired 1:1 the tip (T) of the 3.5 mm would be tied to pin 2 of the XLR, the ring (R) of the 3.5 mm would be tied to pin 3 of the XLR, and the sleeve (S) of the 3.5 mm connector would be tied to pin 1 of the XLR. The cable is wired with the signal from the tip (T) and the signal from the ring (R) mating to pin 2 on the XLR; the sleeve (S) part of the 3.5 mm TRS mates with pins 1 AND 3 of the XLR.

So, if you are expecting to use this as a connector to adapt a signal obtained from a 3.5 mm TRS connector to a XLR connection you will not get a balanced signal out of the XLR - it's not physically (electrically) possible.

I think this product is really mis-labeled, because this is clearly designed to take a two-channel unbalanced signal from something like an mp3 player and (kinda-sorta-mostly-in-a-way-but-not-really) yield a signal that is compatible with an XLR female input; normally, and almost universally, an XLR female implies that a balanced (not a single-ended) signal will be fed to that input. These should really be labeled as 'stereo 3.5 mm to XLR male' as that would be more accurate.

Still, to simply tie the left and right channel outputs of an mp3 player together (or ANY output for that matter) is really a bad idea, because you are effectively shorting the left and right channels together in an attempt to sum them to a single-channel signal - if the XLR connector barrel had some reasonably-valued dropping resistors connected to pin 2 and to pin 3, and then the other side of those resistors connected to the tip and ring signals, then you would have a summer (a simple mixer), but that's not what's been done here.

Mind you, this can all be remedied with some small wire-cutters, a soldering iron, and some time. Frankly, I bought these thinking that they really were TRUE TRS to XLR (1:1) and this was a bit cheaper than I could make them; I would not have to spend my time building them myself. As it is, it's a bigger hassle to send them back for a refund / exchange, so I will simply modify them to make them a true 1:1 3,5 mm TRS to XLR connector. That is, I will re-solder the XLR connectors such that:

(This is how they SHOULD be wired):

XLR pin 1 = SHIELD TRS
XLR pin 2 = TIP TRS
XLR pin 3 = RING TRS

Again, just to clarify, this (described below) is how these ARE wired (and shipped) by HOSA - and this is NOT the correct way to wire this:

XLR pin 1 = SHIELD TRS
XLR pin 2 = TIP TRS, RING TRS
XLR pin 3 = SHIELD TRS (and therefore, pin 1 XLR = pin 3 XLR).

Putting these on a guitar to save a couple of bucks decreases the value of the guitar by more than 10 dollars. You've got to hand it to the engineering of these. They figured out how the cheapest way possible to make these and still pass them off as  tuners.

1819,"I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare and contrast.  The Promaster just strikes me as a mediocre harmonica, despite it's high-end name and price.  It certainly looks great (aluminum comb!) and has a nice looking case.  And the notes that play, play well, and have a very distinctive sound to them, almost smokey.  But like the Suzuki Bluesmaster, I find that some notes just don't play, irrespective of technique or tweaking the reeds.  Overall, I don't regard that as any better than the Bluesmaster, just nicer looking.",0

1822,"Please note that I am referring only to the GRAND piano voices in this review, not the electric pianos.

I gave the Yamaha P-105 only one star because the internal sound system and grand piano voices do not
compare with the sound systems or grand piano voices on the Roland C-200 Classic Organ, Yamaha
PSR-S710, and other Yamaha keyboards I've had, such as the DGX-205 and YPG-235.

In order to fully extract the grand piano voices on the P-105, it's necessary to use an external sound system,
such as self-amplified studio monitors or high quality self-amplified computer speakers, or maybe, as someone said
here, headphones.  Even with an external system the grand piano voices fall short of being authentic, whereas in
the other keyboards I've mentioned here, you get an immediate sense of playing an acoustic piano.

The speakers on the P-105 are on the bottom, facing down, with a port up to the top, that doesn't help things.
I really don't agree with this speaker placement. Seems to me the purpose of an internal sound system is obvious,
why aren't the speakers placed on the top? So placing the P-105 on a table top is not the best way to play it.
It's best to put it on a stand.

The price of this piano may imply that it's good enough for beginners, however, the action is stiff and the keys
require pressure.

So read the other reviews here, and try before you buy in order to make an informed decision.",0

1833,"I really wanted this to be a great product.  The screws strip out too easily.  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.  Not much of anything is worth the money these days.  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products.  Why should they?  They already have your money.  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up.  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place.  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage.  Whatever, don't buy one.  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business.  What would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s):  Did you test this product?  How did you test it?  What were your results?  Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?

1836,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this case is only worth $50.  Nothing more.

My case had seal openings around the the case where the metal meets.  One of the locks doesn't fasten properly.  The inner liner isn't glued to the case firmly enough -- there's lots of play and when you push the liner down, you can hear the crappy glue trying to grab the liner.

The fact that SKB charges $150 for a Made in China super-shoddily made case shows how far this company has fallen.  IF you think that Chinese products are a FAIL, then this product should be a posterboy of that universal sentiment.

Seriously folks, this is a piece of crap case.  If you can forgive all that I mentioned above (which others have addressed as well) then you're really forgiving or a total SKB fanboy.

As for me, I saw the Epiphone case in a store and it was day and night better.  None of these cases are flight worthy, but at least you get a case with the Epiphone that won't let water leak through as you're running through the rain like this piece of crap.",0

1851,"I've been using this strap for about two weeks and so far it is not the miracle some reviews would lead you to believe.

The basic problem is that there is simply no free ride with physics: your body/shoulder is going to be supporting the full weight of the instrument no matter what. All that the gel and elastic in the shoulder pad is going to get you is a slightly better spread on the load. That effect with this strap is marginal; it did not provide any great relief for me.

And there are other issues.

As many have mentioned the smallest size strap (Large) is WAY too long. Add in another $10 to the cost to take the strap to a shoe repair shop to have them take a good chunk of length out of the strap and restitch it. Even if you somehow needed all that length, since the shoulder pad is fixed, all that length only feeds out to the back end of your guitar, so the guitar will approach a vertical orientation. A superior strap design has adjustable straps on both ends. Not so with this one.

Another problem is the crazy hard thick leather on the front end attachment point/hole. It's damn near impossible to get it onto a strap button. Oddly, the rear strap end is a softer leather and doesn't have this issue :/

The front end of the strap also has a very hard, thick leather piece that has quite a bit of bulk to it. Probably not an issue with a typical guitar but on my SG, which has the front strap button on the back of the guitar near the neck, the twist due to the attachment point forces that hard bulky pad into my body which is annoying and uncomfortable (attaching the strap end the opposite way as is common with an SG doesn't help much). There is seemingly zero added functionality to this piece and it only serves as a place to attach a brand logo and/or to make it look more expensive(?).

So this strap just isn't working for me. It only affords a modicum of increased comfort and there are too many other issues that simply have not been thought through.

The search for a more comfortable and better designed strap continues :(",0

First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second, the high D (8th string) seems ""dead""; it does not ""ring"" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good.",0

1885,"Deal or not, if you are serious... you do not buy a guitar in this price range.  And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).

1898,"First, you should know I have used a standard Fishman Pro-EQ for over 10 years with great success in large and small church venues, and with amplifiers as well as plugged direct into the system. I have spent three years experimenting with the Platinum Pro-EQ, with little success. Multiple times I have just disconnected it mid-service and put the basic pro-eq back in.

I got this to replace my older Fishman Pro-EQ preamp that had fewer features. I am now back to using the older one. My two guitars are a Taylor 12 string with the ES system, and a Martin dreadnought with the Fishman rare-earth blend sound hole mic/pickup combo. Played through a Fishman Loudbox 100.  I literally have spent hours and hours trying to get something close to the natural sound I get from my old pre-amp to no avail. If it were just one guitar I could see it maybe being my problem, but I just could not get this thing to produce a natural sounding midrange or treble. Using the 1/4 jack, not xlr. Very disappointed in this unit as I had high hopes for maybe a richer sound.

Now, here is the issue...if you have more than one guitar, the ""midrange"" sweep feature becomes a nightmare. Also, the ""smoothness"" setting complicates things. Essentially you have two midrange sliders (yamaha guitars have the same thing on board so I know how to use them) First you use one slider to find the generic midrange sound you are looking for, then you use the second slider to fine tune that to a more natural sound, emphasizing bass or treble depending which way you slide it. The problem here is that the ""sweet spot"" is very, very, very tiny and is different for every guitar. It is not conducive to switching guitars, especially from a 6 to a 12 string.

 On the basic Pro-EQ, it is much easier to just adjust the midrange between guitars. In fact, I made a mark on my pro-eq for my 12 string settings as the sweet spot is easier to find. On this Platinum, I don't think there is a pen small enough to mark the sweet spot on all the settings.

so, bottom line is if you have just ONE guitar, you might get lucky and find the sweet spot for natural sound...or should I say the convergence of all the settings. However, for great sound and easy adjustments between multiple guitars, the basic Pro-EQ is much easier to work with and sounds more natural in my experience.",0

1902,The problem with this stand is that it ONLY fits the mic head that comes with it and it is very limited in range of motion. I wish I had known the limitations before I bought it.  Unfortunately I didn't open the box until months later and then was thoroughly disappointed.,0

1905,"These used to be stronger but the ones I received this week are flimsy and not strong enough to hold a valuable instrument.  Maybe a cheap uke.  The back piece (the part that gets fastened to the wall) is very thin and fragile where the hangers swivel.  Anything over about 3-4 pounds will cause the flimsy plastic to crack and the hangers will droop and drop your instrument on the floor.

The drywall anchors are junk - the included screws are too short unless you are turning directly into an exposed 2x4 without any sheetrock.  So unless you are using drywall anchors you will need longer screws to get through the sheetrock and into the stud behind.

Even if these were strong enough to hold an electric guitar or bass, they do not have anything to keep the instrument from sliding off the end,  The hooks do not curve upwards and the tendency is for them to droop because the bracket is plastic and flexes under weight (and will droop much more soon enough when the thin plastic cracks).",0
1906,"I use this system in a small mobile stage setup.  The base is in a rack with amps next to the stage.  The mics work well for performers on the stage, no more than 17 feet away.  However, the mics also get used in front of the stage, and they begin to break up about 20-25 feet from the base.  They are also difficult to get into a wireless mic clip, because of the various shape of the handles.  You should see people trying to jam this mic back into a clip.  They feel great, with a rubberized coating, although I'd be afraid if they were dropped. (that is why I didn't spend much money on them afterall).  I'm not happy that the power supply is an old school transformer, which doesn't work well in a rack setup, so I have an extension cable inside.

UPDATE:  After use at several concerts I have to lower my rating.  They just aren't reliable.  Occasionally, a microphone will not work at all.  The outputs on the back of the transceiver do not all work correctly, normally I have to use the xlr output to get signal from all 4 microphones.  The 1/4 jacks don't all function as they are supposed too, especially not the combined output jack.  The worst is that the mics will cut out with the slightest peaking signal, even within 10-15 ft of the rack.  I mean they are literally steps away from the unit and they will cutout, anything beyond 20 feet and you are out of luck for sure.  Use fresh batteries every time to avoid signal problems, but there are still no guarantees.  I wish I had my money back.",0

1909,"I bought this based on curiosity to see how it held up against its SM57 role model.

I was not very impressed upon plugging it in. The sound was similar to a $3 Pyle-Pro handheld I bought for S&G's, IE quite narrow and tinny. Now one could argue that, like in all things in life, there's a time and place for everything, and that there may be an application for that type of sound. If only I'd gotten the opportunity to truely test it in its intented application.

One of my buddy's is a bit handsy with things, and he decided to open up the microphone. Not a huge deal, that's how you maintain it after all, but one of the cables snapped just from that simple action. This just happened to occur while my soldering iron was out, so I went to repair it. Lemme just say, they used the thinnest humanly possible cables to wire this thing. It's insane. They also gobbed the heck out of it with the cheapest solder imaginable. Oh the lead-head I had that night.

I swapped the wires out with something that had more than one single stand, and added a ground wire to balance it (it wasn't balanced stock, btw), and went to desolder the xlr plug to affix the new wires. Only the actual plug melted while I was desoldering. They really spared every expense on this, and the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is truely applicable in this situation.

I purchased a Shure xlr plug to finish repairing the mic, but I haven't been able to be bothered to actually do it, because I know that at the end of the day I'll still use my I5 or 57 or even my d112 before this mic.

If you want to practice soldering, and have any interest in installing transformers on mics, this is an excellent, inexpensive project mic candidate. If you're looking to just plug and play and have a good sound, look elsewhere. It's such a shame, because the actual body of the mic feels very nice, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 2-stars instead of 1. The body is good enough that you could use it for something else, but that's literally it.",0
1910,Ive owned dozens of mics. I waned to like this mic. I wanted to like all the mics ive bought. This mic is bogged down and cottony sounding. Id rather use a sm58 because I wouldnt use this for broadcasting thats for sure. Id rather use a re20 which has more top end and is less colored and bogged down sounding.

So now paying $8.50 for just 1 pot...it seems overpriced.

They also don't even seem to fit on regular knobs. I have no idea how to get these to fit on, considering there's not threading on the part where the knob screws into...but that's not the problem. That could easily be solved by using a knob that has an Allen screw in it. The problem is that the knob-part has a larger diameter than standard knobs. I have no idea how to find a compatible knob for this. Also they seem kind of fragile, but I have no way to test that.

The only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because They do have very low friction. I'll give it that. But this could also be a bad thing if you accidentally bump the knob the wrong way.",0

These emit a HUGE amount of RF interference, and there's no way they're FCC/CE tested or approved. Shame on Visual Sound for selling these without bothering to make sure they don't pollute your signal chain.

These supplies (we tested several) were all way over the limit by a huge amount (+35dB, which is more than 3000x the allowed amount). This causes other equipment to pick-up this interference, and any even slightly imperfect metal-to-metal contact will demodulate the noise down into the audio range. That's why people are complaining about these being noisy. They are. Wrapping the entire length of the cable around a huge RF torroidal filter doesn't get rid of the noise, that's how loud they are!

The best thing about these is they put out 1700mA of power, but there are others that beats this with 2000mA of current and don't spew the RF noise.",0

1943,"First off I am qualified to say all of this, being a very capable singer, gear lover and most importantly I'm a designer. I design products for a living, for my own company and I am quite successful. But I'll put it to you. I have an critical eye for the design of everything from a chair, to the lighting of a room, to the interactive menus of machines. I make all of it and think about these things all day long. This is the worst of anything I have ever used. I have had it about 8 months and I think as soon as I am done writing this I am going to box it and list it to ebay.

I'm giving this one star. Not Because it's bad at creating cool/quality sounds but for other reasons.  The TERRIBLE INTERACTIVE MENU DESIGN is very bad, writing this I feel pissed. And I am because I had such high hopes for it, and it has let me down big time. It has UNINSPIRED me. It's should have inspired to me mess with it and create tons of cool vocal sounds, like I do on other equipment.

Sure I messed with it, I've used it a lot but I never felt a pull to really get into it, which is what an instrument should do. I created a couple setting that were ok. I was never really happy with them, always wanted to tweak them, attempted more than a few times but I didn't have patience for the menu and I am a pretty patient guy.

I was super excited about the voicelive touch. I thought it would become my favorite piece of gear in my studio, considering how much I sing and am open to the wild effects. The menu is really really really BAD!

Fist off when it scrolls the name of a preset across the little bar it does it in such a way that it's hard to read easily...Words can barely fit on the bar so it has to scroll them. It should easy to read and know what setting I am on.

I bought this thinking I could tinker and create at least 5 cool presets for some sexy rock. It's just too complicated and a hassle to create presets. THAT SHOULD BE THE EASIEST THING ABOUT IT!!!!! Instead it's the hardest.

There are so many sounds on this thing to flip through and absolutely 95% of them are BAD

It's like this device was made by an electronics company with NO F'ING idea of what it's like to be a singer and interact with it. And it has no OFF button! You have to unplug the little connector. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT EVER, not once. Brilliant ....bravo... good job guys.

Dear T.C ELECTRONICS,

There is nothing I hate more than writing a bad review. I mean that. But get your head out of you know where (sorry amazon) This could be awesome and you are BLOWING it. Give the Voicelive a proper screen. Create a workable easy to view menu. ALSO create an app to run the ""guts/presets/parameters"" which can be controlled separately through a tablet/pc  (A dedicated screen) so we can mess with presets at ease, visually see what we are doing to them, EASILY name and save them. Take a que from line 6 amplifi line/ interactive app. ITS THE FUTURE.

If you do this, every singer out there will want to have one for Experimentation/Inspiration. What is more important than that. It's the whole reason we play. Sorry for the bad review but you deserved it on this one. Fix this and I will come back. That being said the Voicelive Rack looks better laid out( haven't used it though) but all your versions could be easier to use.",0
1944,"I have never played guitar in my life so I was looking for something inexpensive to learn on, as a beginner.
I gave it two stars because it IS a guitar, I like the black color and it comes with accessories. Delivery was also very fast.

Instructions were not included (I have no idea what a guitar tuner is or how to use it).
As soon as I took the carrying bag out of the box, I noticed a problem with the zipper and the bag is really, really thin.

I inadvertently tapped the guitar on a wall as I was walking and it caused a crack in the thin wood...OMG.  And to top it all off, my daughter just popped a string.  This is a nightmare purchase for me and I wish I would have put my almost 40 bucks toward something of much better quality.  This guitar hasn't been in my house for an hour yet and already it's garbage.

UPDATE!
I thought I'd give the guitar a chance and get the string replaced at a music store and they wouldn't touch it.  Simply because the bridge is not molded properly and if an attempt is made to replace the string, the bridge could pop off in someone's face.  They also told me that the guitar shouldn't have cracked when it bumped the wall. I ended up spending about $150 for something decent from the music store. The cheap products are not worth the headache and I plan on returning the guitar.

1956,"The strangest thing about these strings is the wild inconsistency among the strings in the package.  If they all sounded alike, we could write it off as the style of the strings.  Alas, a package of four strings has three completely different sounds, making these effectively useless.  These are entirely contrary to the manufacturer's misrepresentation that the strings ""retain many of the tonal characteristics of round wound"" and that the ""heat treating process increases the brightness.""  Perhaps they forgot to heat treat three out of four.

The third and fourth strings (E and A) have a thick, muddy sound with little or no sustain.  They sound duller than any flat wound or coated string I've tried.  They're not dead, as they come to tune quickly, hold tune adequately, and produce clean intonation all the way up the neck.  They just sound out of the package like there's a mute attached to the bridge.  The sound is slightly better with a pick than with fingers, but still not great.  They offer little or no clarity on slides, particularly on down slides, making these sound more like a fretless stand up than a fretted electric.  The sound is okay, I guess, if you like that sort of thing.  But to be good, all four strings would have to sound like this.  Too bad it's not consistent with the other strings.  And it's not as advertised.

The second string (D) is also thick and muddy, but with slightly more ring and sustain than the other two, but still thicker than any other flat wound I've tried.  That is, until you get above about the seventh or eighth fret, where the string just loses life and all sustain.  Sounds like a completely different string above the half-way mark.  A strange phenomenon I've not experienced in over 40 years of playing more than half a dozen different stringed instruments.

Then (heavy sigh) there's the first string (G), which rings like a round wound.  In fact, it's by far the best sounding string in the pack, and actually offers what the manufacturer promised.  Or at least it would be if it wasn't entirely different from all the other strings.  This one alone renders the whole set of strings unplayable except for annoying practice at home.  Forget about playing these for an audience.  In all, this was a total waste of $30.  I'm glad I bought them directly from Amazon so I can get a refund, unlike many of the private sellers who refuse to guarantee their products.

FOLLOW-UP:  Amazon offered a refund/replacement.  Like a fool, I took a replacement.  Three strings (1, 2, 4) sound fine.  But the other string has a tinny metallic sound I've come to suspect might indicate core separation, as I've found it on several other manufacturers' strings.  This sounds jarring below the seventh fret, but strangely disappears almost entirely above the eighth.  Again, the lack of consistency in these strings does not appear to be a fluke.  Shame their quality control has not kept up with their brag.  Here's another set going back to Amazon, and not for a replacement.  I'm done with these strings.  I just hope someone can recommend strings that actually play.",0
1957,"This is an update to my previous review of this product. I had my Faderport working with Cubase 5 - when I initially got it about a year and a half ago. Then all of a sudden, for no given reason, the motorized fader stopped working. I thought I'd upgrade the firmware. Contrary to my expectations, things got much worse - half of the controls stopped responding.

A few weeks ago I upgraded my DAW to Cubase 8. The Faderport thing stopped working altogether. You see a button or two lit up when the machine is running, but the unit is non-responsive. No driver updates, no fixes whatsoever are available on Presonus.com. I am tired and frustrated with this thing. Searched everywhere on the web for solutions, found none that worked so far. I hear some guys have had luck with old drivers, but all they were able to do was to get this thing to work with limited functionality.

BOTTOM LINE: The idea behind this device is absolutely brilliant. I got it along with an external pedal to punch myself in/out when recording - a great solution when you record alone, both hands are busy playing and nobody else is around to help. No device on the market comes even close to this functionality and price point, yet the software is useless. Might have to sell this thing and move on with something else.

It's a tedious process to name a track/song anything but the default number.  You need to buy a power supply.  The memory chip it comes with is small.",0

1974,"I bought this so I could modify a cordless PA system to have wireless mics as well. Before doing anything, I decided I should try it out. I took it into the high school gym and plugged it in. I walked around with both mics and talked a little bit, and everything seemed to work alright.
I put everything back in the box, and the next day there was a meeting outside and they usually use a small PA system so the teacher's voice doesn't get drown out. Instead of the usual mic, I used these.

First of all, feedback rejection and the signal compression are great. It does have a compressor/expander in it to serve as a bit of an automatic gain control. The people talking held the mics at different distances from their mouths and even were doing stuff with the mics in their hands and the signal coming out of the receiver stayed the same.

But, and this is a game breaker but, every  minute or so the mics would just completely cut out, and the range was dismal at best.

At about 10 feet away, the cutting out got very bad, and even standing about 5 feet away from the receiver it would sound fine then just cut off.

I thought I was doing well by buying a name brand, even if it was a cheaper one. At least it's not Pyle or something. But now I'm questioning if I did good on these. I'm returning them right away! They're completely worthless to me.

Meanwhile, I have a set of unbranded (they just say ""Professional"" on the box) lapel mics that work perfectly without dropping out and with the receiver and transmitters over a hundred feet apart. That set wasn't much more expensive either and it has 4 mics!

I'm returning this and getting a used Audio Technica setup. The situations I need to use this in are critical enough that I can't have the mics cutting out and I need to have pretty good range.",0
1975,"OK, I bought these based on several very good reviews but in my experience these are not very good. They sound nothing like Shure anythings. They are not as clear as even some back up Pyle Pro and Nady mics I have. No crisp highs, a very muddy low and a hoky sounding mid-range. No amount of EQ or effects would save them. Might be ok for the grandkids. Anyway, they were cheap. The case is great however. That is the highlight of my experience with these mics.",0

It darkened the cymbal immediately and I had to buff like crazy and reapplied to try to get it off.  It then had a dark shine unlike the new shine in comes with.  The darkness could not be removed by polishing.  I pulled out an old bottle of Groove Juice.  Immediately it removed the stuck on oxidation.  I wiped the rest of the cymbal gently with Groove Juice and rinsed in hot water, dried and it looks just like new.  Going back to Groove Juice...way easier and a brilliant shine like these come with.",0

It's excellent for a small venue where none or 2.4GHz router is far away or you know where the 2.4HGz wireless access point located, so you can put the microphone receiver far away from it.

1983,"I've had this pedal for a couple of years now.
The tones are good, it's built ok, but it has a few major flaws:

1. Power hungry. 380mA

2. Stacking both OD and Distortion (regardless of routing) gives you a tremendous volume jump, you can't gig with this.

If your clean guitar level is 4, your OD and Distortion around 4.5, then it makes sense when you have OD and Dist together you'd get maybe 5 or 6.
No.
You get 10

3. For years I've used Nova pedals and I've never had issues programming and gigging with the Nova Delay and the Nova Modulator. I'm familiar with tricky features like setting input level, limiting number of presets, scrolling up and down presets etc.

The Nova Drive is a train wreck if you plan on using the programs/presets. You can save your favorite presets, but you can't change them on the fly in ""Banks"" even though that's what ""Banks"" is supposed to give you Instead you get something that's hard to program and harder to recall.

I tried using a MIDI switch to change between my saved presets (MC3 Free The Tone MIDI controller) - no luck.

In a nutshell:

A cumbersome piece of equipment. Hard to use in a live situation. You can save your favorite tones, but you can't stack them. Odd size, odd power requirement.

I get better results with a 808 and a RAT and even though those are not programmable I seem to be able to change ""presets"" on the fly pretty quick.

2002,"I was so excited when I stumbled upon this Pedal.  It offered 11 different delay styles with a tap tempo, what could go wrong!?  The item shipped extremely quick, and came in a nice neat box.  There is a micro USB cable that you can use to power the unit and a set of quick instructions.  so here is the thing.

Pro's: Silver sturdy case, tap tempo, store-able presets, comes with micro usb power cable
Con's:  No battery option, tempo changes when delay is on, result in pixelated beeps and tones, not a smooth tape sound like typical digital delays.
Tube delay was not functioning correctly, until I turned the selector wheel back and forth till it selected it.  This is not true bypass. Gain spikes 3-5 db's as soon as any delay is selected, regardless of the mix knob position.

I really wanted to like this pedal, but the more I played with it, the more I was let down.  I have previously owned a DL4, and I am regretting getting rid of it.  My quest will continue for looking for a small pedal sized delay with similar options to the DL4, under $250.  So I ended up returning the pedal back for a replacement through amazon prime, so hopefully I just received a faulty unit.",0

As a result, the bag tends to tip over when you wheel it--even when you wheel it straight ahead.  It's really bad on turns.  Apparently, it never occurred to the people at Pro Tec to actually put some drums in the bag and wheel it around to see if the design works.  It doesn't and they should fix it.

The trem bar is longer and sticks out away from my picking hand way more than my others. I love it. For $20????? I would buy 3-4 just for parts and just simple upgrades to my guitars. - On another note, let me just tell y0ou, Dragon Fire screamers pickups are china made and super inexpensive but sound just as good as my Duncans, maybe better. Nothing wrong with china products, who do you think floyd rose and duncan buy their stuff from anyway???? china. UPDATE: This is not a tremelo you want to use. maybe for parts NOT FOR LIVE SITUATIONS. 1 - it looks well made and not a big difference than the standard FL. THEN, I would come home and the strings on this guitar would be popped off from the string lockers/saddles. not broken, slipped out. this is the #1 biggest issue. and its a major issue.

2013,"I own several Rolls products and am satisfied with all of them, except this one.  The workmanship was terrible.  It feels solid in your hand, but the potentiometers cut out left or right channels intermittently.  Additionally, the unit adds severe distortion to the signal long before it's maxed out.  in fact, the distortion is grotesque and unbearable beyond the 5 setting on any channel, with input volumes at any audible level (for my uses, I'm at line level).  I'm confused as to how other reviews are so kind.  Perhaps my unit was defective?  I'm not going to chance another 80 bucks on another defective unit.  Amazon was fantastic in the return process, though, so if you are going to take the risk, Amazon is certainly the route to go.",0

2015,"I would give this product only one star, except that it works well as a modeling amp and has some interesting settings.  The main reason I purchased it was in a effort to have a ""band-in a box.""  The backing tracks can be slowed down or sped up and the key can be changed.  It comes with about 100 presets (although mine only had 90) of back up tracks played by professional musicians.  That sounds like a lot, but as one scrolls through the selections, it becomes obvious many are duplicates.  It also provides an option for erasing unwanted backups and adding those that are more preferred.  So, if one is more into Blues than Metal for instance, theoretically, the entire G-Dec can be 100 preset blues backing tracks.  Plus, there are few G-Dec recorded version guitar books that are available, so one can play along with the Doors or ZZ Top, to name a couple.  The Fender G-Dec Web page also shows a bunch of cool guitar players jamming and tearing it up with the G-Dec.  The possibilities are endless!

However...I quickly became tired of the few presets I liked.  I also became tired of endlessly scrolling to find the few songs I wanted to play along with.  The key for many of the backups was not provided in the information screen so I had to guess by finding the key centers for those backups and experimenting to see if I got it right.  Or else go in and select a key for the song.  The controls are designed so that the knobs and buttons do multiple duty. For me, anyway,that meant having to keep a manual handy to remind myself how to change key or tempo.  By the time I got through the setting up process, I was pretty bored and had lost the inspiration to practice.

I know several professional musicians and teachers so asked a couple of them to try the G-Dec out.  I made no comment regarding my feelings since I wanted to be as certain as possible that I was giving it a fair evaluation.  I admit that I'm not the most gear savvy guitar player who ever lived.  But neither of the two players who tried the G-Dec were impressed either, independently citing the same criticisms I had.  I finally sold the G-Dec to a beginning guitar player who only wants to use it for an amplifier.

As a footnote, I own the G-Dec Junior, which is much simpler to use.  A turn of a dial changes tempo or key.  There are way fewer back ups but it's a quick way to pick a key and practice.  I also purchased a DigiTech Jam Man Express looper pedal.  Between the two items, I have everything I need to get in a good, solid practice without the hassle.  Sorry Fender.  This one's a dog.",0
2016,Not very well built.,0
2017,"I've been using Blue Steel strings for more almost two decades. They've always had the best tone, according to my own ears/tastes, and they've always lasted far longer than other strings. When I lived in FL, this was especially important as between the sweat from my hands and the humidity that crushes human beings on daily basis, normal strings would corrode, even rust in less than a week, even with me doing my best to keep them dry/clean. Blue Steels would last a couple of weeks if we weren't practicing regular, and about a week if we were prepping for a gig. In all those years, I've had maybe two E strings break on me, and if I remember correctly, that was waaaay back when I used Floyd Rose tremolo bridges.

Ordered my first new pair of strings since I had John Bolin do a fantastic setup/custom tuning on my favorite Jackson. The first four strings went on without a hitch, but the B string just snapped in half with barely any tension on it. It surprised me and my roommate, who was changing his strings as well (his weren't BS's, he tried the Drop-C DDT's). I shrugged and said, meh, whatever, it happens sometimes. I popped on another B from a brand new set of DR's that were the same size as my BS's, then began to tune again.

With barely any tension on the high E, it too snapped. It isn't like I've never changed strings (again, almost twenty years of doing it very regularly), so I know it wasn't my fault. I MIGHT have decided I'd done something wrong when the first string broke (in fact, I did, I've broken strings before). But when the second one did the same thing, again, with barely any tension, I got pretty angry.

Since I was right in the middle of changing out strings on three different guitars, I wasn't in the mood to remove all the BS strings and replace with those from the DR set. So now I've got a 4-string DR set, and a 4-2 BS-DR mix on the Jackson.

Overall, I'm very disappointed. I'm extremely forgiving of a product having a defect once in a while, and guitar strings can be delicate creatures. But two strings from the same package with barely any tension seems like a QC issue. I'll have to think very hard about whether or not I'll buy BS strings in the future, as this has soured me for a while, not to mention I'm simply in love with my DR DDT strings.",0

My comments are about these new, black-face Valvetronix Plus amps, which I was considering swapping up to. Examining one in person, I found the materials to be extremely cheap, even shoddy. The little horizontal metal bar is very low rent, and the cloth covering on the box is pretty wimpy compared to my AD30VT. Also, it has no protection on the corners, where the covering appeared to be peeling loose. The model I was looking at was even splitting apart at one corner - and I mean the wood! I doubt sitting on display at a Guitar Center should make a new amp collapse. So give one a good look in person before you buy - I think Vox made a bad call when they planned this amp. The good news is that the shiny grill Valvetronix amps are much sturdier, inexpensive, and basically outfitted with the same features; they also sound good.

2029,"I wanted to be able to use this rig but a couple of issues prevented it from working out for me.  First, to get the intended benefits from it, the recommended software (Amplitude Acoustic, not included/sold separately) requires you to be at least on iOS 8.  I'm still on iOS 7 and don't plan to upgrade until I'm absolutely required to.  The second issue is that I found the mic did not really clip on my guitar as securely as advertised in the mfg's instructional video.  In fact, I had to keep checking it to make sure it wasn't about to slip off, and at one point it did and fell into the guitar's soundhole.

I wasn't too freaked out over the loss of this as I rarely used it in the first place. I thought it would be nice for doodling ideas with when I was away from home. But, it's felt very unnatural to play and reminded me more of the toy keyboards I buy for our six year old. Not very practical. The slider and the percussion versions may have met my needs more. Most DAWs have a setting for using your typing keyboard as an interface. Comparing that to the nanoKEY 25 I would save your money instead and use what you have. You probably won't notice the difference either.",0

In the end, I'm quite disappointed in this amp. I accepted going in that it wasn't going to be as broadly configurable as it suggests it should be, but frankly, when compared to 2 channel amp heads at the similar price levels, it's just got no character. The clean is flat and pushing it dirty is unsatisfying. In the end I found myself pushing it with an OD pedal too often, at which point it begs the question if I was getting my valve amp value for my dollar. Though I don't love them, I'd prefer Marshall or Vox or even Fender heads near this price point.

2036,"The sliders and rotary controls work fine and seem to be good quality.  It has many nice control features and a on/off switch.  The pads and the keyboard, that's a whole other matter.  Unfortunately, the pads are erratic & require a real hard whack.

The keys seem to be well made & full size, but spring tension is way too strong.  The keys are very difficult to play without having fingers slide off black keys or sometimes not sound a note when trying to play riffs, because they have to be pressed so hard and move a long distance before making contact.  They call it semi-weighted, I call it World Heavy-Weight.  It would be a excellent controller/keyboard if the pads and key tension were improved.

Only good for emergency back-up.",0

It's very frustrating dragging this thing around. I've tried to find a way to fix it but all attempts have failed. I depended on a hand cart for a year and a half until I finally bought a real road case. I wish I would have done that the first time because this expensive think is collecting spider webs now.

The guitar fell once and the neck almost broke off but also the neck is cheap don't drop it or it will break.. The pickups are decent and are good for heavy metal for the price point but the cleans are well not that great. Tuners were good on mine the nut feels cheap.

And since there is no USB on this model there is no chance of a software upgrade to correct this issue. Too bad because the small size is very attractive. Personally I'm thinking of switching to all headstock tuners anyway to save board space. The newer ones are increasingly accurate - no difference from pedals. If you must have a tuner pedal look into the new Snark pedal for $50 or so.",0
2050,"I have been doing sound and lighting professionally for over 30 years and this has to be the worst power mixer I have ever had.
I bought two of these (not from this seller) one was defective from the box. The replacement unit was also defective so I just kept the one. I had hoped these would make a nice little unit for smaller shows and perhaps as an emergency backup amp.
No such luck.

For comparison:
I run an old Soundtech 306D power mixer that puts out 300 actual watts. I use it 2 -4 nights a week at medium sized venues (1500-2200 sq ft) and it never clips or cuts out driving two gen-1 JBL Eon 15' full-range speakers and it is over 20 years old!
The Behringer can barely get up to a medium volume before it starts clipping and cutting out.
I used it recently at a very small pool party for background music and it coudn't even handle that.  I had to pull out the old Soundtech to finish the show. Powering just one speaker does not change that equasion.

It is now used only as a mixer for karaoke shows because the power output is utterly inadequate.
And the effects (echo, delay, etc) are barely usable.

I know it is cheap and that is really very tempting but trust me, unless you're needing to do a show in a bathroom or walk-in closet, this will not be the amp for you.

This review is not to reflect on any of the sellers of this unit, just on the unit itself.

Overall this is a nearly worthless piece of equipment.",0
2051,"This strap was gifted to me by a lady who had others she preferred more. Now I can see why.

I don't know why Martin put their name on this. The strap is an embarrassment. It is thinner, less supple, and more poorly finished than any belt I have owned. The back may or may not need felt, but it certainly looks and feels cheap. In fact, the entire strap looks and feels cheap. The only thing that Martin got right is the color.

I expect that I will be putting this one quietly away and buying one of the bestselling Planet Waves straps. They look like they take their guitar accessories seriously. But releasing this strap to the market is a major lapse in judgment for Martin. Sorry for the bad news.",0

2055,"I bought this as the smallest solution I could find to run keyboards into an input block that provided only XLRs.

 I didn't want to have a stack of Whirlwind Directors (which I was using live, already had, and have been absolute rocks - but are big), I did not want to commit any of my new Radial DIs from my studio to this situation (I just didn't need that robust a feature set live).  For this application, a rack DI (either the quad Whirlwind rack or the Radial  solution (which I also have in my studio) was inappropriate and would've caused more trouble than the large individuals.  I really wanted the smallest DI I could find and had good luck with RAPCO in the past as a utility players.  I take care of my gear, so I figured even with modest build quality, I'd be ok. I was wrong.

(Regarding features) The live system in which I used the DBBLOX (I bought 4, one for each mono keyboard) is built around consistent balanced stage power, and everything is properly grounded, so I had no issue with the lack of a ground switch.  Monitors are handled at the console and I have no amp on stage, so, I didn't need 1/4"" thrus.

My issue with the DBBLOX is that after 2 years, only 1 out of 4 are ""as purchased"".  3/4 have needed repair.  Two broke in the same spot (the XLR side, when unplugging/plugging a cable, broke and caused a disconnect to the transformer.  The other, the innards just became loose requiring attention to prevent further breakage/damage.  products with their components rattling around inside are, of course. a concern when you rely on them to get your instrument to the main PA. I have been able to fix them, but, it's still a bad design if 2 out of 4 have required surgery, and 1 was preventatively operated on.  Even after repair, I have taken them  out of service,

As mentioned at the top, I typically buy either proven rock solid live utility pieces or high end studio pieces, so this experiment was, I suppose, a failure,  All DBBLOX have all been replaced by the Whirlwind DI's I already had.

2058,"Real flimsy, not a road worthy piece. If this will sit on your studio desk and not get knocked around or bumped a lot, it's probably fine. Otherwise, it's a real piece of doot. The price reflects the low quality of the piece. I was however disappointed as Hosa usually produces quality gear. Not in this case. Also, I purchased this with the idea in mind that I would mod it to suit my Kemper. Well that didn't work at all. Still takes two clicks of each button to switch functions.

2081,"I ordered a pair of these stands, one for a soprano uke and one for a tenor uke (the Lanikai LU 21-T).

The fork that holds the base of the instrument should be wider.  The rubber coating the forks (upper and lower) has not been attached well and slides around a little.  The tripod legs seem very sturdy.  It would be nice if the feet on the end of these legs were covered with rubber instead of hard plastic; as it is, the stand slides very easily if set on a hard surface.

My main complaint is the size of the lower fork.  It does not stick out from the stand far enough to accommodate an instrument with a deeper body.  So, the stand works well for my soprano uke and for my mandolin.  The tenor uke, with its deeper body, can not sit on the stand well, because the heel hits the stand tube before the neck rests in the upper fork.  So, with only a little jostling, the tenor uke could easily get scratched or dented just sitting in this stand.",0

2093,"1) It is made of plastic, not metal (should be specified in product info). The plastic is fairly rigid, so unless you are placing something quite heavy on it, it will hold without deforming.
2) The shelf is a few inches shorter than the width of the stand.
*** 3) The folded part that slides over the stand lip is loose (does not grip tightly), and will slide around/off if simply placed on the stand. This means that if you bump it, or try to move the stand, it and its contents may be on the floor. I drilled holes in the stand and accessory shelf, and used small bolts to hold them together. This is an okay fix if you have or purchase the right parts, have a drill, and don't mind permanent holes in your stand. But the manufactured design should not have required this fix.",0

In this case, it really wasn't worth the lower price. A gate really needs more than just one dial or it becomes to obvious that you're using one.  With this, it was too difficult to find the right threshold and became more of a distraction than a benefit. It also feels very cheaply made.  I would recommend saving your money for a better piece of gear.",0
2100,"Perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. As strictly an issue of natural acoustics, I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-made Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D-42. It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a ""sound canon"" for it's great natural volume. Adding the O-Port deadened the lows. It just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. It is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. But again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person ""voiced it"" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. The O-port seemed to ""corral"" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. Sorry to be a crab about it--I like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the ""Humidipak"" recall a few years back. But this product was a waste to me.",0

I had to have the gain turned up to 100% and be right next to it to get a usable signal.

However, after using multiple interfaces, it seems like the microphone itself is the issue. Might order another one since I've heard great things about this microphone and maybe I just got a lemon. Will update in the future.

UPDATE 11/3/2017:
I received a new replacement and had the SAME problems. I tested it with different cables and different interfaces and got the same result. To  be sure, I also tested a different microphone, an AT2020, and had no issues with the same cables and same interfaces. I tested all the combinations of these. So, conclusion. I got 2 malfunctioning microphones in a row I guess. Underneath all of the static and noise, I can hear a good tone. It's a shame that none of it can be usable.

The numbers are barely readable, I think they are a sort of sprayed on paint before the gold is sprayed on the knob to give it the ""amber"" hue. The edges are paper thin, which is why I think they chip, and the edges are also uneven. The knobs are not flat on the bottom, I laid one on the table and it was oddly shaped, didn't lay flat. (If installed, it would turn unevenly). DO NOT BUY THESE. Spend the money on the authentic parts, you and your guitar will be grateful.

The shammy is softer, far more durable and I was able to cover all of the hook(which was only partially and inadequately covered by the installed adhesive cloth) Modified, the sling is what it should be. Hope Neotech is reading this. Modified with about 1cents worth of shammy. Can't increase my rating as I did the work myself, but if they do it, then 5 stars.",0

I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working.

2117,"Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible.",0

2119,"I hate Digitech they make Me look stupid. I do Not care what Anyone says this Guitar processor lacks too many features after all why buy are Guitar processor If It lacks too many major features? This Is Not a step up from the RP355 this has less features than the RP355 The Delta Lab Guitar processor has a many features and Sounds just as good and Is easier and faster to program and cost much less and Behringer makes good stuff too at a more reasonable price. And of course I had to buy a used one because I can Not afford a new one. My first Digitech was a GSP 2101 which I gave around $750.00 In around 1995 that was before all the false government bail outs when manufactures had to sell something of a good value to make money. The GSP 2101 did Not have a Drum machine or an Acoustic simulator and did Not have enough memory to used Giga Verb with other than a few effects, but was a monster awesome Sounding that Is got Me hooked on Digitech. Then Digitech for No reason discontinued the GSP and also because of a lack of money I did Not get the foot controller with the GSP 2101. In 2005 Some People wanted to get a band started so I bought a GNX3000 which has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator but lacked Ducking or Shimmer reverb which I was already using In My Songs but Behriger RV600 gave Me back the Sound I was looking for. I compare this RP500 with the GNX3000 but this RP500 lacks a Drum machine and after I bought It I read the specifications there Is No listing for an Acoustic simulator but just like the GNX3000 It has a very nice Sounding Acoustic simulator but the Wah Wah Sounds terrible It Sounds like a busted speaker the GNX3000 Sounded better In fact I heard a $20.00 Wah Wah that Sounded better, I want to try Behringer Wah Wah, and I have Not found the Ducking or Shimmer reverb and of course It has No Drum machine where the RP355 has a Drum machine and Acoustic simulator and Ducking or Shimmer reverb when I bout the RP500 I thought It had all the features of the RP355 but No but what the RP500 has that the RP355 does Not have Is the Marshall JCM 2000 simulator which I think Sounds less dull than Marshall JCM 800 but a $15.00 Danelectro D-1 Sounds good too. The programming Is good once You figure It out. Good or bad Is a question here You can change to any 5 settings with one push of a switch but to get more settings You must push the up button then before It has a chance to change back push another button and If You mess up during a live performance that may be a problem. I Also used a ART tube pre amp In front. If You are looking for a more affordable Guitar processor Delta Labs makes one that has many good features Including a Drum machine and Sounds good too. I Am still trying to figure out what to do about the Drum machine Linux ArtistX has a Drum machine called Hydrogen which can be had for under $10.00 but I can Not get It to work the Operating System Itself works great. I should mention unlike the cheaper brands Digitech made of metal and are very durable. If I had to do It again I would just gave up on Marshall JCM 2000 simulator and have got the RP355",0

2121,"This violin is REALLY BAD. The bridge is not set right and it is too flat between the g and d strings and that makes it harder to not hit other strings. The bow is also nippy very good and neither is the shoulder rest. You can use this violin if you're a complete beginner; however, if you have $90 to spend on a violin I would suggest that you save up a little more money to get the Cecilio CVN 100 and upwards. Anything that the Mindini range has, Cecilio is better. If you have a low budget, then I would suggest getting a Cecilio CVN 100-300.
I have had the Mindini 300 since August 20, 2016 and I did like it at first, but after about 3 months I got sick of the sound. It is very difficult to play on the right strings because the bridge is not as angled as I would like it and this can make it harder to learn how to play. The shoulder rest is also not of good quality. It is very small and it is not very comfortable. The strings are okay, but they do have a slightly sluggish movement on the left hand when you try to get the notes in really quickly; however, if you are playing that quickly anyway then you should just get a better violin. The Rosin is okay given the price of the violin, but I would suggest that you get a better quality rosin because it will make the sound better and you won't have to work so hard with the bow.
Overall I am pleased with this violin at a beginner level. You should upgrade to a better violin after about 3-4 months of learning though.",0

2125,Ok the guitar is obviously good for the price but the thing is I clearly ordered the cutaway style! and I got the regular style! and that`s not cool!,0
2126,"I thought these were regular sticks and not marching sticks - i guess I didn't see the corpsmaster part of the title, either way, expect a big, thick, heavy marching drum stick.

I ended up not using these that much because I prefer the white vic firth marching sticks over these.  The balance wasn't as comfortable as the white ones that vic firth sells and the brown color wasn't really appealing.  The bead is shaped a little oddly - not something I prefer to play with, but keep in mind this is just my preference.  I wouldn't recommend these, but I wanna also say i was sad that these weren't what I thought they were and now they are sitting in my stick bag collecting dust.

You cannot play drum set with these!!! You cannot play percussion with these!!!  if you do you will break or damage the drum/drumhead.  These are strictly for marching band snare drum use, and if you want sticks for that purpose, I would recommend the white ones and not these.  Also, for some reason they feel more slippery - maybe it's the coating? I dunno.  It's a quality made stick, I just don't have anything else positive to say about it.",0
2127,"I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the ""Lite""). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.

I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.

My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the ""Lite"".",0
2128,"I had to return it. It did not feel the same as playing my real electric guitar.  It may work for some people, but for how expensive this item is, I ended up returning it. I am trying to learn to play guitar and I found that the online lessons I was taking seem to be more effective.  The jamstik is somewhat hard to hold, even with the strap, and the sound is just not the same as a real guitar.  The mute button is not very functional, and more complex chords are hard to play, it sometimes doesn't pick up where all my fingers are.  Tension of the strings was not exactly the same as my electric either.  For the right person this may be a good product, but it wasn't for me.  Unless you need an ultraportable guitar, I would just get a cheap electric to learn.  Maybe if you had a reason to use midi  to make different sounds this could be of use, but I found that the differences from a real guitar we're not ideal for learning.",0
2129,"If you're looking for serious volume reduction, these are not it. They do reduce the volume, but not enough to make me feel comfortable. If I'm concerned that I'll be in a situation where I have to protect my hearing, I don't want half measures. I gave them 2 stars because I wouldn't buy another set. In fact, if the return window hadn't closed, I'd have returned them.  I won't be using them again.

However, I couldn't go as low as 1 star because this is the epitome of YMMV.  If you think that the degree of protection (an average of 12 db) is sufficient for you, then by all means give them a try.

Also, do the following two pieces from the description seem contradictory? How does one preserve fidelity if the degree of noise reduction is frequency dependent?

* Clear Sound - Our advanced tech earplugs use dynamic attenuation to reduce the overall volume while preserving sound fidelity.

*  Protection - Average of 12dB Noise Reduction Rating (NRR). In critical midrange frequencies  where the risk of hearing damage is the highest  the DUBS offer up to 24dB of attenuation.

FWIW, I had the impression that the high range was reduced along with the midrange.",0

2138,"I purchased this amp at my local Guitar Center. The amp actually sounds pretty amazing with a nice mix of smooth lows and cut through highs. It sounds bigger than it's 10 inch speaker. However, the main issue and why 2 stars... this amp has some serious cabinet buzzing/rattling on the lower register notes (mainly E, A and G). It's useless for recording and it was very annoying while practicing. I took it back to Guitar Center and tried a 2nd amp with the same annoying results. I read a few articles where players changed the speaker and tightened the baffle (never heard of a baffle until now) with positive results and the buzzing/rattling eliminated. But for the amount of money this amp cost I can't accept having to spend even money to fix something that never should have left the Fender factory. If I change speakers it will be because I desire a certain tone, not to fix a defect.

With that said, aside from the issue that I can't get past, it really is a great sounding amp. I was able to turn up to 5 with my Tele before it started to seriously breakup. I think it's a great practice amp and it could also be used on gigs where stage volume isn't to loud. It probably would need to be mic'd.

I love Fender products and use mostly Fender on my gigs. I was pretty excited to add a Silverface Princeton Reverb to my collection, but this has been pretty disappointing. I hope Fender addresses this. I ended up ordering a '65 Princeton Reverb hoping to get better results. We'll see...",0
2139,"This is an update of my original review, at first I gave this 5 stars, but know I start having issues.
The worst part is that I'am not alone in this. I have to say up front that when It was working normal the recording experience and quality was awesome.(see the original review at the end of my updated review)
But read the bad part first:
I am responsible for recording the sermons in my church. And Since my laptop is way better than the old desktop they have there, I use my own laptop with this interface I purchased for home use, but also with the sermon recordings in mind. At first it went great. But after almost a year I start having more and more dropped signals in my recordings. At first I though it was the sound mixer from my church. But after listening to the backup recordings, I still make on the old desktop, with the use of a Behringer UCA202 audio interface. I notice that those recordings were flawless. So it had to be the M-Track Plus. Worst of all I was so confindent in this brand that I purched a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-Audio-Keystation-88-II-88-Key-USB-MIDI-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B00IWTS58A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M-Audio Keystation 88 II 88-Key USB MIDI Keyboard Controller</a>&nbsp;to work with this audio interface. Since I really like orginal sounding piano sounds, I thought why not skip the expensive keyboards and buy a simple Midi controller to play my VST Piano trough the M-track plus. It turns out this thing gives me more headache then pleasure most of the the signal from the controller doesn't come through. And I don't think it is the Midi controller because in church I use a Roland XP-60 through midi for the drummers monitor, and the drummers started telling me that he wasn't hearing me al the time.

I now regret that I didn't spend the extra buck to purchase the Focusrite I originally wanted to purchase.

This the initial review I wrote shortly after I purchased. (pleasure read and make your comparison)
Great audio interface I am glad I purchase this version because the digital i/o/ is a real bonus. And the casing is very sturdy. Sound quality is good for my level of recording. But if you need higher bit rate than you should try some of the more expensive onces.
I would purchase the focusrite Scarlite 2i2 but I was disappointed by the lack of Midi in and Out. So I decided to go for this one. And when amazon dropped the price to $105. I decided to buy it at once. Made some great recordings and I even use it in church as a headphone amplifier and to play a VST grand piano through my Roland XP 80. the keyboard amplifier broke down and I can't play the way I want with do cheap headphones and low volume levels I get out of the Roland. Now I play a Grand Concert Piano through my M-audio without any latency. I never sounded so good",0
2140,"Cheap junk. I gambled and lost on this one. It was too much of a pain to pack it up and return it. I paid so little for it that I couldn't be bothered. If you are thinking you'll check it out with the hope it will actually be good, forget it. I did that and now you don't have to. Spend more money and get one that works well. This would be fine as a TOY for a kid to use.",0
2141,"Ive owned these for awhile now. I honestly dislike how much low-end and murky the sound is. I put on albums that sound great on everything but these speakers! Directly into the Aux in from my phone. It sounds better with just the speaker from my phone. No kidding.

There's no clarity.
Im not goin to buy Mackie anymore due to this purchase, would rather take my chances on something, anything else.
Dont buy these, i regret it.",0

2143,"It worked one day, the next didn't. (iGigBook and Onsong)
Changed the fresh batteries with other fresh batteries, used the reset button, tried it with USB power - nothing. The thing just freezes with a red light flashing for a few minutes then it shuts off.

Other than that 80$ is too much for this. The built is quite poor. Think cheap, light plastic. And you are going to step on it with your feet while on a gig? Forget it.

Shame on these people, this POS shouldn't cost more than 25$

UPDATE 4/14/13:

I had the original one replaced and the the replacement works. I use it once every 10 gigs, give or take.

When you use the device your iPad keyboard does not work, won't show up - major problem. Say, someone comes over and says, do you know this song or play that song, I'd have to look it up and pull it out to play it, but I'll have to either turn off the bluetooth on the iPad or turn off the pedal so I can use the keyboard to type... not very convenient or efficient.",0
2144,"The guitar looks great (although the one I got had green-tinted pickguard, not white as shown on the picture) and sounds like a strat should.
However I had to return it immediately due to quality issues.
1) It had a crack on the lacquer surface where the neck meets the body.
2) I had horrible hum that could be eliminated by touching the strings or the bridge. This is a somewhat common issue with electric guitars, but the amount of hum was much greater than with any other guitar I plugged to my amp before. (Note that this is not the kind of hum that humbucker pickups eliminate - the noise was even louder on the 2nd and 4th switch positions).
3) The neck is slightly misaligned - high E string is too close to the edge of the fretboard while the low E is further.

For what it's worth, this guitar is worse in quality than also made in china extra-cheap Giannini G-100 from Costco (where it is sold for $100). Both are made in China and appear pretty identical, but Giannini seems to have a better quality control.  Sound-wize this guitar is marginally superior to Giannini.",0
2145,"This could be a four or five star review. The mic part of the tuner went deaf just a few days after arrival.

I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go.",0
2149,"I bought these hoping it would last longer than 3 months without rusting. It didn't. I wipe the strings after playing and keep my guitar in a hard shell case and still I could feel rust on the strings after less than 2 months, so for me it's not worth the extra cost.",0
2150,I had to see what all the buzz was and I should have stuck with what works for me. The harp I received plays really stiff. Not free blowing like some reviews I've read and I don't like the sound of the reads. Sorry. I wanted to find a better harp. I don't know why. Maybe I thought it would made me a better player. It's still Honer for me.,0
2151,"Too bad, Maholo brands have gone way down in quality. Bought 20 to resell to preschool teachers at a conference and sent them all back after tuning and playing 5 of them.

2152,"Initially... it looked amazing, but it was only pretty. It just had an awful fret job, It was unusable as a guitar neck with reasonable action and there were dead frets everywhere. I would be careful buying a guitar neck and spend a little more to make sure you get something quality. The neck is essentially your whole guitar and how it plays and feels and a cheap neck will totally ruin your guitar build.",0
2153,"Too bad, it's pretty clear most of these reviews were written by people who don't know how a drum is supposed to work or sound. I figured I'd take a leap on this to have a cheap snare lying around. As others have noted, the throw-off just flat out doesn't work. It won't stay tight. Which means you can't really tighten the snares. Which means the drum sucks. Tried replacing the plastic tabs with string, didn't help. Sometimes it feels like when you try to pull the throw-off up, the whole mechanism is just going to break off.

Whatever. It makes noise when you hit it. So I guess you can use it. But it'll sound like crap. The snare isn't tight and it's got overtones galore. Don't buy it.",0
2154,IT FELL APART. PLASTIC LENS CAME UNDONE. CHEAP BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. NOT BRIGHT.,0
2155,"For  70 bucks what do you expect, right?  Well, not much.  This amp is one of the most  frustrating amps I've ever worked with.  The amp has a clean channel and a distortion channel but what makes me furious is the fact you always have to toggle the switches yourself to get a true sound out of it.  Say you turn the amp off while it was on clean and then you turn it back on and switch to some crunch or distortion.  You are going to have preset effects attached to the channel.  It's so absurd.  The amp, after many adjustments, can get a  somewhat true clean channel sound but it still has a  slight hint of something being phoned in over the top of it.  Probably one of the many useless  presets it has.  All of the effects sound phoned in on this thing.  Nothing sounds true to pitch.  IT all sounds like your guitar is being plugged into a toy and then filtered with some absurd, cheap affects.

I was pretty upset with it at first but then I thought to myself, it was only 70 bucks and I don't use it for gigs or anything like that so why cry about it.  This amp is probably good for someone who just got into guitar, doesn't know if he wants to stick with it and or someone who wants to toggle in a clean channel manually every time and record with it via PC.  There you can use software to mask the cheapness  that comes from the amp itself.  I've played for  17 years, 8 years of that professionally.  This amp isn't worth much.  To get any kind of ""decent"" crunch or distortion out of it you have to crank it up so loud all you hear is noise.

Save your 70 bucks and put it towards a decent Vox tube amp or a  Marshal 10inch amp.  Hell, you can buy a decent gigging Marshal amp for about 250 bucks.",0
2156,"I wanted to like these, but even out of the box there was some let down. They are very cheaply made. Threads all over the place, the stitching is uneven (especially noticeable where the velcro is sewn on, on all three of them the patches were different sizes o. O), the velcro is intended to stick onto not the proper other half, but the cloth band of the fretwrap itself, which it barely sticks to. The cloth on the one I put on my Ibanez SIX28 started coming unglued/peeling off the foam where the velcro is supposed to stick.

As for the fitting, I'd get the XL if you can find it (don't think it's on Amazon atm). On my 8-string guitar, I was able to just barely get the strap through the ring by the nut, and then the loop holding the ring twisted as well as the ring orienting itself oblong vs sideways. It was pretty tight down on the strings, too.

On my GVB36 6-string bass (54mm at the nut, 1mm narrower than the SIX28 but a little thicker), it was a little better, but still so tight it was almost capo'ing the outer strings.

all in all it was just a cheaply made and feeling product that didn't live up to any of my expectations, while not even fitting my instruments despite the claims. Maybe it fits other 6-string basses or 8-string guitars, but they didn't fit mine, and the quality level was just poor.",0

2169,"Let me start with what I do like:  The ability to keep it on the guitar without it looking obtrusive like the traditional capo.

What I don't like is that when i tighten it many times the part that keeps the capo on the guitar comes unsnapped.  I checked to see if I am too tight, but that's not the case.

Maybe it doesn't like my guitar neck?  I have used it on both a Yamaha silent guitar and a Taylor 314CE acoustic/electric with same results.",0
2170,"If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a POORLY engineered pedal.  It can't be ""true bypass"" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.

Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years.

If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)

It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT ""true bypass"" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.

2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple ""first do no harm"" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their ""string"" mechanism over time.  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.

I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver.",0

2177,"This unit has not worked properly since day one. When I initially installed the Scarlett2i2 software. It would not load properly and had to do several attempts to get them to load. This INTERMITTENTLY CRASHES EVERY COMPUTER I TRIED IT ON. AND IT CORRUPTED FILES ON MY COMPUTER CAUSING CRASHES.

Like I said, it does not crash every time. Sometimes you would be watching a video and the sound would cut out, you would hear a crackling noise and the computer would crash. After a month of wondering why my computer keeps crashing, I finally had to get my IT guy to figure out what was going on with this and he told me he has seen many problems just like mine with this unit. It has known software issues, yet it is still being sold. I removed it and computer is working just fine. Then begins my next dilemma.

The company that sold it Proaudiostar, tells me to pound sand on the return because it was more than 30 days. They have a 30 day return policy. So instead of taking care of a customer properly (like Amazon does) they choose to take the low road and tell me to call the manufacturer and it's not their problem. What a lousy response and customer service. I will never buy from PROAUDIOSTAR again. Take it from me. Whenever I bought anything from Amazon, I NEVER had an issue returning defective products. That's why I have Prime and that's why I buy Amazon listed products. It costs a little more, but they treat their customers properly and the money flows because of it.",0

2181,For whatever reason the CB-1 headphones I received had symmetric ear pads and NOT the asymmetric pads that Status Audio claims. I've tried a set with the asymmetric pads and really liked the way they felt. The symmetric pads aren't as comfortable as the asymmetric pads so I am sending them back. I don't care how good a set of cans might sound. If they are uncomfortable to wear it really takes away from the listening experience.,0
2182,If your tone is dirty than get ready for a wall of noise that can only be lessened by lowering the input volume and buying the stock gate and slash limiter. You have chain them together after the amp. That will kill the noise when you're not playing and it won't be very noticeable when you are. At that point though you might as well buy the hd. I don't have it but if it's anything like UA for android it should not have any noise. I even have a battery pickup in my guitar to reduce noise but it does nothing. This is useable but I fell like I should have just bought the HD. The price also went up the day after I bought it from Sam ash. Also remember this is not good with any old android device. You need a device that supports Samsung pro audio or else you won't be able to use amplitube UA and any other app will have lag even on lollipop and marshmallow. If you wanna useamplitube UA you need the irig UA because of audio latency issues with android. Other than that the irig 2 should work well if you play clean all the time but you'll probably want the HD for metal and hard rock.,0

I bought this product by mistake, so my fault.

The D'addario strings themselves are excellent and I've been using them for years.  D'addario strings rate 5 stars in my book, but selling a single string for $5 is unacceptable.  I'm rating this product one star in order to get the attention of other people who might make the same mistake I did, and to re-direct them to a better product.

I have double checked my drivers at the m-audio website and have current drivers installed, but results thus far are the same.

2193,"I ordered the DITTO x2 on May 4th 2015. This was a wonderful pedal. Easy to use, great sound quality, and wonderful looping effects. Then, a handful of uses later, couldn't be worse. The sound quality has completely degraded. When attempting to loop, the first loop sounds fine but any overdubs sound fuzzy and broken, like you put the signal through a bit crusher, only I am not using a bit crusher.
I first noticed that something was wrong when the backing track feature suddenly stopped working. I tried everything on the troubleshooting page, firmware updates, different cables/power supply/usb ports, nothing would work. Since then it has only gotten worse.

2203,"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.

The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.

We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.

We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.",0

They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well.

2233,"I bought this to replace one of my aging Yamaha PSR 3000s. Reading the advertising copy and looking at the You Tube videos, I thought I had made the right choice. I normally research the products, and, seeing that the Yamaha products couldn't come up with a cost-effective replacement, I thought I would make the move to Roland. Big mistake.
First-the manual, or lack thereof. You get a short 'quick start ' booklet in a plethora of languages. The information inside is cursory, to say the least. To get the 'real' manual, you have to download it from the website.
Second-if you wish to use this with a USB port, you will have to download the USB driver from the website support site. I tried on two different computers, and the file would not install.
Third- the 'build'. It's very light indeed, and I was not impressed with the 'feel' of the keys and the keybed. I won't dwell on this.
Fourth- I wanted to use this board to play SMF  (Standard Midi Files) . To say the process to download these files to the SD card that comes with it is convoluted, involving writing files to a certain part of the card. To access the files, the card is put back in the board, and it is booted. To access the files, one has to go into the Sequencer section, and press a few buttons before it prompts you to import. Now here's the kicker...I have 650 files...the board can only access 200.
So I finally got around to playing the SMFs. I compared the sound with that of a 4 yr old Yamaha. The sound was not of the same quality, in my opinion, by a long shot.
The LCD screen is an attractive full-color unit, but the characters are way too small to see clearly. As a live performer, I need to be going from song to song rapidly with a minimum of searching. This unit doesn't allow it, in my opinion.
My last Roland was a D-50, my first a JX 3P, then a JX 8P and since then I have gone through Korgs, Kawais, a Casio, which was suprisingly good, and Yamaha for the last 8 years. If this is the 'new' face of Roland, I think they need some more plastic surgery.

One last thing- the 'support'. There is NO 800 number, and they only take calls on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in a certain time window, which leads me to believe that they are now a 'part-time' operation. They have a 'Knowledge Base', but because the units are so new, there is precious little there. The forums I looked at were not much help either.
Sorry to be so brutal, but when you are laying out for something in today's market, you want something that is suitable. This isn't.

To recap, I am a solo 'one man band', using SMFs for drums and bass. I use two boards midi'd together. This keyboard MAY work for you, it didn't work for me. I would like to say that the dealer, Georges Music have been great, and whatever I buy, I will give them the first look.

There would be no way that a speaker of this size could produce 600 watts of power, this ad is not only misleading, but exaggaration at its extreme. Typically, speakers range from 85-92 db measured at 1 meter with 1 watt applied. Everytime you double the wattage you increase the db by 3.

2243,"This is my updated review of the Bugera 333xl Infinium.

My Bugera died on me Christmas Eve. I was playing with the volume up on 2 (of 10) and had been playing for about 30 minutes then the amp just shut off.  I have no clue what happened to it because it wasn't being pushed any where near its limits and was at a lower volume than I would normally use it at (3 or 4).  I have read online now that the quality of Bugera amps is suspect.  I definitely believe that to be true. I am exchanging mine and hope to get better results with the next one.  I am totally bummed out about this.  I am glad I bought it from Amazon and their customer service.

Below is the review from when this actually worked.

This amp rocks!  The amp came in perfect condition and it is a beast.  I have many other amps i.e. a Vox AC100, Fender Blues Deluxe, Blackstar HT60 and a Marshall DSL 100 and this is now my go to amp.  It has 3 channels on it and they all sound great.  The clean channel gets you a ton of volume with almost no distortion, similar to the Blackstar clean or the Fender.  The gain channel has all the grit that the DSL 100 gets but it isn't muddy like the DSL 100.  The lead channel soars!  This channel is awesome for metal and I use it as a boost from the gain channel (it can use the FX loop as a boost as well).

I am super impressed with this amp.  I am playing it through my Marshall 4x12 currently and it is amazing and at the price, it can't be beat.",0

At its lowest position, in which all the parts fit together as intended, there is still no adjustment for the height of the upper stand, so you're stuck with a fixed distance between the two keyboards, which in my opinion is too much (it's about a foot). That makes the top board in its lowest position about 4 feet off the ground. Too tall for a short person to play at a comfortable arm position. So the upper stand is useless to me. I'll be using the lower part of the stand for my practice keyboard at home, but no way this is going to work for me in a tandem board gig situation.

After calling Marshall's tech support and asking how I can remove the adapter, they asked if there were ""notches"" on either side of the adapter to use a large screwdriver, and THERE ARE NOT.  Apparently a new adapter can be purchased from Amazon with this feature (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Etubby-5-8-Inch-Male-to-3-8-Inch-Female-Mic-Thread-Screw-Adapter-for-Microphone-Stand-2-Pack/dp/B01EKS0H1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Etubby 5/8-Inch Male to 3/8-Inch Female Mic Thread Screw Adapter for Microphone Stand- 2 Pack</a>).

SO MY ADVICE IF YOU PURCHASE THIS...it is a nice little stand, and I have none of the problems listed by other one-star reviewers.  However, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T SCREW YOUR MICROPHONE'S ADAPTER TIGHTLY...there is a little silver knurled ring that needs to be used instead.  Screw the microphone on, but not all the way, then use the silver ring to tighten the connection.  Maybe this is something musicians know, but I'm just making instructional videos and I'm not an audio professional...I didn't know that there is a special trick to this.

You might also purchase some of the slotted adapters (link above) and replace the one included with the stand.",0

2256,"The Voiceworks Plus has exceptional voice quality and fantastic effects. Unfortunately, this is of no value if the unit doesn't work. The first unit I bought had a low level noise at the output. I saw a low level input signal on my Mackie mixer as soon as I plugged the VW+ into the channel. However, all the functions and effects still worked, so I was able to play around with it, although the overall output was weak, and had this hissing sound on it. After trying to contact TC Helicon support, which has no listed live phone number, I received an email response that simply stated that I indeed had a defective unit. I ordered a new one and returned unit #1.

When I got the new unit, I plugged it in and although there was still a very low level noise signal into my mixer, everything worked great, with strong output signal.  Then yesterday, when I powered it on, the noise level more than doubled, and the output signal was very low. I had to crank the output gain up to +10. I also have very little mike input gain control, which makes me suspect the problems are in the mike preamp section. (Note that the noise is present even without a mike attached to the input).

I did get a support phone number after complaining on the TC Helicon Facebook page, but that was late Friday and they don't work weekends. I like the sound and features so well that I guess I'll be trying a third unit. Hopefully I can get one of three to work.

Update 2/10
After discussion with a tech at Proaudiostar (which by the way is top notch to deal with) and also John at TC Helicon (also very knowledgable ), the 2nd unit is going back, and I've ordered unit #3. I don't  want anyone to overlook the fact that the actual tones and voices this thing produces are far superior to anything else I've heard. If you don't get nuts with the gender changing and pitch correction, it sounds like real people. That's why I'm going to keep trying until I get a good one. Hopefully, the problems I've had is just a fluke, or just my bad luck. I had to send my Bose L1 back after only having it a few weeks, and Bose is about as reliable as you can get. I've used their PA stuff for many years. I also had to return my Mackie mixer, as the first one died after a few days. Again, Mackie is a quality product.

Update 6/26/14
A new problem developed now. Occasionally, the harmonies on all patches I've created, suddenly go to hell. No matter what patch I switch to, it's screwed up. Even adds voices to solo patches. If I power cycle the unit, then it goes back to normal. Our act relies so heavily on my background harmonies, I hate the thought of having to send back to repair, but it's getting pretty bad.",0
2257,"The violin was well packed and the shipment from Amazon as always was fast. The caring case is good quality and everything was packaged well. I removed the violin from it's case and immediately and noticed the poor quality of workmanship of the violin.

I am very  disappointed and regretful of it's awful appearance that it was not even worth the time to go any further. I put it gently back into it's case and sent it back to Amazon and requested my refund.

2272,"I received 2 of these.  The 1st case had a tear in the bottom, at the seam (sorry for the bad photos).  I actually bought it thinking my Seagull Coastline S6 Slim would fit in it.  The Seagull is slightly smaller than most dreadnoughts, and since so many reviewers of this case said a dread would fit in it I thought, why not?  Well, it didn't.  but my Ibanez AC240-OPN fit perfectly in it, so I debated whether I should return it or not.  But, this case costs over $100, which isn't a drop in the bucket by any means, so I requested a replacement.

The replacement case was actually smaller inside than the 1st case was.  My AC240 seemed to fit at first, but the top didn't align properly when closing the lid with the guitar in it; and I certainly didn't want to force it closed and risk damage to the guitar.

Other problems with the case include...

The padding on the inside had a funky smell to it.  I did leave the AC240 inside the case for a couple days with the lid slightly ajar, and when I took it out it smelled awful, just like the padding.  I imagine the smell would eventually go away, but it was somewhat off-putting.

The hardware is cheaper than the hardware on either of my Gibson cases (a Les Paul and a Hummingbird Pro) and my Martin

So, because of poor quality control (the difference in size between the 2 cases) and the cheap components (cheap hardware and smelly padding) I have to give this case 2 stars.",0

Mine also created an annoying hissing sound. It didn't clean up the gain hiss until it was practically choking off the signal altogether. Once I pulled it out of the signal chain, most of the noise went away. So it seems like the unit itself was creating signal noise. I run my amp with very high amounts of gain, but at the low volume levels I am at, the noise and feedback is minimal.
I cannot recommend this one. If I were playing where I HAD TO HAVE ONE, I'd spend the money to upgrade to a decimator or a higher end unit. This one just did not do the job, even at low levels.

The problems with trying to use this device for anything more than standalone sound activated or self-running modes are many.  The mode switch on the device has basically 3 modes, auto, sound, and off.  If you want anything more than that, you need the remote.  Using the remote gives you a few more choices, but most of the choices are in a cyclic format, meaning if you want to go from mode 2 to mode 8, you have to go thru 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 first.  So there is no way to jump to different functions directly.

If I just wanted to put this on a table and record a session, it it would be every bit as good as a dedicated digital audio recorder, except you have to remove the mic for playback, since it shuts down output to the speaker when it is plugged in.  I SHOULD HAVE READ ALL THE REVIEWS. The one reason I bought it was to do multitrack recordings on my iPhone/iPad with the StudioMini app. It turns out that it ALSO shuts off output to the HEADPHONE jack, for no good reason, since unlike shutting of output the the speaker, the headphone jack does not pose the trhreat of creating feedback. This is clearly mentioned in at least one of the reviews, but I did not see it prior to purchase.  So this means you CANNOT monitor a track while you are recording another track for YouTube videos or SoundCloud. The idea of a complete high quality multitrack studio in my pocket was alluring, but alas, until Tascam fixes that problem in the next iteration of this product, it is going to appeal to a lot fewer people than it could have if Tascam had just thought about it a bit more.",0

It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use.

For all the marketing hype about how it's been custom tuned to live up to the Orange brand name, it really doesn't deliver the signature sound you associate with Orange. Namely, warm thick blankets of massive blues-fuzz overdrive. It skews much more toward the classic solid state crunch, which is of course what it is. Maybe it's unfair to expect it to sound any different, but that's what the marketing promised, so shame on me for believing it. It gets plenty loud, but I rarely have occasion to take it to that level as it's my bedroom amp. I had high hopes for this combo, but it just didn't thrill me.

2340,"Package - A nice display casing done well and is pretty standard music store packaging

Function - Well, failed miserably. The unit has a level around you thumb area. Pressing upward releases the tension and you simply squeeze the capo over the desired fret until there is no longer buzzing and you haven't gone sharp. All well and good in theory. This is the 2 unit and the last I'm afraid.

  Problem A - the lever for the thumb doesn't release as smoothly as you need it to causing a fumbling with the capo as you are trying to release  and pull it off. It's extremely poor when your are stretching to place in on the end of the headstock. You will drop it occasionally.

  Problem B - Especially the second one I purchased had a problem of sticking or being sticky while opening. Jerky almost. In fact, the second one stopped opening. It just closed more and more and then stuck in the closed position. I literally received the package from Amazon, tried it once, took it off 20 seconds later and it never opened again. Placed my return within 10 minutes of UPS leaving.

Final thoughts - In theory it's great. Just being able to place your desired pressure on the capo without a level and spring or tension bolt, is great...unfortunately these guys just haven't gotten the mechanics down on making this gig worthy. It's slim and light design makes it really desirable and I've desperately wanted this to work, but I'm afraid I can't trust it. Very disappointed.",0

2346,"Well my wife bought these for me for Xmas... At first I thought they were real drum sticks. They are NOT! They are the shape of sticks but, as others have put it they flex, vibrate really, really bad, you cannot just turn them on and off. But..... the worst is the sound. Cymbals sound awful and there is no noise from drum hits themselves. Great for kids to mess with in the dark. I don't really know what to do with them, give them to a kid I suppose. I do play tomorrow night for a New Years party. We do a slow song I think I will use them on it and maybe throw them into the crowd?

I think the manufacturer should say, toy sticks or something....

2347,"I've tried these on several guitars of mine, including a Martin HD28, a Guild D15, a Guild JF-30 and a Guild F212XL.  Yes, they last a long time, but the new sound can't compare with a conventional string.  To me they sound moderately fatigued from the beginning, with a loss of sparkle and high end.  On the 12 string they were acceptable, but that guitar had an abundance of highs to begin with.

If playing amplified with a pickup they sound OK, but otherwise I don't want an expensive new string that sounds somewhat tired from the beginning.  I'd rather use conventional strings and change them more often than play these.  The Cleartone strings to my ear sound much better.",0

2362,"I purchased this device as a way of using my old Iphone 4 as a recording device for spoken words, as well as audio, such as piano performances. Upon testing it for a few days, it became obvious that the microphone and accompanying app are so poorly designed that they are wholly unreliable.
FIrst, the app. I read previous low reviews about the functionality of the app, so I downloaded it prior to receiving the hardware. It worked reasonably well using the built in Iphone mic. So, I thought, this set up might work after all. The humorous part is that the app works with the built-in mic, but it doesn't work at all with the im2 for which it was designed. I use the term ""designed"" freely here, because it's pretty obvious that it was cribbed together by a pack of monkeys. It wasn't easy to get the app to even agree to record anything, but when it finally did, and I played some piano, I found that the playback was completely non-functional. It played for one second, then paused, then played for another second, and so on. Even if you manage to get a recording, the app is so unreliable that you could never count on it when you need it.

As for the unit, it's the cheap plastic that you would expect. The handling noise is unbelievable, and I am used to handling noise on my other higher end stand alone recorders. In fact, the handling noise is loud and clear, and that's about the only part that is. The audio that it captures is average at best. Also, the tiny plastic dial for the gain is impossible to use without disconnecting the entire unit as you attempt to scroll up and down. There is no on/off switch, so the unit is always on, always sucking the juice out of the phone battery. There is no headphone port, but since the mic didn't record anything of use, that turned out not to be a major problem. Finally, unlike the misleading ad, very few if any other apps work with the mic. They don't appear to recgonize that there is another app connected to the 30 pin port, and instead record using the built in mic.

There is a reason that this mic is so inexpensive. It's horrendous. That's why.",0

2389,"first impressions. (1996 American Telecaster Deluxe)
the bridge unit seems built well enough but the entire baseplate unit is far to thin and light. it appears what you are paying top dollar for are the ACTUAL saddle piece design. the price point of this entire unit should be in the 80-90 dollar range, definitely NOT 136-ish. the baseplate itself is about identical/tad lighter then my stock bridge plate. at the price/lack of real improvement....i'm considering returning it.

UPDATE: this babicz bridge forces you to use the 'hardware store' zinc screws supplied to mount the bridge. these screws are sub-par compared to the substantial ones on the US telecaster....this WILL effect sustain to the negative. you cant swap them because the cheaper babicz screws are more shallow and allow their bridge to sit flat. NO FOR THE BIG NEGATIVE (see pics) the babicz bridge plate and saddles are less then HALF the mass/weight of the US fender bridge(6.3 OZ US fender vs 2.9OZ for Babicz)......the single most important thing to sustain is the mass in the bridge (no,not the body). while this bridge MAY improve a Mexican tele or a vintage 3 saddle tele, there is noway it will do it on a heavier tele bridge.
IN SUMMERY: you are paying mostly for saddle adjustability, and 138 bucks is just to much for that if you currently have a modern 6 saddle fender bridge. the 'full contact' theory is great until you realize  Babicz dropped the ball on the fundamentals of bridge-mass. they did a great job with fit and finish (except for the screws).
for this amount of $$$ buy a modern 6 saddle bridge and locking tuners which will add sustain and leave you 40 bucks left over for whatever else.",0

The guitar itself was damaged inside the case.  The fretboard was cracking away from the neck of the guitar at the nut.  The rest of the guitar was flawless but once that fretboard breaks away, the guitar loses a ton of value and needs to be repaired or replaced.  I contacted Epiphone about the issue and they said they would end up exchanging it for a different guitar, which was nice of them but I really wanted this for the looks.  I never played this guitar because of the damage, it went back in the box and was returned to Amazon the day it was received.  Very disappointed again.",0

2394,"I just got this thing yesterday and pretty disappointed in it. You have to wonder do the guys who design this stuff actually give prototypes out to real musicians and get useful feedback from them? I doubt it! I got it to hold my Sennheiser 609 mic flat against the grill cloth instead of hanging over the top of the cab, because you can't get it close up by hanging it, nor get it to be flat against the grill cloth. So, I got mine with the gooseneck attachment, but this adds weight and the grabber doesn't really have a secure tight grab on the cab at all, so putting the mic in the holder (which they DON""T include) made the whole thing kind of flop around and the mic sagged down to the ground. There should be a lock knob so you can force the thing to get a real tight grab on the speaker cab so you can then lock it so its real secure, and maybe some kind of torquing adjustment to really make it grab tight, the elastic band you know damn well its going to wear out eventually so you'll have to throw the whole thing in the garbage. The pads on the grabbing part are a weird design that don't match most speaker bezels, so its not a great gripping surface. The knurled knob to lock the arm doesn't really lock it very well without alot of tightening it real hard. I don't see how you could use this without a gooseneck and get the mic right where you want it, I'd recommend getting the six inch gooseneck attachment. I'll be keeping mine, but my cab stays in my small studio and not at a gig where I think this thing could easily be bumped and throw your mic out of position. I did alot of searching for an alternative to this product, and found a product no longer made that seemed more intelligently designed, this one is just your typical overpriced poorly engineered idea like most junk music gear, but its pretty much all there is unfortunately.",0
2395,"I was really excited about this little thing and bought it at other place, but returned the day after.
Two things.

1. It has TRS jack (the 3rd contact is used for charging), Depending on the type of socket used in your guitar, it may not work. Guitar may ""expect"" ground where the charging contact is positioned.
For example, it does not work with PRS piezzon equipped models (I have P22, piezzon output works with this, but main out ""MAG/MIX"" just does not). Google your guitar model before buying.

2. It uses 2.4 GHz to transmit signal. I assume it just uses WiFi. And if you have your WiFi router close to G10, it does not work. They mention it in the manual (it should be 3 meters apart), but who reads manual before buying, right? For most of the people it may be Ok, but if you have WiFi router next to where you plan to use G10 (like I did), don't buy.",0

2400,"For the price anyone with an IQ over 75 should know that this is probably not a licensed Floyd product.  This was certainly my thought when I purchased it.  I expected a low quality pc of hardware but bought it as I actually only wanted the springs and a few screws to replace some parts on a guitar that had either been lost or worn out.  But this pc of junk really is something.  I have three guitars with licensed floyd rose tremolos.  This would not fit the routing of any of those guitars if I would have needed it to.  The width of the unit is wider than any of my actual licensed units.  The height of the saddles is also much taller.  If you were to install this unit into a new guitar that could be dealt with by setting the post height to accommodate the difference.  But if you were going to use this as a replacement it would not work.  I would only recommend this if you were looking to use a few of the screws springs or possibly the bar.  I did not try the one this came with but I assume it would thread into my licensed units.  Big assumption maybe.

Some Additional info.  My calipers have a dead battery but the width of this unit is about 1mm wider than the routing in any of my guitars making it impossible to install.  The ""length"" is also about 2mm longer than the routing in any of my guitars.  Again making it impossible to install unless you want to open the pocket up in your guitar to install this $20 hunk of crap.",0

2414,"The interface works fantastically given the price. But there are several issues and limitations I feel everyone should know. I currently know of two drivers for the device. The current driver on the website is merely the asio4all driver, which only gives asio functionality. Windows 10 installs a generic audio codec for standard audio use. This works well if you solely use microphone and headphones. You won't, however, be able to use the inst 2 input as a standard audio device. That didn't work for me as I needed both mic and inst inputs as standard inputs for live streaming, seemshow no streaming software I know of supports asio inputs.
So I took to the Internet to find a solution. What I found was that the device used to have a custom driver that was no longer being distributed by BEHRINGER, but was permitted to be redistributed and is even given if requested from support. I installed the driver, and both inputs were going in as standard devices. But unfortunately, I couldn't get audio to go in and out at the same time now. The device does not have enough channels to do that, and I couldn't find any way to get it working. I tried setting input and output to a single channel channels (both mono) but could not get the output settings to stick. And because I need pc audio for the stream it was a no go. I ended up reverting to the old defaults and went searching.
I finally found my answer through third party software called VoiceMeeter Banana. I'm now able to get asio in and out to show up as a standard recording device. It introduces lag, but it's good enough for getting both inputs to record simultaneously while still getting audio out.

Seriously, unless you are solely using asio or just a microphone, be prepared for some tinkering to get everything working. Though I would suggest saving a bit more and getting a better interface with higher sample rates

Edit: 3/1/18
After owning for several months, I've ultimately decided to knock it down to two stars. I have to reiterate, if you only need it for a single XLR microphone input or play on using it's asio interfacing, then this is by far the best beginner interface you can get at this price. But if you need multiple inputs to go through as standard USB audio for something like a live stream, look elsewhere. There are workarounds which I mentioned earlier, but the delay introduced caused a headach when trying to get all stream audio to sync. I've upgraded to the UMC404HD also by behringer, and it does have proper propritary driver support for windows 10. And those drivers also support the UMC202HD, which is only $20 more than this. I would highly recommend going up to that instead of buying this interface.",0

But I find the option to plug in the guitar makes NO difference in sound level between using the mikes alone or plugging in.  Adjusting the record level seems to have little effect either on voice or guitar whether it's plugged in or not. The only settings that seem to do anything at all are the ""enhancement"" options, and those differences are more subtle than not.

Maybe if I ran my guitar through an amp first and plugged the amp into the iTrack I could get the guitar to sound louder?  Anyway, I've had this for several months now and am still unimpressed with it.",0

the sound is just.... not as a bass suppose to sound (to my taste of course). They sound very piano like. Imagine the bass keys 2 octaves below middle C on a bright sounding piano - that's more or less the sound.
By nature they get more piano like the thicker the string is (G and D sound rather OK)

Pros:
Though they feel nice
nice balance - including the B string which is tight and responsive

Cons:
Piano like sound

2425,"I have to start by saying that if you are hoping for a good musical instrument that is ready to play right out of the box, then this one is probably not what you want.  It can, however, be a reasonable value if you are willing to put some work into it or pay a shop to put some work into it.
When this violin arrived, the bridge was already on it and to be able to rosin up the bow and get some sound out of it only took tuning it up.  That is probably the good news.  The bad news is the bridge was poorly cut.  It was neither centered correctly on the instrument nor were the string notches cut in the right places on the bridge.  So all the strings were about 1/4 inch off from where they should be.  Both the nut and the bridge were too high, so the playing action was awful.  The strings that come with it do not sound very nice, and the rosin was broken.  When you go to open the rosin, open it carefully and not over the instrument or case, so you won't have to clean the bits of it off those if yours is broken as well.

Good points:  The case looks nice and seems reasonably well made.  The bow is nothing great, but it is playable.  The shoulder rest isn't anything great either, but it didn't fall apart and it holds on to the instrument reasonably well, so I'll call it usable enough.  The extra bridge looks like it is actually maple, and also usable, if not particularly good.  The satin finish actually looks sort of nice in person. Mine is a bit more orange than the pictures shown of the item, but it is not really what I would call a bad color.  Weight and balance of the instrument are pretty good, and the neck is nicely thin.  The belly does appear to be spruce and the back and neck do appear to be maple.

Bad points: Where to start?  I already mentioned the bridge being badly done. I needed up needing to re-trim the bridge and set it in the proper place.  If you didn't want to learn how to do that, then it could be done at a local luthier or music shop, but the cost to have it set up by a professional could easily run you as much as the instrument cost in the first place.  Getting the bridge right will help with the action but it is still high.  The nut is just a rectangular block of ebony with some slits cut in it, it is not shaped properly for any sort of violin.  The nut also had the string at least 3 mm high, when the string height at the nut should be less than 1 mm.  When I was reshaping the nut with files to make it right, I found out another interesting thing.
If you are expecting actual rosewood for the fingerboard, you may be in for a disappointment.  Under the black paint, the fingerboard on mine was made of some very light coloured wood.  I understand that not all rosewood is a dark red, but one of the distinguishing characteristics of rosewood is that it is at least pinkish.  This is not rosewood.  At least mine wasn't, you may have better luck with that.  I decided to strip off the black paint to get a better look at it.  Some sort of a hardwood, people who know more about wood types than I do guess it to be a light walnut or perhaps hickory.  It has a knot in the middle as well.  But since it seems to be at least some sort of hardwood, I decided to just sand it and finish it with a coat of tung oil and it seems to be working ok.
The tuning pegs are also painted and slip badly.  I scraped the paint off the shafts and roughened the wood a little with some 200 grit sandpaper and now they hold quite reasonably well.  Some of the pegs do have a reddish colour under the paint and may be some sort of rosewood.  The chinrest is made of some fairly lightweight wood that is almost white.  Again, not rosewood.  I found the chinrest uncomfortable enough that I left it off and play the violin without it.  But to be fair, getting a chinrest that actually fits the player already installed on any violin as it comes from the factory isn't very likely.  If you want one that fits, you go to a music store and try some and buy the one you like.
There is also a small knot on the back, but the wood grain is tight around it so it isn't about to come loose and fall out or anything, so I don't care about that.  If that would bother you as an aesthetic consideration, be warned that these violins may have such flaws.  At the price, you are not paying for perfect looking wood.
After all that (which was about a weekend's worth of work) and putting on a better set of strings, and playing it with my usual bow rather than the ""free"" one that came with the violin.. It doesn't actually sound too bad.  The blonde fingerboard I ended up with is rather an unusual look, but I like it better than I liked the poorly applied black paint.
To summarize, this *can* be a nice little instrument if you are willing to put some work into it or pay someone else to work on it for you.  I got mine to where it plays and sounds reasonably decent.  The look is unusual and not perfect, but likeable enough in my opinion.  However, if you are looking for a violin that will play good and sound nice right out of the box, then this is probably not the one you are looking for.
I can even say that after the work I put into it and upgrading the strings, rosin and bow, I rather like it.  I had fun working on it, and I feel what I got was worth what was paid.  However I will only rate it one star, because the chinrest and fingerboard are NOT rosewood, even under the paint.  I understood when I bought it for about 70$ through here that I would not be getting something on a par with a $1000 dollar violin, but I feel this product deserves the low rating for being misrepresented in the description.  In good conscience, I also could not recommend this instrument to anyone expecting to play it at a gig the same day it is delivered nor for a beginner looking for an instrument that arrives in a playable enough condition to at least learn on.",0

2440,"I normally use D'Addario EXL-125 strings, but one of my guitars is a replica Hentor Sportscaster - the famed hot-rodded Strat that was the #1 guitar Alex Lifeson of Rush used in the 80s. Even though I've had good luck with the EXL-125's, I learned that Lifeson used these strings in these gauges on the original Sportscaster, so I decided to give them a try just for the heck of it, and in the spirit of seeing if I could get the replica to sound more accurate.

At the end of the day, I can't tell a really big difference in sound between these and the D'Addarios.  But the Blue Steels break *way* easier than the EXL-125's - and I don't break strings in normal changing and playing. I can't remember the last time I broke a string playing out. These broke just stretching them after putting them on. Now, I break the occasional G, B, or high E when stretching, even D'Addarios, but even being extra-careful with the Blue Steels, I broke a brand new B while stretching after changing strings, and then broke the B out of the NEXT pack I opened to replace it. So I used all three packs I bought in one string change.

So these strings are great if you have a guitar tech and a Dean Markley endorsement and you get as many packs as you want for free, because eventually you'll get a set of them on a guitar without breaking, but for the guitarist on a budget or the stereotypical ""starving artist,"" I find that the D'Addario EXL-125's sound almost exactly the same and stand up to normal usage a lot better.",0

2443,"If I could give it zero stars I would.  I do not know if it is my operating system, I'm running Ubuntu.  Basically the major flaw is the mic is too sensitive even with a -10 db.  So if you try to reduce the mic input volume in the volume control, you have a reduced amplitude signal but then you have a sound that is clipped.  A clipped sound is similar to a distorted or hard limited sound. So you cannot get a cozy proximity effect by getting close to the mic.  You need to be like 1 foot away from the mic which makes it tinny sounding.  So instead of -10 db there needs to be perhaps a -20 db switch because you need to preserve the sound not have it clipped.  If you record instruments with it, again it sounds tinny. I do not know if windows users experience this issue.",0

2447,"Let's be honest, it's always nice to have a bit extra storage when it comes to guitar/bass gear.  The Tick adds just that, although it does add some weight/bulk to your Mono case.

What's nice:  Water resistant design, nice pockets (wish it had a couple more inside), good construction, attaches to your Mono case.

What's not so great:  Attaches with velcro... honestly expected it to have some type of clip attachments, since the rings that you attach it to on the case are metal rings.  Sorry, but velcro only lasts so long.  Second, this things is WAY too expensive for what it is.  I mean, it's just a pouch that attaches to your case.  When the entire case is expensive by itself, add-ons should be more reasonable.  Of course, Mono is probably trying to follow Apple's lead in charging for everything.  This should not be more than $40.  At that price, it would be worth it.  At the $90 price point, it's just not worth it, IMO.

2451,"Using this with a MacBookPro and Garage Band / Logic results in a great deal of electrically induced background noise and makes the cable useless for serious recording. Also, there is no way to adjust input level (which is way too high) except by turning the guitar volume down (which alters guitar tone to an unacceptable level). I selected 'monitor - no feedback protection' and set the softwares input level to zero and the signal was still too hot. However I did experience near zero latency with a low track count.

Using my PC first with NI Guitar Rig 3 (stand alone version) I was unable to select separate input and output drivers (a software limitation) and so there was no way to hear what I was playing. Ironic because the 'plus' version of this cable comes with Guitar Rig 4 LE! Perhaps GR4 allows you to select separate input/output drivers, if so then it may work.
Although I could see that the cable WAS working with NI Guitar Rig (input and output level meters were responding to signal) I could not verify if there was any background noise present like that experienced on the MacBook because there was no way to listen to the output signal.

Using a PC with Cakewalk Sonar I was able to see the device using WDM/KS drivers but I was still not able to run the output anywhere to monitor. The only output option I had in this case on my my computer was the onboard Realtec soundcard (which is junk) and I still couldn't hear anything.

After downloading ASIO4all I was unable to see the device in Cakewalk at all even after selecting it in the ASIO4all control panel. Also, ASIO4all took over control of my MBox Pro which is totally unacceptable for me.

A call to Alesis (20 minutes on hold) revealed that yes, they understand that background noise will be present using a MacBook! they blamed the computer and possibly the poor shielding of the Alesis cable. The tech suggested using a different computer (i.e. NOT a laptop that creates a lot of internal electronic interference).

Well, I purchased this cable to use as a quick way in to the MacBookPro and Garageband / Logic and it appears to be useless for this task.
I can get better results recording with an iPod touch using a Peavey/Agile Amp Kit with no background noise at all!

I suspect that the Behringer guitar interface may be better. At least it has an audio return to phones.
The Alesis shows up as a 1 in / 2 out device BUT IT HAS NO OUT!

I have not bothered to try with Pro Tools but why waste anymore time with this useless device? I purchased it to use with the MacBook and even Alesis agrees it's going to be noisy!

There are stands at the big box music store for 40% less money that stay straighter but don't come with the page holder feature and the carrying bag (which isn't much of a bag but better than nothing).

The item also came with a rusty powder-like substance all over it and deep scratches on a couple of surfaces.

Secondly...they have sent me on wild goose chases to get sketchy and stripped down software at various websites.  And each one of those websites wants all my personal information and forces me to register and create an account.  Focusrite's driver for this hardware unit was not digitally signed---so I had to go download Windows patches so that the computer would accept a sketchy unsigned driver.  ProTools wanted more serial numbers than were provided.....so they made me email them a photo to prove that I actually own the Focusrite unit.

First failure was a noisy fan, starting after a couple of months and which ultimately ended up cutting out entirely.  I was able to replace this myself after finding the part, but it's clear they're using the most low budget fans they can find (and there are two mini muffin fans inside that aren't identical).  And now the left channel speaker output has started cutting out, mostly only working when the unit is warmed up and even then somewhat intermittently.  I'm not sure I'll bother to fix it at this point, and instead invest in something better.

HOWEVER, the edge of the neck above the 22nd fret was not finished (rough and bare un-sanded wood). Did not look like the photos at all or any other 22 fret Stratocaster necks. Also the frets stuck out of the sides of the neck which could easily fixed with a 35 degree fret beveling file and then polishing. Also there was a saw cut that went below the notch for the nut about 1/8and inch. Which is just poor quality workmanship. The unfinished and un-beveled end of the neck above the 22nd fret and the notch for the nut were just not acceptable. Returned the item and bought another two.

If it's not good for all guitar holes they should at least specify in the description the range of hole sizes for which it will fit.

I know it's subjective, but I had a pro friend listen and we both agreed it completely muddied and distorted the sound and the EQs weren't responding the way they were supposed to.  We both said the guitars sounded better bypassing the Behringer.  I returned it to Amazon and made them pay shipping figuring it was a fluke.  ANOTHER friend bought one and had the exact same experience with it.

SO.  This has clearly gotten a lot of good reviews, so if yours sounds like crap SEND IT BACK and order another to see if maybe it was a fluke.  But honestly if you gig in ANY live settings bite the bullet and just get a better DI.  These two are the ones I recommend....

2540,"If it weren't for the protruding rails I would most likely give this harmonica a 5 star rating.  But, the rails ruin the experience for me.  I have a small, well-groomed mustache and the protruding rails catch and pull the hairs at the corners of my mouth.  This is quite painful when it happens and I have even regroomed my mustache so as to minimize the chance of this pulling, but to no avail. The protruding rails also make it more difficult to produce a tight seal and the feel is strange.  Why they designed the harp with protruding rails is a mystery to me, I can see no advantage whatsoever.

What I do like, which keeps this harp from getting a one star rating, is the rounded corners, which make it more comfortable in the hands than other designs.  And, the covers install a lot more easily than on the Special 20 that have those small nuts that are difficult to thread.

But the negatives of the protruding rails far outweigh the advantages of the rounded corners and ease of assembly. Why Hohner doesn't combine the best features of the Golden Melody & Special 20 hardware design is beyond me.

I can see no reason to buy the Golden Melody unless you don't have a mustache and you can form a good seal inspite of the terrible design.",0

There are two issues with this strap:
1. The hook clip is too wide and will not attach properly to the instrument's holding loop. It doesn't fit !!!
2. Even trying to force the hook clip into place and fully extending the strap it is not long enough to be useful. I couldn't bring the instrument's mouthpiece down to proper playing position. It was about 6"" above my mouth !!!

Instead I picked up a Planet Waves cord (which I also reviewed and gave a four star rating too).

Sure, tone is subjective to the person but to be honest with you, I haven't heard of one musician who enjoys this guitar.

The slimness of the neck is probably the only redeeming quality of the guitar for people with small hands, but the sound of the guitar is so ultra thin, a normal dreadnought would drown this thing out. With this price range, you can get solid body guitar that has way better tone. Even the cheaper, laminate body ones are better.",0

2555,"I installed this on an ESP Eclipse II. It fit, but only because the ESP has more room than most Les Paul style guitars have between the bridge and the bridge pickup. I then used the spacing gauge and got the distance between the pickup and the strings set just right.

I started downloading the software bundle, which took forever. Especially the Native Instruments Komplete Elements, which ironically never ""kompleted"" downloading, even after an entire night of downloading, even with a healthy broadband connection.

I then started the very tedious process of installing, registering, waiting for verification emails, re-registering, etc.. This step was just totally ridiculous and borderline- obnoxious. After watching music making software get less and less user friendly over the last 25 years, my enthusiasm started waning pretty badly at this point.

Upon opening the ""Triple Play"" application and pairing the pickup with the USB stick, I was temporarily thrilled to see the dots on the virtual fingerboard responding to my playing. This good feeling didn't last long since I spent another couple of hours getting an actual sound out of it. I never did get anything other than the ""test tone"" to come out of the Triple Play software. It was only when I opened SampleTank's ghastly little user interface (and after AGAIN being asked to register, wait for a verification email for ANOTHER long digit that needed entered in the register screen) I finally jumped through one of the many, many required hoops and.......

I was greeted with the worst guitar to MIDI tracking I have ever experienced. And I used to work in music equipment retail, so I've used Roland, Casio, Yamaha, etc.. Just ridiculously bad.

So, I sent it back. In my opinion, if Fishman wants to be taken seriously with this product it needs to,

1. Streamline the software download, installation and registration process. It's a complete mess, and this is that all important ""first impression"" for most people. And it isn't good.
2. Improve tracking. This is probably a deal breaker to most serious musicians.
3. Make the pickup more petite. Also, improve the peel-off-sticky material that doesn't stick well to their smooth painted metal parts.
4. I saw no evidence that Fishman took support seriously. They post some rudimentary guides on their site, but if you want to talk (or commiserate!) with other users, you'll end up on someone else's forum.",0

2560,"I waited 6 months like most people to get this thing. Polyphonic, 2 voice analog with all these nifty little bells and whistles and I FINALLY got this thing in the mail last week and returned it to Guitar Center within 48 hours.
As much as I would like to say that it's an engineering marvel (as the Korg produced videos you see on YouTube like to say), it is genuinely lacking in some pretty big areas. The first one, is that infamous ""click"" and ""pop"" you hear so much about. On the presets, you don't hear it, but anytime you consider your own sound syntheses (like people do with SYNTHesizers) that click is very much present and drove me absolutely mad. The filter has to be adjusted between about 10 total degrees in relation to the knob to null out the click, giving me about 90% of a worthless filter. While on the topic of the filter, it steps. Bad. It loses almost the entire bottom end when you begin adjusting the LPF, and if you find that sweet spot where it sounds good, ""oh, hello, now I have this popping sound"". There is no portemento on the face of the instrument, which is about the oddest thing I've ever seen. Pitch bend bar is extremely cheap. Extremely. Sequencer is not user friendly. Effects sound very cheap. There are no indicators on your voices as to where 440hz is located so you can tune the oscillators. There are three points that ""sort of"" generate 440, but as much as one should believe that when both knobs are maxed in on direction, they should generate the same frequency,  they do not. It sounds out of tune with itself. Monophonic mode is....backwards. Very odd and backwards, and if you buy it you'll see it. (It can be corrected, but not on the fly. Instead by digging deep into the menu)

Overall I understood that 500 will get you a purchase of x level quality, but my recommendation is that you don't sacrifice polyphony for sound. MS20 mini sounds substantially better than this. Honestly my microbrute sounds better than this and it was a whopping 299 USD .",0

Turn the gain all the way up and low end diminishes. It sounded like a Line 6 modeling amp with the metal settings on high.

The string saddles on this thing move when you don't want them do, and don't roll when they are supposed to.  When used with a tremolo system, kiss your intonation goodbye, as this will choose to rest at any number of places - except the one where you set your intonation.

I was expecting Buzzy and bright, but if anything I'd call them lifeless.

I might try the signature in the future. I love the idea of a consistent reed that last a long time before having to switch. Sadly, these just don't do it for me with sound or projection. I'm using Rico Plasticover 2.5's and Lavoz medium's. I just haven't been able to beat these reeds for now.",0

It comes with all the little extras... a pick guard and other decorative piece, both of which that you would need to install yourself if you care to, an extra pack of cheap strings, picks, a strap, a cheap pitch pipe (fyi for beginners, pitch pipes are horrible method of tuning because a beginner guitar player, unless they play another instrument well and are now picking up the guitar, has not developed a good sense of pitch yet,so it is difficult for them to match the different sounding noise out of a pitch pipe and that of a guitar string... they need an electric tuner) and a carrying bag - NOT A GIG BAG (not that I can imagine performing with this, it is only meant for learning), and just a nylon bag that has no insulation and offers no protection for the guitar outside of scratches and simply serves as a bag to transport the guitar,
I bought this for my niece, and highly suggest that you spend the extra 30 dollars or so to get a decent starter guitar... there are PLENTY of decent starter guitars out there for 80 to 100+ dollars.
When this arrived, it was strung but no attempt had been made to tune them. I tuned it up and naturally they had to stretch, so I gave them an hour, re-tuned, another hour, re-tuned, and finally a third hour and a final tune. For the most part, with this guitar you're only going to play in first position anyway, but past the fifth fret it loses it begins to lose its tuning continuity.
The action is high, even in first position. The neck is slightly bowed to the right on the one I received, but there is no truss rod in this guitar,
It falls out of tune even after the strings have been stretched quite easily. It has cheap, plastic tuning keys. The sound hole is small so if it ever were to be used to perform or rehearse with louder instruments it would have to be mic'ed with a lapel mic or something similar as it would not fit a dean markley or anything the likes of inside the sound hold... which brings me to my idea for anyone who actually buys this junk: put nylon strings on it, as both the head stock and the small sound hole lends itself to a cheap Latin guitar. I tried it, and it sounded a world better. It still gets one star, however, because
As for the sound goes out of the box with a tune, well, you can probably make an educated guess from this review that it is nothing to be said for. One thing I can say is I didn't get any buzz in the first position. It sounds like a very cheaply made guitar that is good for lessons or as a wall hanger, and nothing else... it is pretty though, I like the green finish. The design around the sound hole is nice, and it looks like a Latin / Classical guitar for that matter.",0
2595,"I Installed this unit in a local church on Jan 10, 2015. I was called back because one channel had a very low output. After cable testing all the cables, I noticed that there was a strong electrical smell coming from the unit and then it stopped working. Fortunately I was there to make sure that it was unplugged from the power. This is actually the third Behringer unit that the power transformer inside has burnt. It is not rated correctly for the power requirements of the unit. I have never had any problems with any other Behringer equipment, Just the EQ's.",0

When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.

It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all.",0

2608,"I bought a few of these drum mic clips to help speed up the break-down process after recording live bands. I was using cheap, hard plastic mic clips that secure firmly to the drum rim but are dificult to remove. And there's nothing I hate more than being in the way of the drummer when he's trying to remove his kit. I was hoping the screw-on clamp on these clips would be quicker and easier to attach and remove.

I was wrong.

It takes forever to unscrew the clamp enough to fit over the rim, then you have to screw them tight... but not too tight. I've used these clips a grand total of three times. I've already had two clips fall off because they weren't tight enough and one broken because I tightened it too far.

I've gone back to the cheap plastic clips (which haven't fallen off or broken once in over a year of use) and hold these in my kit as emergency replacements.

I suppose they would work in a studio setting, where you have lots of time to set up and adjust your drum  mics, but for my purposes - fast and cheap recording of live punk bands - these clips were a waste of money.",0

The actual guitar pick (as another reviewer also posted) has a sticker cheaply glued onto the pick.  The graphic flaked off after I played 3 songs on my acoustic guitar.  Pieces fell into my Taylor 812 sound hole and I was not happy about that.  I also included a photo of the flaked off graphic and a photo of the guitar pick right out of the package held at an angle so you can see how terrible it is made.

I super-glued it, tried again, it split again. So right now I have it held on with 3 screws, trying to figure out which other neck to buy. In addition, the nut isn't in correctly, so I needed to saw it down so I could make open chord that weren't WAY out of tune.

2619,"I purchased these to use for our church group event at my house, and based on my experience with them, Amazon shouldn't even allow them to sell on their website. The range is very poor. I can't even get them to go 8 feet in a wall-less (?) room without getting fuzzy and breaking up. Plus, when you get out of range, in order to restore the signal, you have to go all the way back to the receiver and physically TOUCH the bottom of the mic to the antenna. One of the two antenna receivers broke while I was putting it away, and I'm not careless with my stuff.

So, trust me, you won't get any good use out of this model. Naxa is not a good brand. If you're looking for something cheap, but good, go with Nady. If you don't have too much of a price limit, go with Shure or Audio-Technica. You'll enjoy those brands much more.",0

2621,"I got this product a few years back and could never get it to work right, and I work with computers all the time. I kept getting noise going through it, all the time. I deadened my mic on my PC, I turn volumes all the way down. Finally after about a year and a half of it being a paper weight  I noticed this little mixer knob in the middle. If you turn it one way it's Monitoring, and you turn it the other it's Mixing. Little did I know, if you put it in the middle you could do both. It was a real pain in my crack, but once I got that figured out, it was usable. The other thing is recording direct guitar can be a nightmare, the signal was always to hot. I found out that I have to back off the volume on my guitar, and turn down the Main channel volume on the Interface, to make the signal work. I record direct, so I like to use Amplitude for my effects, and even with a good PC, and the setting set to low latancy, I still have some while using distortion and luckily I haven't had anything that I needed real precise, or it wouldn't happen. I'd love to record with my guitar turned up, because I love to back off for various tones, but it's hard with my volume down so far. I seem to get pretty good sounds with Ampltude 3 and it has an Economy settle to put less stress on my pc, which helps. Hope my insight and misery will help someone else.",0

I hate nerdy stuff, though, even though I have been used computers for 12 years. I am a musician, my time is valuable, and I don't mess with some electronic crap just because it looks cool.

I had heard about Stylus, how good is for composers, etc. So I tried the demo. The library was empty. So I said, 'mmmh, ok I'll try to sort this later. Let's learn what Stylus is, because I still don't goddam know'. So I started reading the manuals. Basically, it's a REALTIME GROOVE MODULE WITH A SAGE ENGINE THING.

For some reason, I imagined goddamn Clint Eastwood in 'Escape from Alcatrazz'. Start making a groove in the wall, then after a while it becomes a hole big enough for you to fit and escape the prison. Man, I love that movie.

Going back to Stylus Sage Engine, after 15 minutes I was still scratching my head trying to understand what the hell it is, or more importantly, how I can use it.  Then I asked myself my favourite question: 'Why am I wasting my time?'. So I uninstalled Sage Stylus GMX. Problem solved.
I'll go back to what I understand best: sounds, chords, composition, etc. Goodbye, 'sage engine realtime groove manipulator', whatever the hell that means. It's obviously a product made by some nerdy eggheads anyways",0

Fender's marketing dept. was right on in bringing back this classic.  Too bad they dropped the ball.  The two I have played through sounded nothing like the original Super Reverb.  One of them was falling apart in the store!  The other was at a recording session.  I used it for all of ten minutes before switching to another amp.  I couldn't say whether or not the electrical circuit has been accurately replicated, but I do know the one huge difference between this ""reissue"" and an original.  The original Super Reverbs were hand-wired, and hand-soldered.  These are constructed using printed-circuit boards and 'wave' soldering.  Any amp guru will tell you that there is a huge difference, and there are some of these guys that charge $600+ to hand re-wire ""reissue"" amps to vintage specs using the point-to-point method.  Fender does build many fine amplifiers and they are presently building some ""Custom Shop"" amps that are hand-wired replicas and sound tremendous.  The prices are justifiably higher for the labor involved.  It's a shame they didn't elect to include this classic in that catalogue.",0

Yet I can't hold Gator accountable here, since polystyrene is the de facto standard support material--even in expensive guitar cases.]

The case has a major flaw: it doesn't include recesses for the strap buttons. Therefore the neck sticks up in the air when a SG is placed in the case, and closing the case puts pressure on the neck.

2676,"UPDATE: I've felt for a while that I'm probably being unfairly downvoted by those that feel my review reflects poorly on the Big Muff itself. That's not true. I've attached a graphic to help illustrate how Big Muffs work in comparison to my experience with the Nano Muff. I acknowledge that all Nano's might not have this problem. But I'm leaving the review because I think it's worth having this warning, which is corroborated by someone else's review as well, so not an isolated issue.

I'm in the minority on this one, it would appear. But I have a similar problem to another reviewer here, so I don't think I'm wholly unique. The Nano Big Muff offered a lot more feedback and swampy howls than fuzz and drive to my rig. Additionally, it noticeably dropped the volume of my pedalboard when engaged. Unity seemed to be about 3 o'clock on the volume knob of the Nano, which left me little room to raise the volume and also pushed the pedal into far too noisy to be usable territory. With the volume knob cranked up enough to not lower the overall volume of my rig, the pedal howled constantly when not being played. And when being played, I had to crank the tone high to ice pick levels in an attempt to not get the ""wet blanket over the amp"" effect of a complete tone suck. Some of that tone suck is inherent to high gain fuzz, but it's worth mentioning that the Nano Big Muff really made my amp sound like it was being played through a wall in the next roomwhich it wasn't. I'll be selling this on Reverb pretty soon as it's just not for me.",0

This thing even dimed on master still sucks volume, meaning your clean channel is waaaay louder, so it's kind of unusable as a ""channel switch "" for dirty.

Tone seems ok, a little thin sounding but ok. Tha major problem is the volume discrepancies. I didn't notice anyone else saying this, maybe it's defective? I wanted to use it as a dirty preamp since the v4 (non master volume) basically stays clean even when it's ear drum busting loud. I'm sure I could mess with the eq on the pedal and dime that too to get closer to unity but really that's a bad problem, the pedal should not cut the volume so much when I kick it on. I don't want to have to fiddle with guitar knobs on the fly to get volume close.

2695,"I had hoped my Baritone Uke would fit, but it does not. She is 3.25"" (8cm) deep and even zipping the case up would have produced a strain along the entire body of my instrument. (Mitchell SUB-70S)

The case is also not as photographed. There is no rubber feet, or anything, at the end of the bag where it would stand up. The hardware used in it's construction is lesser quality than what it pictured. There is no labeling on it at all, and no manufacture tag. It looks more like the Gearlux bag than the Lanikai. Much of this is splitting hairs for many people; but bottom line, it isn't as pictured or described. I don't believe this is actually a Lanikai bag.

It also stinks heavily of the chemical type.

If my uke had fit, I would likely tried to air it out and make it work. It would certainly have protected it from all sorts of abuse, had that been the case and as I got it for a great price (it went up by $30 after I ordered mine). I'm sad that I have to keep looking.",0

She sounded familiar with the problem, and said that they could mail me the needed part, if I could drill-out a rivet, replace the part, and then use a rivet gun to put it together again.  I don't have a rivet gun.  The only alternative was to return the stand to the company on my dime -- about $13 -- so they could decide whether it was a ""manufacturing error"" such that it was ""within warranty.""  Even if it was, she said, they would not reimburse me the $13 shipping.  The uncertainty, delay and cost is too much.  I'm throwing the stand away and buying one from another company.

The BRIT and CALIF settings pretty much sound like every cheap dirtbox in the world -- harsh, gritty and nasty.

2719,"I thought this was going to be a good deal after seeing the options and accessories that came with the guitar but it's cheaply made without any pride.
1) Paint: The body itself is pretty good, the design around the hole is a decal that chips off easily.
2) Fret board is flat black paint that has a few bumps and bubbles in it.
3) Bridge: the plastic is a too low, the string hits the other forward fret dividers and makes a ding sound if not pressed fully.
4) Electric plug and EQ: The electric output and equalizer works like it's suppose to.
5) Strings: soft strings that lose tune quickly.

The guitar is playable but I would definitely recommend:
1) Stripping/sanding and repainting or stain the fret board.
2) Remove the cheap decal around the hole and put your own design or just clear coat it to make it match the rest of the guitar.
3) Use a shimmy to raise the plastic support bridge a few millimeters near the 6th string.
4) Use harder strings unless you like tuning every time you pick up the guitar.

If you don't want to put in all of this work to make the guitar better, I would say skip this one and go for the ones in the $80+",0
2720,Ive been a fan of Vox wah pedals for years and was really disappointed with this unit. It was meant to be a temp replacement for my JS big bad wah while it was in for repair after years of abuse and this thing sounds horrible.

2724,"EDIT:  3/14/2013

All good things must come to an end.  Kyser no longer donates money to the Komen foundation, the lifetime warranty has been shortened to a 1 year warranty, Kyser's latest products do not say, ""Made in USA"" on them, and all that good mojo has pretty much been sold up the river trying to squeeze a couple more pennies out of their customers...

For about eleven dollars LESS, you can buy a high quality Kyser knock-off, right here on Amazon, and put the extra money into your own pocket instead of into the hands of some greedy MBA types who ruined what used to be a great American product.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

For every pink capo sold, Kyser donates a dollar to the Susan G. Komen foundation.  Also, Kyser capos are made in the USA by Americans.  A good product, a good cause, a good company, and good mojo...  And what better way to impress the ladies!?  ;-)  Charity starts at HOME!",0

2726,"I expected the back and front to be at a 90 angle because that is the universally accepted angle for stuff shaped like a box: amps and cabinets.

In the open position it's several degrees wider than 90 so things that ARE 90 and fairly evenly balanced at this angle, have ample room to pivot on their edges and flop forward or backward in the breezes. Your amp could suddenly lean back for a few seconds, only to slowly lean forward again seconds later. Could be a noisy problem for amps with spring reverb.

I think the 90 issue is due to the way it's made, virtually impossible to fix the open stand correctly at a perfect angle.  Even so, it will work for some, not for others. I think On Stage probably tested this thing with one or two amps before going into production. A few refinements and it could be much better.",0

Great sounding effects for the most part.  No more tap-dancing.  MIDI control of amp channel switching is a definite plus.

BAD:
Sorry folks but if you think this doesn't change your tone then get down at ear level with your speaker/cabinet and listen close, then completely pull it out of the chain and go direct and listen close.  You can hear the digital conversion.  It's a slight fizzy sound.  Recording-wise you may not notice as we all listen in digital nowadays anyway.  And maybe you wouldn't hear it with a loud rock band either but on your own or in your sound guy's ears, it WILL change your tone in a slightly unpleasant way.  For Line 6 to label this as ""true bypass"" is almost a marketing gimmick.  Yes, with all the pedals off and the global settings in ""true bypass"" your tone will be unaffected (with the M13 in front of amp only).  However, soon as you activate any effect/pedal the unit routes all signal to digital conversion.  If you use the four cable method like I do then you can't switch off the true bypass at all and are now 100% digital conversion (due to no true bypass in effects loop of M13).

2741,"It's great... when it feels like working. I am constantly struggling with it on Windows 10. My guess is the driver is garbage (no driver is needed on Linux and Mac). Audio will often break, which makes both audio and video not play (including youtube, netflix, etc).

The build quality is great for a Behringer product. It would be in the 4-5 star range if it actually worked properly.

I played a song with strong bass, and if a bass line was to be sustained, it played the first beat, but the sustained part went away.

I really wanted to like this device to make my life easier, but I ended up going back to the two, larger devices it was suppose to replace. I tried using it is a direct box for the mics, but it still took the effects I put on them away, and made people sound flat...even my best singers doing songs they always do...still came out sounding flat.

3)The E string is too floppy for this scale. Really floppy. This same gauge might be ok on a 34"" scale, but not for a 30"" scale.

The A,D, and G strings worked ok lengthwise. They weren't too floppy either.

If you have a short scale bass, pass on these.",0

The Planet Waves version is also in my collection and blows this one away.",0

Not a bad pedal, but if you need a very clean compressor, step up to the MXR, Boss, or similar. More money, for sure, but much more versatile and transparent.",0

...until it does.  Because this thing stinks.  Literally.  It smells like it was carved of rubber from the sole of your local gas station attendant's shoe.  I should have read the other reviews before buying.

Another reason to pay attention to reviews would have been to avoid the black smudge that this POS left on the violin bridge.  Cheap rubber.

As to its effectiveness, it reduced the volume of the violin from an 11 to about an 8.  Not as much as expected.

I'm not a complainer, and I leave plenty of good reviews for worthy products.  This isn't one.  This thing is cheap in every respect of the word.  It's bad for your violin, probably bad for your health, and a waste of $5.99.",0

The biggest fault with this product is it is so obtrusive to any serious guitar player. Forget about palm muting or playing your guitar with any amount of passion, you'll end up breaking this thing off within 20 minutes. It feels like a cheap plastic toy. It even had ""prototype"" printed on the back on the one I purchased, not a good sign.

I'll put it this way, if your a guitar player who just wants a toy to have fun with once in a while and doesn't expect much from this thing, you'll probably have fun (if it fits your guitar). On the other hand if your a musician who takes music seriously and is serious about playing, then stay away from this awful, overpriced product.",0

2787,"I purchased the Hercules GS414B A/G Guitar Stand recently and after reading reviews about this bag, I decided to purchase one to make carrying my GS414B stand  a little easier (September 2014).  The material is just average and I am not crazy about the big bright yellow name on the bag or the bright yellow carrying strap. They shout advertisement for the manufacturer.
The bag itself is almost too short to accommodate  the GS414B stand even when it is collapsed to its minimal length. The drawstring barely closes around the stand.
 I may look  around for a different bag which is a better fit  for the GS414B and which is more conservative in appearance.

Update: October 11, 2015
After a year of toting the bag twice each week, the stand is beginning to punch a hole in the bottom of the Carry Bag. Reason? There is no reinforcement inside the bottom of the bag and the feet of the guitar stand eventually wears on the fabric of the bag.
Considering the price, Hercules could have made the bag about 3 inches longer to accommodate the Hercules GS414B stand  and should have definitely added a piece of hard plastic or similar material on the inside bottom of the bag to provide protection from the feet of the stands being placed in the bag. Suggestion to Hercules...forgo the large bright yellow name brand on the bag and instead make it longer and reinforce the bottom on the inside.

Update: Here is the status of the bag as of 12/24/2016. A large hole in the bottom rendering it almost useless. Has been like this for about one year but just decided to take the time to update and add the photo.",0

I just put on a set of Kamaka strings and it is too soon to report on them. They use different metal wrappings for the third and fourth strings (Silver and aluminum). If these fail quickly also, it's back to the Worths. They last forever. Keep tuned.",0

I run the CS-3 right after my crybaby, run it 100% sustain and just leave it on. Increasing the sustain on this jf-10 produces this background hum that ends up drowning out my signal around 50% sustain. Levels where my guitar input could actually be heard, I swear I have more sustain with the pedal off. This will be returned ASAP.

2809,"Purchased this Amp brand new but it had a faulty reverb tank.  Even at lowest volume and intensity of reverb, a noticeable spring buzz and growling happened at what seemed to be lower tone registers.  Never experienced this before in any of the amps I had in the past ever.  I am very concerned about the workmanship at the California factory.  Although the amp was stamped made in California, there appears to be components from other countries in it.  I'd like to know who manufactured the reverb tank.

To test the reverb tank, I took it off the amp and sat the reverb away from the amp and put the tank on something other than the cardboard which it was seated on.  Same condition persisted.  Checked all tubes if they were loose as well and same condition.  Springs appeared un-damaged.

Not sure if this was a shipping issue or if defective from the factory..........

Update as of 9/26:

Received replacement (Note this was purchased through Sweetwater and Not Amazon)
- When reverb engaged at any volume, feedback at any amount of reverb or input level when reverb is engaged.  The Feedback hum occurs with or without
an input connected and only if the reverb is engaged.........

Now sending back the second and hoping the third will be the winner.

What is going on with Quality control at the Fender Plant in California ?????  This is an American built amp and a re-issue of a classic.  Just makes no sense considering I have a Pro Junior Amp and a Hot Rod Deluxe, both made at the Mexico Factory with NO ISSUES.  What is going on ?????

Update 10/1:

Received Third Replacement.  Seems better.  Reverb working without significant noise or Feedback issues.  There is a noticeable small hum when the Reverb is engaged and almost has that same type of hum most single coil pickups have.  Noticed the direction of the amp can be adjusted to minimize.  Outlets are grounded, but this amp is clearly much more noisy than my Hot Rod Deluxe amp.  That amp is plugged into the same electrical circuit and much more quiet.  I guess some amount of noise with the Princeton is expected to a degree since it is all tubes and RF interference can be problematic.  The question now is can I live with some of these issues if I will be recording this amp?  Time will tell.......One thing is for certain though.  If Fender had a chance to make a re-issue that was clearly not hand wired but PCB, then they should have made this amp much more quieter than the original.  Not sure if any of the noise issues were present on the original 65, but this could have been tweaked much more.

Cabinet Buzz and rattling issues - Some of the screws were not tight along the cabinet.  In an effort to stop some of the cabinet buzz I checked every screw and it did little for some of the issues with frequencies in the lower B spectrum.  Just insanely awful to have an amp that Is priced as a collectible on a vintage and have so many issue..........Result - Sending the Third back and getting a Full Refund.

I recommend not purchasing this amp.  Fender no longer knows how to produce this amp and test for such defects.",0
2810,I purchased these for on stage gigging use.

So I cut it open at the end and I saw the inside was terrible quality. The cables are ok for home use, but if you are going to play live, it could kill you. I recommend a PigHog cable if you are going to play shows. This is alright only if you are just starting playing and need an inexpensive cable for home use.",0
2822,"If this Kala UB-T Tenor Ukulele gig bag was in the $10-$12 price range, then I would have given it 5 - 4 stars.  But at over eighteen dollars for this thin bag makes it an ugly lopsided deal.  The padding--if you call it that is almost nonexistent.  I can't recommend this bag.  I believe the Chromacast one would be a much better choice and less expensive too.  Two nice thing I can say about it are--First, my Tenor ukulele fit inside it without any problems.  In fact it seemed to have a lot of space.  Second, there is no ugly branding or labeling on the outside of this case; unlike the Chromacast one.  To sum it up  this is a super thin black ""Plain Jane Brown Bag Utilitarian"" gig bag.  Maybe this is why the manufacturer doesn't to display their name on it.

If the pressing timeline wasn't an issue, then I would have returned these and re-ordered gig bags---selecting  Gator, Kace or Hola Heavy Duty bags.  I needed 13 of them at the last minute when our local music shop dropped the ball and failed to get the bags we really wanted for the start of our ukulele building workshop.  This was the only vendor that I could find that had 13 gig bags in stock.  My Hola Heavy Duty Tenor Bag set the standard for an around $18.00 - $19.00 gig bag and I was expecting the same quality and features from Kala UB-T, but was terribly mistaken and disappointed.

I wanted to go with the ""Hola! Heavy Duty TENOR (up to 27 Inch) Ukulele Gig Bag with 15mm Padding""  as they are a fantastic baq and are price right around $18.00.  Avoid Kala, unless you can get them for $10-12 and knowing that they will be super thin.",0
2823,"Pretty much worthless.  I thought it was slotted like many other pin pullers.  It's not.  It's designed to slip over the top of the pin with a locking ring that compresses the puller around the pin.  The one I bought wouldn't fit over the head  of the bridge pin.  Moreover, the ""handles"" are too small to permit much force in pulling.  I returned to gently using my mini side cutters with a folded paper towel under them to prevent damage to the guitar.",0

That is how far the legs are off the ground in their locked position. Pass this up and go with a better design.

2825,"The pick is nothing more than glued on cork. Overall the problem is not with the quality it's the fact that the cork makes the pick much thicker than you might be used to and that it also makes the pick sloppy in your hand. The cork gives too much flexibility and forces you to grip it harder if you play hard.
Overall there are many products that Clayton and others offer that prevent the pick from slipping such as the sand pick which is basically using raised nubs to prevent slipping. This seems to work better since it doesnt make it spongy.",0

2838,"I think some people are cutting this pedal slack because of its low price, but I shall not. It is simply not a good overdrive pedal because the Tone, from MIN to MAX, goes from 'extremely muddy' to 'muddy'. As far as I know, a Tone knob is supposed to increase the treble and decrease the bass as it's turned clockwise, and vise versa counter-clockwise. Well, turning this Tone knob clockwise all the way will still have as much (or possibly more) bass than treble in the mix, to my ear; all it seems to do is raise the mids. If your guitar has any sort of twang or brightness to it, this pedal will cancel it out immediately, with no way to restore it but shutting the pedal off.

And I'm not a FAB hater; I own (and like) the FAB Chorus.

If the Tone was calibrated properly, I suppose this pedal would be a steal, but instead it is a waste. I'm reading some of the other reviews praising this pedal for its 'warm' tone. Yes, but it must be pointed out that a warm/muddy tone is really all this pedal is capable of. To me, that is unacceptable. It is a limitation that most/all other overdrive pedals do not share.",0
2839,"As cheap as it can get. The cover is thin cheap brittle plastic that gets stuck the second time you try to open it. The fretboard is 1g of low density wood pulp dipped in paint.

2849,"I ordered two Ukulele's for my daughters. One was this Makala and the other the Lanikai. They both cost about the same and we wanted to have them be different to avoid any conflicts between the girls.

Amazon shipped them quickly and they were both very well packaged, as usual. Christmas morning the girls opened them up and the difference was immediately apparent. The Makala looked like a much better instrument. The Lanikai looked pretty, but it also looked pretty cheap.

The difference in tone was astounding. The Makala sounded so much warmer, sweeter and musical. The Lanikai sounded tinny and cheap. It looked like an instrument, but it didn't sound like one. The Makala was quick and easy to tune. And it held its tune from the get go. The Lanikai struggled to hold its tune generally, but on of the machined tuners simply would not hold a tune.

I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund on the Lanikai. It is shipping back today. I ordered another Makal but with the black tuning pegs to maintain a difference for the girls. I am super pleased with the Makala. It is surprising great quality for the money. The Lanikai on the other hand was a huge disappointment. While we did have a tuner problem, the other differences in quality between the Lanikai and the Makala are truly astounding. In this price point, go with the Makala... For sure!",0
2850,"Having played other Cordoba guitars - and ukuleles - which were all excellent sounding and priced reasonably, I had high hopes for the La Playa. I liked the size and overall look - the fit & finish was not bad. However, right from the start, I was very disappointed by the dull, lackluster sound - it just sounded like just another cheap $100 Chinese guitar, regardless of size. So at nearly $300 it was definitely not worth it. I thought it might improve after a while, and I really tried hard to like it, but it was just too far off the mark in the sound quality dept. so I ended up returning it to Amazon.  IMO, a decent quality parlor guitar of comparable size produces a much more satisfying sound.",0

This is a very old and broadly-misunderstood effect that still stirs much controversy.  I think it still may be of limited utility in certain studio mastering functions -- where it is best applied as a VST -- but it has little place with personal stage gear.  It is generally reviled among more experienced musicians and especially by FOH sound techs, who find the effect disruptive to the house mix when used on individual instruments.

2876,"I recently bought the Audiobox USB. The salesman at Sam Ash Music said it had served him well, and when comparing similar products by competitors that were around the same price range, he said this is the one.

I think he meant well. I do not think he deliberately deceived me. i think he probably only used it on an OS no newer than Windows 7, or he may have used it on a MAC.

Yes, I had the perennial ""unknown device"" issue when I tried to install. What is interesting is that I normally just tear open the wrapper, decimate the box, take it out, plug it in and get to work, but not this time. This time for some unknown reason, I took the time to read the installation instructions. I downloaded software and driver updates and then proceeded to install the unit. I got the ""unknown device"".

After a few uninstall/reinstall attempts over a night, morning and early afternoon, even following the multiphase procedure on the support page, i submitted a service request ticket.

Here is where I decided that Presonus is not my idea of a good product provider. I see a lot of discussion about this problem. So, it is obvious that Presonus is aware of the problem. Yet, there is no one available over the weekend to help customers through the issue. What if it is a procedure to follow or a file to download or even an issue that can be resolved via remote access? All of these would be fine. Then if there is no resolution the customer at least feels like Presonus cares about their customers enough to at least try. I am then not opposed to buying other Presonus product.

I am not unrealistic. I know, sometimes even expect, products to fail prematurely or even to not work at all. However, what i do not expect is the company leaving their niche customer community without help from 5:00 p.m. Friday to 9:00 a.m. Monday morning (Central Time). maybe this is not an issue to some, but this is far below the ""fails to meet the standard"" grade in customer service for me. Does Presonus realize that there are competitors, very strong competitors, in the market? Does Presonus realize that once a customer has paid for the Presonus product, the $50 or so difference in price between theirs and a competitor's more expensive offering is not so great a chasm anymore?

When I train sales professionals, I always tell them that mishaps and errors are almost inevitable. However, these are not what break business relationships. It is the lack or poor execution of a plan to address them. Presonus has made it into my ""what would be your response as a customer, if... ?"" lessons.

I think it is obvious what my response was. I uninstalled all of the software, and once the replacement process is complete, I will de-register everything and delete my Presonus account.

I am not angry. I am disappointed.",0

2880,"I hate to give this strap such a low rating, but I have no choice. The Good: The material and pattern of the fish is wonderful. I was so conflicted, but ended up returning this strap. I really loved the color and the material design. It is really a nice looking strap. The Bad: Another guy complained about the edges of the seat belt cutting into his neck and I thought he was being a baby. In fact, the nylon edges of the seat belt are hard and there is no padding. When you use a seat belt in a car, the belt lightly goes over the front of your body. When it is being pushed down on your shoulder with the weight of the guitar, it is extremely uncomfortable. This is the most uncomfortable strap I have ever used, period. Even the cheapest straps work better than a seat belt for support. Go out to your car and run your finger across the hard edge of your seat belt and you will understand that when this digs into your shoulder from the weight of the strap, it will be very uncomfortable. Also, the leather ends are not made of stiff leather, but made with two pieces of thin glove leather sewed together. The ends will not last. The leather used on my strap was so thin and soft, the impression stamp of the name Souldier, left almost no mark, just a smear. I considered having it reworked, but that would make an expensive strap even more expensive, and ultimately decided to send it back. Such a shame. When Souldier uses a more appropriate backing and better quality leather, I will gladly spend the money for these.",0

2883,"I went through five Cordoba Orchestras and each had an issue- they all had very high action that could not be adjusted to advertised specs with A standard setup. Usually, the absolute best I could get was 10/64 at the twelfth of the bass E and that was with the truss rod completely torqued and with guitars that had not yet been humidified (upon humidification, the soundboard rises so the saddle height goes up and you get an even higher action). Was told by classical guitar luthiers only possible remedy would be to bring down the saddle height. They told me they saw this same problem with a lot of Cordobas. Shouldnt have to do a repair like this with a brand new guitar. And Crdoba wasn't willing to pay for the saddle adjustment after I'd been through five of their guitars with the same issue. The seller was running out of Orchestras to send me because they were finding so many with cosmetic issues. Seller felt so bad they sold me the last one they sent at a very low price so I wouldn't have to ship it back. It sits in its case unused until I decide if it's worth taking to a highly respected classical luthier who is in a neighboring state (long drive) to get it repaired.

I was so disappointed with Crdoba. I spoke with them several times and they were very unhelpful. Regarding the high action, their story was that customers wanted it this way so they could bang away to be heard in large rooms and not have frett buzz. This was pathetic- professionals mic their guitars or more commonly, in this day and time, they just plug in to an acoustic amp to be heard. I taught guitar for many years and the number one reason students would quit was because they had a guitar with high action. The farther the string(s) are from the fretboard, the more the player has to increase the force where string will meet fretboard. The playability is terrible and very discouraging. Learning with a good guitar is already hard enough. In addition, the higher the action, (distance), the more likely it becomes that the finger will bend the string up or down resulting in poor intonation. I can attest that the intonation on mine is poor above the seventh fret.

Also, if you live in an area that experiences severe cold (low humidity) or high humidity, good luck keeping your guitar humidified in the gig bag Crdoba supplies. And Crdoba knows this, because to get a full warranty on your guitar, you have to purchase one of their humidified hard cases at the same time you purchase the guitar. They shouldn't even sell a guitar at this price point with a gig bag - some people through no fault of their own just don't know how important humidification is and they shouldn't have to learn by unzipping their gig bag one day and see the finish fracturing into a spider web or find a split in guitar itself. And that will absolutely happen without proper humidification unless you live in an area with year round indoor humidity of 45-55%.

I do not feel Crdoba is a caring company and that their QC is almost non-existent. Positives?  Crdoba offers classical guitars that are all-wood with ebony fretboards, good brand electronics. Most companies will sell you a laminate guitar with a rosewood neck at this price point. And the guitar does have a pleasing voice with suprisingly good sustain and I love the fusion neck. But I ended my search by buying a Martin nylon string guitar which sounds and plays beautifully with an easily gotten in spec action with no cosmetic issues whatsoever. The Orchestra just sits in its case.",0

2899,"NECK
The nut was missing. I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....

BODY
The shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.

PICKUPS and ELECTRONICS
The electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.

STRING AND BRIDGE
The bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.

PICKGUARD
I didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.

FINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
At the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender....
So if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford:
- new pickups and electronics,
- new bridge,
- new strings,
- good finishing and lacquer technique

My suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....",0
2900,"I liked the SKB hardshell case that Fender used to use with American Standards (in about 2008, 2009 etc). This case replaced it a few years ago. I finally decided to try one, and I'm sorry I did. It's a cheap, crappy case. It's made in China, which doesn't neccesarily bother me - but in this instance -I'd say Fender just majorly cost reduced the case and offshored it to China. It shows.

The latches look cheap. The outside looks cheap. The interior lining, rather than being a nice plush velvety material or even just a decent flannel-like material looks like cheap black fake fur from a halloween wig. It is awful. The size of the storage space has been reduced -- which was the best part of the old case from SKB. I don't even like the handle.

It is pretty hard to tell in the photos since everything is black. Now I know why there isn't an interior close up photo on the product listing...

I cannot recall ever being this disappointed in a Fender product. I normally think they do a great job on most products. But this one is a total DUD especially at this price point. I would be disappointed in this case if it cost half what it does.

Sorry Fender -- this case sucks - I have 15 guitars in cases and this is one is so bad I'm sending it back even if it costs me a bunch of money to do that.

Thinking of buying this case? Do yourself a favor - pick something else.

Update: I bought the 1SKB-66PRO (not available on amazon anymore apparently) and while it is priced at $160, it's identical to the old Fender hardshell other than saying SKB instead of Fender in the plastic imprint. I found it online elsewhere. Still the same great case. Note that the 1SKB-66PRO is NOT the same as the 1SKB-66 which is cheaper (about $117). The 1SKB-66 is available currently prime shipped but one reviewer said the latches are cheap. Not sure about 1SKB66...maybe worth a try if $160 is just too much for you, but the ""pro"" is one of my favorite cases for gigging because its light, durable, and has a big space inside for tuner, picks, strap, etc. You can also find the original Fender cases for $80 to $130 on ebay/reverb etc used.",0

I ran this pedal direct into my DAW and was not impressed with how it sounded back on a direct recording..no XLR output and that's ok but the bummer is no AUX in so no late night jamming to your favorite band. I've given up on these multi effect units..The sameness of sound and cheesy effect tones are not for me..I recommend the Vox Amplug which are excellent practice devices and are cheaper than this pedal and offer AUX in and superior tone (use quality headphones).Give this pedal a try  if you want .

The absence of a guitar out and guitar thru renders the Play Acoustic useless for anything but amateur performance.  It'll likely be great at your local coffee shop or open mic, or paired with an external battery for busking.  However, in any more serious gig situation, you're going to have a sound person who needs to control the mix to the main speakers along with another mix for your monitors.  Same situation for recording.  It just doesn't cut it to have the guitar and vocal outputs mixed.  (the other alternative with this unit is to separate them as two mono outputs, which means all the vocal and guitar effects will be mono, which is super weak).

This is a totally fatal flaw, and I have no idea what the engineers at TC were thinking here, especially since the VLP Electric has a separate guitar out and thru and the VLP GTX has an instrument thru separate from the vocal outs.  Buy one of those instead if you want to explore the VoiceLive Play sound.",0
2915,does't keep pick from shifting positions,0

Don't even open the bag, go straight to the trash. You CAN NOT play an instrument with these. 1) they don't come in colors. 2) one size DOES Not  fit all. And 3) you CAN NOT freely move around the fretboard with these. the rubber is too thick. to move you need to lift fingers off the string and move to the next chord. Sliding, pull-offs, hammer-ons are NOT possible at all. Use band-aids.",0

If i use it under battery power, the led flickers and the volume cuts in an out, but I have only used it with the battery for a total of maybe an hour if that, so it shouldn't be dying yet. But even with the battery disconnected and the amp plugged into the wall, the amp will occasionally produce a scratchy, noise. It sounds almost like radio interference, but it happens regardless of whether a guitar cable is plugged in or not. This sound is not created by the speaker though because i can plug it into headphones and still hear it. It's not a pretty sound and it's quite annoying to play with.",0

2977,"I purchased this item as a portable iOS condenser for traveling purposes, as transporting my Blue Spark Digital Lightning around was a real drag.  On paper, it should be a superior product with a larger capsule, better DSP, etc. This item is primarily being used for vocal recordings.

It has excellent build quality, intuitive touch-sensitive controls, and a very useful kickstand.  This unit is built to last and withstand a bit of abuse.

However, the recording quality is unacceptable for such an expensive item.  When I first took it out of the box and did a dry recording, I was underwhelmed to say the least.  Fiddling with a totally raw signal (flat, no compression, no limiter) and applying post-processing, the sound was dull and muddy.  It also picks up a lot of low end (I was about 18 inches away from the mic with 26dB gain) which I EQ'ed out, but then it exposes awful sibilance.

So I did a test.  Raw vocals unprocessed, default settings into both my Blue Spark Digital Lightning and the MV51.  Blind tested four of my friends, all four said the Blue Spark Digital Lightning was superior.

The Blue Spark Digital Lightning doesn't offer 24-bit 48 kHz like the MV51 does, but the sound signature of the unit is FAR superior for vocalists.

I would strongly consider buying both units and returning the one that you like better if you're into iOS vocal recording if you are on the fence.  I've also owned (and returned) an Apogee MiC 96k, that one is inferior in sound quality to both of these.  Would steer clear away from that one.",0

I will be taping the cord to the antenna.  The manual is in microscopic print with some poor translation to English.  They do work.  However, I will be using these in a live situation with a sound and lighting system that will be set up and torn down constantly. I have a very low level of confidence that these units will hold up under regular, even careful handling.  I will have to instruct anyone helping me to handle with extreme delicacy.

There is still some spark visible when I plug the cord into socket so there is some power going into the box, but nothing works.

2998,"I would give this item 0 stars for this price.
I got two different ones in a row and both distorted when the chorus was engaged.
Besides the sound problems, the quality is highly concerning:
They are made from terribly inferior parts and poorly soldered together, which can be seen when opening the case to put a battery in (no separation/protection of the electronics). I noticed empty positions in the circuit boards that did not match between both pedals, suggesting that parts are omitted whenever they run out of them. Many cold solder spots were present.
The cases are made from thin aluminum and the bottom plates don't fit properly. The spray-paint is irregular, very thin and looks and feels like a matte primer. I wouldn't put this near small children - it reminds me of led paint.
Replacing the battery in live situation is impossible since one has to unscrew 4 screws and remove the entire bottom plate.

I understand all too well that some might be functional and will get good reviews, considering that they are 1:1 copies of the circuits from great sounding effects invented by companies like Boss etc.
But at this price with this high risk of getting a piece of junk, they cannot be considered a low-cost alternative to a Boss pedal. Rather get for the same money a used one from any company building a quality product and respecting intellectual property. I don't condemn in general any music equipment made in China. Many are of good quality and are quality-controlled. But these pedals are of the quality of dollar-store junk.

I play guitar since 30+ years, own tons of effects, work with electronics and how to solder, and would think that know what I am talking about.",0

3000,"Having played electric guitar almost exclusively for nearly 3 decades, I only recently switched my focus to acoustic. With a new Takamine in hand, I desired a warmer tone than I was getting with the stock strings so I purchased some wood bridge pins (to replace plastic ones) and these Elixir coated strings based on the handful of reviews claiming how much of a difference it made.
The Verdict. Warmth, maybe. But the sound seems discolored. Less bright and perhaps warmer on the high end, but not as ""bottomy"" or balanced/round on the lower end.
But sound aside, I ran into problems when installing these strings as my low E broke at the ball-end after just a few bends and insertion attempts. Never had a low E defect in 30 years of changings strings. High E perhaps, but never low E. Anyway with a few twists and turns, I made a makeshift knot at the end and got the set installed.
So for now, I'm still playing on them. Don't ""LOVE"" them as far as tone, but I'll give it a break-in period and revise my rating if somehow  my opinion of these ""top of the line"" strings improves enough to overlook the intital defect / poor quality I first experienced.",0

This Chorus pedal creates (to my ears) a cheap, toy-like effect that didn't do much to the synth signals I ran through it.

I'd recommend saving your $30 and applying to something more substantial for a chorus effect.",0

According to description the 1/4 connection is supposed to be solderless and on my old pick up it was so, however this new one has soldered connection-it does, so it is either Dean Markley started to produce  worthless products or Amazon got some counterfeit items in its stock.

She says that she could tell right away that something was wrong with the string, so she didn't even tune it up to pitch at first.  She wanted to let it stretch out a little.  When she did tune it, it broke immediately.  My sister has been playing the cello for about 20 years, so it is very unlikely that it broke due to a mistake on her part.

3045,"Some things are great values, others are cheap. The Behringer is cheap. The clips are cheap. The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change. The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. It's also a noisy pedal. Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined. Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.

All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features. The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. It also has a worth-the-price-alone ""space"" feature. Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.

The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. If you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option.",0

I contacted Hohner and they offered to fix them, if I ""paid"" to return them. I wasn't willing to spend more money on a poor product. The Piedmont Blues set is manufactured in China. To top it off, they taste bad. For the money, you'd be better off buying a Hohner Special 20, Key of C instead. That's what I did. The Special 20 is manufactured in Germany. The Hohner Special 20 is about the same price and works well right out of the box. I recommend buying one good harmonica instead of 7 poor quality harmonicas. You get what you pay for. Get the Special 20.

A nice feature (hence the 2 star rating) is that it fits into the f-hole.  Other pickups are glued to the instrument body.  It was nice that the $7 pickup could be easily removed without damaging a several thousand dollar violin... so, no harm no foul.
If you have 7 bucks to throw away give it a try. Some reviews state that this thing is amazing but, that was not my experience.  If you can't afford the price save your money for that latte'  ; )",0
3067,"Some harmonicas are shipped within a display box, blister pack, or something like that. This one was just shipped in its plastic case. Plastic cases are vented. Air can get through, and dust. After a short time of playing, I noticed that I kept inhaling dust and who knows what else. Irritated my throat. Slightly odd taste. This might be a great harmonica. Some people really love it. I got a dusty one. Bleah. I really hope some vendors ship these within sealed boxes or other packaging.

I am very fortunate that Amazon granted me a refund. Most harmonica sellers don't do that. I reported the harmonica as defective... which, in my opinion, it was. I ordered 5 other harps in the same month, and didn't have any problems with them not being clean. In my opinion, an unclean harmonica is a defective harmonica.

So I got a refund. Thanks, Amazon, for that.

Compared to the other harmonicas I ordered.. various Hohner models and one made by Seydel, this one just felt really cheap. Not especially well-made. Like the Seydel Blues Session models, this one is ergonomic, and lots wider than most harps. Some folks might find the size and width to be uncomfortable at first. It will take some adjustment.

The Seydel I bought was a more expensive model than this one. I paid $60 for a Blues Session Steel. Bought one from Amazon. Big difference between the Seydel and the Suzuki, but that's to be expected, considering the large difference in price.

This Suzuki harp is meant to compete with the cheaper Blues Session Standard (not the Blues Session Steel) made by Seydel, and the Hohner Special 20. I don't know how it compares to the Blues Session Standard, since I don't own one. But, I do own a Special 20, and like the feel and tone of that one more than the Bluesmaster. Plus, the Special 20 was shipped in a display box, not just a plastic case, and was clean when I got it. No issues.

Maybe this is a great harp, but I'm not going to take the chance on ordering another one. I'll stick with Hohner and Seydel.",0

What tends to happen is that my solos are too low over the loop and I have to turn up the volume on the guitar, which I then have to readjust later. I thought this pedal would be a good solution in that I could set a solo volume and then kick it on for when I'm playing rhythm. Unfortunately, when I kicked on the pedal it immediately robbed all the tone from my guitar and made it sound dark and muddy. I ended up sending it back.

I picked this over the Ditto due to the stereo out feature which allows me to run my Alesis drum machine into the looper and out to a bass cab through one in/out and then my pedal board and guitar through the other in/out. I can loop a drum track that plays only through the bass amp and then create guitar/keyboard loops over the top that only play through my guitar amp, very clever.

Defective switch bypassed, the unit works fine, especially for an active bass signal.

I doubt that this defect is super-common, but the fact that it made it out the door at all implies that there is little attention paid to quality control, so I have to down-rate the product a bit.

3096,"NECK
The nut was missing. I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....

BODY
The shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.

PICKUPS and ELECTRONICS
The electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.

STRING AND BRIDGE
The bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.

PICKGUARD
I didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.

FINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
At the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender....
So if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford:
- new pickups and electronics,
- new bridge,
- new strings,
- good finishing and lacquer technique

My suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....",0

3105,Doesn't really do anything for the microphone except boost volume. Some noise till you push the 1st button down. To me it just seems like a VU meter to measure clipping with a little volume boost on microphone. Having Microphone Volume problems it might solve that issue for you...,0
3106,"These are advertised as ""hand made.""  And they sure are.  As in poor quality control, poor consistency, poor construction, poor sound.  They have all the benefits of a product made by some teenager in his basement.

Quality control is poor.  One of four shredded upon installation before even coming up to tune.  And, yes, I followed the ""manufacturer's"" instructions to the letter (use pliers to make a sharp 90 degree bend, then cut).  25% waste is not acceptable.

The sound is poor.  These have a tinny sound inconsistent with quality bass strings.  Alas, this is not consistent from string to string, most noticeable on the third string, but also evident on the second.  Not the rich tone of a true round wound, nor the thump of a flat.  As stated, the consistency is poor.  It would almost be better if all four strings had the same tone, because then we could just say they were poorly designed.  These are poorly manufactured (""hand made"").

The feel is poor.  I disagree with those who say these need lubrication to handle slides properly.  These feel like mushy round wound strings, although sliding is no problem.  Still, it's hard to get the left hand feel necessary for decent playing.  Basically, they're cheap round wounds dipped in paint.  I haven't played them long enough to see whether the paint stays on or not.  Other reviewers suggest it just chips off after a few days.

These strings only have two things going for them.  First, they are billed as lasting upwards of double the life of an uncoated string.  Maybe so, but given how nasty they feel and sound, that's hardly a benefit.  Second, they look great, especially on my black JT Viola bass.  Shame we have to listen to them as well.  If you want cool looking strings you can hang on the wall, you'll love these.  If you want acceptable sounding bass strings, these are not the way to go.  So let's just look at them and not play them.",0
3107,"I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month. The first set's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped. Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C; everything fine. Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way ""snap!""  it broke. I do not recommend these strinags, particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth, even slowly without breaking. For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings. The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright, clear, soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball.",0
3108,"Update: both my cables have had serious problems on the XLR end. The XLRs can stick inside the microphone, making you take apart or cut the cable to get the microphone off. Sadly, I am revising my rating to one star as this product may cause problems when recording or damage the microphone connector. The fix is to replace the XLR connector.
This cable has gotten some pretty good reviews, and it's a decent cable, but it isn't a five star product. I'll say what's good, what's not so good, and, as always, you decide :)
If you are buying this cable, which is sort of in the middle, you have to decide whether it is worth spending a few more dollars for Canare or Gotham, which are the two best brands (sorry, Mogami.....). Or, do you buy a reel of bulk cable and solder your own? No, don't bother, it isn't worth it. Or do you buy the super cheap one? No, you don't want that, I assure you.
First off, yes, it definitely is worth upgrading to the Canare, it's just a few dollars more and it is definitely better, since I took it apart and stripped it down I had a good look inside. The sheathing is OK, but, again, not top of the line. Now, that's not to say that this LyxPro is not good, it's OK, and, on the plus side, the soldering was better than average. A bad solder joint is a common problem, so, it's well soldered, and that's good. Inside you will find double cables for each channel, neatly soldered together in two pairs of two, which is the ""quad"" feature. The quad wiring gives you some extra protection against noise, and if you break one of those tiny wires, well, there's another one right there. But the Canare is just all-around better. If you want the best, get the Gotham, but it's more expensive.
So the bad news is that this cable kinks like mad, and that's just really annoying. In fairness, it's tough to make a flexible quad cable, because you have all those extra wires in there, and they act like springs. The XLRs on this cable and, in the case, quarter inch plugs are decent; the XLRs are in fact clones of Neutrik connectors and they look identical, there's just a tiny difference at the strain relief end. Don't be impressed by the gold plating--the solder is not gold so you are just creating a tiny electrical charge; it isn't an upgrade of any kind, and it doesn't affect the sound, but it looks nice.
If I had to do it again, I would have bought the Canare simply because I know this cable is just going to get more and more kinks, but it's decent, so I will keep it.",0
3109,I gave this a shot but didn't really like it. It's a great concept but I found it difficult to switch from one cord to another while trying to strum the instrument. The software is good and I think someone could learn a lot from it but I would get more from a full size guitar with the same concept.,0

I contacted MAGIX at the beginning of last year, they actually defended their product by negating my concern about clipping sounds and edit erasures within their product.

I have 6 tuners, and I can't keep enough batteries on hand to satisfy their voracious appetites.  I'd pass on this one.",0
3119,"Granted that at this price there isn't a great surprise that quality is bad, but some things do need said of these.

They are small. They are brittle and easy to break, and the material doesn't lend itself to this application in my opinion. The twist lock comes undone very easily. Thicker straps are very difficult to attach with these, and end up coming undone or popping it off across the room.

Most importantly, they fit very awkwardly on all of my guitars (many Deans, a couple of Epiphones, and a Gibson SG). The strap pegs on all of my guitars weren't accepting of these strap locks, even without a strap attached.

The primitive and ineffective method of 'securing' these locks is to twist the top part, which closes an opening over the strap peg (think of salt shakers with the twist lid).

If you're anything like me and value your guitar far too much to let it fall to the ground just to save a few bucks, don't buy these.",0

I was afraid this might be the case, but I really couldn't tell from the pictures or description on Amazon, so I took a gamble.  How much trouble would it have been to affix some kind of thin fabric backing to the rear face of this product? Yes, I know it's just a piece of plastic being scraped across the metal frets, probably not hurting anything, but I don't like it. It feels like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. I baby my guitar and I want the whole experience to be luxurious and soft and feel like being swaddled in cushiony billowy pillows of guitar love. Nothing scratchy please. If they would release this product with a soft backing, I'd buy that!

These picks made a scraping sound on the strings that absolutely ruined the sound. They also scraped up the strings, so now I have to change them. They are more made of tin than stainless steel and are relatively light and thin (for a metal pick). Overall, these picks were not a good deal, and of bad quality.",0
3195,"This strap is touted as being stretch-resistant material for consistent tension. The way PureSound went about designing this product made it stretch-resistant per the design goal, but also too inflexible to use for general purpose use.

A better solution, and one that is equally stretch-resistant, is to use grosgrain ribbon. This solution has the following advantages over this product (and similar products from competing companies):

- Strong and stretch-resistant

- Thin. Allows the snare wire plate to set closer to the drum head and resonate with minimal interference because of the thinness.

- Flexible. You don't have to struggle to thread it through the butt and throw-off assemblies.

- Significantly cheaper. A typical roll, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grosgrain-Ribbon-5-8-Inch-30-Yards-White/dp/B007K0TK04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grosgrain Ribbon 5/8 Inch 30 Yards White</a>&nbsp;costs about the same as these four straps, but should provide enough straps to almost last a lifetime. Do the math.

My reasons for using 5/8"" grosgrain ribbon when most plastic snare straps are 3/8"" wide is because it perfectly fits every snare drum throwoff and butt I've used it with. The thinner, 3/8"" ribbon can cock when threading it through the strainer and butt clamps, skewing your wires.

If you use straps to attach your snare wires avoid this and other plastic straps and use the grosgrain ribbon. It you are skeptical, do a little research on the web and you will find an overwhelming number of posts and articles that validate this.

Note: I am pro-PureSound in every ever respect. I use their snare wires almost exclusively and have reviewed a number of models here, giving all of them five stars and glowing reviews.",0

The unit itself worked okay at first but right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed on. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly mounted and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me next week to order parts. Guess what, no call to me was placed. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.",0
3204,Cheap quality. Both pieces were bent and every single edge was razor sharp from the press. I had to spend a little time on them with my Dremel tool to smooth down the edges. I would have liked these to be made out of a thinner piece of metal. The top of the frets is barely exposed. I was unable to use these to protect the fretboard and the binding while filing down the fret ends on the neck of a project guitar. I ended up using tape.

3216,"I started with a used Live 2 a couple of years ago which worked fine for a while.  It began generating noise that I could not get rid of.  I also wanted the momentary action of the Live 3 harmony switch so the Live 2, noise and all went into the closet.  I purchased a Live 3 and it worked fine for a while. After about a 5 gigs I'd do an equipment setup check and rehearsal and everything would be fine.  Then I'd get to the gig and there would be issues.  No or very low output from the unit.  The last straw was when I was setting up for a gig a few weeks ago and all I could get out of the Live 3 was a high noise level and very low signal level.

I got a hold of the contracted Digitech tech assistance via the Digitech web site and spent a week (I live in Japan and a 13 hour time difference from U.S.) doing email troubleshooting with him finally telling me I had a defective unit.  Both the Live 2 and Live 3 have the same problem which is an indicator of some sort.

Because I really like the concept, I dumped some more bucks into the Live 5 and am completely satisfied with that.  I can't speak to longevity yet but sound quality out of the 5 is much better than the 3.

It's the only pedal I am using--going straight into a Blues Jr. And sometimes a vintage Twin reverb.  It does cut through nicely for solos but otherwise just has that highly processed cold tone that I don't care for.  Maybe I need to get a truly transparent boost instead.

3249,"I like this design because it fits in the outside pocket of my tenor sax case and accommodates two accessory pegs.  However, the design could have been better.  To hold a tenor, you have to remove the wingnut and screw from the flip down cradle that holds the bell and move the assembly further down the stem.  Easy.  But now the stand does not fold up as compactly because the cradle now hits the sliding arm.  I ground down the sliding arm at the contact point so that it would compress better, but this wouldn't be a problem with better design.  If this were the only concern, I would have given the stand a 4 star rating.  It holds the tenor as securely as my Hercules stand.  I would have appreciated a cord lock on the carry bag, but that was an easy addition.

My concern is quality of construction.  The screws and wingnuts were not well machined and are loose.  I suppose it doesn't matter that the clarinet peg is a little floppy, but going cheap on the visible stuff is never  a good sign.  There is a weld that connects the attachment point for the two side arms to slider for the upright part of the stand.  This allows you to open and close the stand with one smooth motion.  You grip the two side arms and push them to the body.  There is a wing nut screw that adds some tension and that is what keeps the stand from collapsing.  With a minimum of trial and error, I found the right amount of tension so that I didn't need to tighten anything when I opened the stand.  Today the weld failed.  Not only is it now more complicated to open the stand, but I have to be careful not to open the legs too wide.  Plus, now I have to tighten the bottom wing nut or the stand will fold up under the weight of the sax.  I now have some duct tape on the stand which I can use as an emergency stop but I hope it doesn't come to that.  The stand has stopped being worry free.  I'll think about taking it to a welding shop to get it repaired but that may end up being more expensive than getting a replacement.  I've had the stand six months.

I was going to make a soprano sax peg - the arm accepts a standard 1/4 inch screw.  Now I'm not sure I'll be using the stand much longer.",0
3250,"Firstly this product has a great price and so for those of us on a budget it is excellent.

However that comes at a cost: the keys feel like they connect to the board below the same way pc keyboard keys do but the over-sized keys mean that if you don't hit them exactly in the middle they won't actually press the little black circle that activates the button. This can lead to delays when trying to play a chord (3 keys at once.)

I love Korg products and this is a great product for the cost, but if you need to play a note that is time sensitive you may want something with regular keyboard keys. The product looks very cool next to my keyboard.

3259,"Really disappointed.  I found out why my Jackson Dinky was having trouble keeping tune.  I decided to upgrade the tremelo and I put a floyd rose original on it.  The problem turned out not to be the stock tremelo, instead they had mis- and over-drilled both holes for the locking nut, and only the lower screw had any bite into wood at all (~1/3 turn, just barely holding the nut on).  Very disappointed in the quality of this guitar, and I won't be buying another one.  It arrived with multiple blemishes on the face paint, also had drops of over-paint run that were never sanded down.  Two of the tuners lost their plastic washers within a week.  Also, it has cheap brass frets that leave slivers galore in your fingertips.  I was always walking around with tweezers in my pocket so I could pull the metal slivers out of my left hand.  I got sick of it so I decided to refret it, and that's when I found the root problems with the neck/nut mount.  If you are planning on actually playing it, you will have to refret it.  I did mine with silver nickel jumbo's and it's much, much better.  IT's SOOOO worth it to save and get a guitar that doesn't have brass frets.  They are aweful, unless you're a complete massochist.

I ended up completely re-doing my guitar out of disgust (and some boredom).  I straightened the mis-aligned neck to body joint, ripped out the crappy electronics and wired in a set of Duncan Blackouts (AHB-1).  I re-fretted it, put in Grover tuners and patched the old holes (had a set of black mini rotomatics that were burning a hole in my toolbox), reconstructed the neck wood and re-drilled the nut holes, properly this time.  Put on the Floyd Rose original and a 32mm big brass block and it's now very playable and quite enjoyable, but it's definitely not a Dinky DKA-M any more.  (Oh yeah, they also over-drilled the floyd rose body mounting holes, so they were consistently screwing everything up that required a power tool.)

One side note:  For many, myself included, the volume knob is mounted in a postion that my hand hits it when strumming, which eventually causes damage to the pot, but also can have you accidentally changing the volume frequently.  When I decided to put in the Blackouts , I moved the volume pot back to a hole that I drilled and routed an inch closer to the tone knob, and it's fantastic, not in the way at all.  I did have to reconstruct the wood where the old hole was but after the paint job it's completely invisible now.

I have more hours in to this than I care to attempt to quantify, but looking back it wasn't worth it. Granted, it looks, plays and sounds great now, but I'll never get all those hours back.  Save your money, get a nicer guitar that has these things done right, you'll surely thank yourself.  It'll also have a higher resale value than a souped up chinese jobber like mine.

In short, it should never have left the factory.",0
3260,"Seriously people!  You could get a really nice powered speaker for 1/4 the cost of this.  This is marketing hype.  If you think it's great, then you have never used a modern high quality powered speaker like a QSC, Meyer, JBL, etc

First of all, this claims to be a line array.  A line array is designed to throw the sound farther, but they don't tell you that a line arrays ability to throw sound farther is limited by its length.  The bose is 87 which means its a line array to about 320Hz.  But what does that mean?

If you have the system dialed to sound good at one spot as you move closer, the bottom four octaves (20Hz to 320Hz) get louder.  However, as you move farther away those frequencies disappear.  The reason is that the line array phenomena is that it cuts the amount a sound decays in half as you move away.  However any sound lower in pitch than the frequency (2X the frequency whose wavelength is the length of the array) in this case 320Hz doesnt get that benefit.

Oh wait,  They say its easy to move  A 45lbs bass module, plus the 24 lbs power stand, plus the bottom half of the array at 18lbs and the top half of the array at 16 lbs totals to 103 lbs!  By comparison a traditional speaker stand (Ultimate Stand TS-90B $90) weighs 8lbs, and a QSC K8,10,and 12 1000W powered speaker weigh 27,32,or 41lbs.  Thats half as much!

So they are supposed to be really loud  According to their comparison system the L1 M2 with a B2 module produces 115dB continuous, and 121dB peak.  The same QSC K8,10&12s peak at 127,129,or 131Hz.  Remember folks every time you add 3dB is twice as much power, so the K8 is 4X as powerful and the K12 is over 8 times as powerful.

Then there is the cost  This system costs $3,198.00  For that you could buy a pair of K12s, Ultimate Stands, and a 8 Channel Touchmix mixer for  $2,680.00 and have a real PA for less money that weighs less.  JBL, and may others have similar systems.

I wrote this review because I am a musician who has a sound company.  I am forever tired of going to venues where they have this junk, and expect us to sound good.  I don't work for or receive anything from QSC, JBL, or anyone else here.  I just know what the professional companies use, and abuse day in and day out.  I own some K12s and love them.",0

Things that are wrong with it. 1. Its made of very cheap crappy wood that doesn't have any sustain. 2. The finish is the worst finish i've ever seen on a guitar. 3. The neck is rough and unfinished which makes it hard to slide your hand up and down. 4. same with the fret board. 5. even when in tune this guitar sounds very bad with no amp 6. even when in tune this guitar sounds like crap through an amp.

3271,"This pedal can make some nice sounds and it has a lot of options, but...

Maybe it's just mine, but there is a constant (albeit quiet) digital whine coming from this pedal even in bypass mode. I can clearly hear the whine tick and change pitch as I scroll through presets (again, even in bypass) so I know that the origin is this pedal and not interference somewhere in the chain. The signal going into the pedal is gated, and when I remove the pedal from the chain it the output is completely silent.

On top of this the infinite reverb, which is really the primary reason I chose this over a Holy Grail or other reverb pedal, isn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped. Unless you have the blend all the way wet (which doesn't really sound all that pleasing most of the time), it really just sounds like noise in the background.

This, paired with the fact that I just can't get about half of the settings to sound good led me to return this pedal. If I had paid under $100 for this pedal it would have been worth it, but it's hard to justify a $200+ price tag for something that causes silly annoyances like this.",0

While this is clearly man-made, it's neither strong nor durable, in fact it came with a soft spot in it already, likely where someone pressed on it too hard with a finger or thumb.  Dennis Wick makes a far better mute, the DW5531, that doubles as both a cup and straight mute.  While it's more expensive, it's far better made and offers both standard mutes that every trumpet player should have.

3291,"I bought this for old school Wah (Hendrix/Clapton) .I tested it on a Tele and Strat. I did not test it with my SG. When I was young I bought the original Thomas Organ version Clyde. I also now have a Dunlop Crybaby GCB-95 too from many years ago. The Vox Wah sound  is very good, making a very good Wah Wah sound. Its range seems less. Also compared to the Dunlop it sounds weak, thin, and harsh but more vocal. I AB'd it and I just can't use this Wah because it sounds so thin as if some one chopped all the roundness off. It is a little more accurate than the fat sounding GCB-95. The Dunlop sounds round and big and is consider the standard these days. So I like the Vox Wah sound but it is not enough to override the thinness of it. I returned it.  If two people played side by side, GCB-95 and the VOX, people would think something is wrong with the Vox. Now if you are using humbuckers, the results may be different..  However for modern music, many other model Dunlops would be more appropriate as modern day Wah is not the same as old school Wah.  I do know that this Wah is VERY popular so read other people's reviews and watch/listen to online videos. Many people however buy it for its looks because they saw Hendrix use one and worse still, they might take off one foot because they notice Hendrix sometimes had only three rubber feet on it, probably only because he lost one. I bought this because I actually had one of the original  VOX Wahs, unfortunately, at least from what I remember, it is not close enough. I really wish I liked it.

And BTW, Dunlop makes both their and Vox's Wah Wahs so it is a design decision on how they sound. In fact most of it is the same.

When considering a Wah, you might want to get one with an adjustable output and other adjustments. When you look at signature models remember you do not have all the other equipment the artist has.

The low cost Dunlop, is a very good choice for most. You may decide even if you want a Wah at all. Using a Wah is not just rocking your foot, you have to have feel - if you don't you sound like an idiot and a poser. That is one reason so many used ones are available.

My final decision on a Wah was to go a more expensive route because I wanted to get it over with and get the perfect Wah for me once and for all. I wanted what I had when I was young as  that sound is in my head.  I chose to get a complete drop-in replacement with buffer from Area51 because I already had a Wah to put it in. Otherwise I would have just bought a complete Area51 Wah from him. He makes his own inductors the very important part of the tone. For most, and I want to be honest, a basic Dunlop Crybaby is fine and low cost and Amazon's price is as good as anyone else  plus you have Amazon backing up their sale. For those who spend a lot of time seeking the ""tone"" the difference is very noticeable and worth the added expense if you can afford  an Area 51.  The standard Area 51 Wah is perfect as it is, if you want the Thomas Organ Clyde old-school sound. Once you hear an Area 51 Wah, it is an education.  This is what a Wah is as far as I am concerned. It is also super well made.

In closing, I want to advise you again  to read other reviews because some people love these Vox Wahs.",0
3292,A friend of mine gave me a pair of these cymbals because he was cleaning out his house.  The sound is so bad on these things it is embarrassing.

It seems a separate pre-amp would have been needed, between the piezo and the main mixer-amp. I removed it, and went with a different idea for amplifying my mandolin - a Ukelele-type piezo which I bonded under the mandolin top in a certain place, and installed the associated small, active  pre-amp (with 9v battery, EQ and volume controls) into the side of the mandolin, and added an output jack for the amp cord.

With the guide on as received, the E string actually contacted the guide and in the first position it buzzed.  I tried everything I could and finally sliced off about 1/2"" of the guide where it goes under the E string.  That fixed the buzz but the overall feel of my instrument was poor with the guide on.  I have since replaced it with thin lines cut from label stock and it works much better.  On the positive side, I do like that the guide coordinates with color coded sheet music for early learners.

I had a stellar review for this mic here, but I deleted that, because if a mic doesn't work, it sucks. I only ordered 2 and the 2nd one was dead. A 50/50 chance that this mic will not operate is unacceptable. Do not buy it.
It's very attractive, a mic touted as being as good as or better than the Shure it's imitating, being offered for only 30-ish bucks. But you get what you pay for.
Lesson learned; most studio hobbyists need a handful of condenser and dynamic mics.  Go ahead and spend the extra couple of dozen bucks for a Shure SM-57. You'll be buying solid gear which will operate, because they're made like a safe.  I haven't tried the 39-cent Pyle versions of these, and I was about to order a couple; but, Nay.

All other settings yielded either subtle or horrible tones (nothing subjective about it -- it sounded like my speaker was blown!), some that hurt my ears and I feared would damage my new tube amp, which is loud at 3 or 4, so I need to roll the volume back on my guitar, which makes this pedal pretty ineffective for me. Didn't have high expectations for this, but they weren't met. Returning it. Not worth it for one OK setting. Might work well if you usually plug directly into a computer or a quiet amp with your guitar's volume all the way up. Might one day try the regular Q-Tron.

It's also nearly impossible to keep at least 1-2 keys from being plagued by horrible buzzing and dead notes.  If you're curious about playing a kalimba/thumb piano and want to see if it's a instrument that you'd like to get into, then by all means, stay away from this one.

3337,"I love this pedal and also have the Ditto X4, and Hall of Fame pedals..  Huge fan of TC Electronic's stuff but a year after I bought the flashback the tap tempo stopped keeping accurate tempo.  It would speed up or slow down just enough to throw off the timing if you have looped it after a minute of so of plaing which would really mess with you playing live.  This almost drove me crazy trying to troubleshoot it but it is definitely the tap tempo function only that is failing.  Love their product but I'm pretty discouraged as I used this ALL the time but can't afford to buy another one.  ..Do you hear the violins in the distance for me??  :)",0

The DDM4000 is a cheap knock off of the pioneer DJM800 because of the midi connection and the similar features. The quality is absolutely horrible and I would not recumbent this mixer to anyone weather an beginner or pro dj. This is by far the worst dj product that I have ever bought. This product is straight weak and we should ship all of these mixers back to Germany and cut their products off until they can create a product with at least the quality of a numark product. Do not buy this mixer. Own 7 mixers from all different brands and I love them all. I know features and I know quality.

3350,"Very loud hum when press power button and could hardly hear Huntington KB61 tones. Too bad because if no hum noise this would be a 5 star item . Before I bought from Amazon I read several reviews and none mentioned turn on noise. I looked at pamphlet troubleshooting section and it said ""turn on noise is common"" so design problem big time here! The keys worked fine and were not as poor quality as some reviews stated. Useless to go further because of overiding noise . I would not recommend this to anyone let alone a beginner or child who would get very discouraged with a keyboard like this. Yamaha and Casio have very good reliable 61 full key keyboards that cost around $100.00. Not a bad price since they will last about 10 years or more! I have a great Yamaha PSR keyboard I have had for at least 10 years. No mechanical or tone quality problems at all.

3351,"I've owned a set for these for about 3 years. The housing is zinc and wears out pretty quick and I'm using Ernie Ball Slinkys on a short scale neck so there is very little stress.

What caught my attention was the tuners started feeling like they were grinding and not smooth. I've only owned these about 3 years.

I pulled the low-E tuner and the gear is sloppy loose because the zinc housing is worn out where the worm gear rides.
The thrust washer failed.
The teeth are worn abnormally.

Grover has a life time guarantee but the guarantee is for ""failure"" and you have to pay to mail the failed tuners to them plus include a $7.50 check so they can ""repair or replace"" as needed.

3352,"Fail offer by Yamaha. Having been pleased with their Soprano (especially the ECODEAR version), I fully expected the same level of quality with their Sopranino. It is not even close. Different design entirely (so it fails to match aesthetically as well), clogs VERY easily, and does NOT have a curved windway like Yamaha's quality instruments. This makes the 2nd octave much more difficult to play. Not a fan of the tone either. If you want a high quality Sopranino look to the Aulos Sopranino, it is made with the same quality as their larger instruments, has a great tone, and is a joy to play.",0
3353,"I bought this so that I could try a few additional tunings for some new songs I'm working on. My band does everything in either Drop C/D Standard, or on a Standard 7 string (B Standard/Drop A). Among other reasons, some riffs/melodies I have in my head just sound better with a Low F# or G at the bottom, so I wanted to try this pedal as an option to get there without needing a third guitar live.

The sound quality is mostly fine. Obviously, as you step more then 4 semitones away from the original signal, it starts to sound fake, but that is true of all pitch shifter pedals and plug-ins. There are some odd sounds in the mid-range of my guitar's scale, but that's not why I'm returning this pedal.

I'm returning it because:
The ""Detune"" function literally just makes your guitar slightly flat or slightly sharp. According to the manual, the adjustment is between -30 CENTS and +30 CENTS (not semtones; cents!). By the way, none of these numbers actually appear on the pedal itself, so if you're trying to set it to, say, 10 cents down, good luck with that. If this is something you can put to use, more power to you. It would be nice if they labeled the knob that controls it, so that you actually know what setting you're on!

The ""Pitch Shift"" function (what I bought it for) has seemingly arbitrary preset intervals that it can use, and you can't choose any other intervals. The options are -24, -12, -7, -5, -2, -1, +3, +4, +5, +7, +12, and +24 semitones. And once again, these numbers are nowehere to be found on the pedal itself, so you either have to memorize that ridiculous sequence, or carry the manual around with you at all times.

Actually, after checking the manual again, there is literally NOTHING that this pedal does, that actually corresponds to the numbers on the ""Pitch"" knob! So why are the numbers even there? +6 and -6? Why are you two even printed on this pedal? The only ""6"" anywhere in the manual is in the ""Harmonist"" mode, and the ""-6"" and ""+6"" on the pedal don't even correspond to the 6th interval; you set the knob on ""-6"" or ""+6"" to get an OCTAVE interval. *facepalm*

So, basically, you can go DOWN 1 semitone, but you can't go UP 1. You can go UP 3 semitones, but you can't go DOWN 3. If you're in standard tuning, and you want to try Pantera's D-flat tuning, or (old) In Flames's C Standard tuning, well, you can't! If you're in Drop D, and want to play some Five Finger Death Punch (Drop B) or new In Flames (Drop B-flat)...you can't! If you prefer to tune to E-flat, but want to get back to standard quickly...you can't! If you play a lot of music in Drop C/D Standard, but want to jam with someone who plays in standard...you can't! It makes no sense! But I guess Behringer knows best which intervals you should be using as a guitarist. So drop your guitar by two octaves and shut up!

And yes, I know I can just re-tune the guitar myself to get the tuning I want. I'd like to remind you that, if I were going to do that, then why did I bother buying a pitch shifter pedal? So I can re-tune to D Standard, THEN drop down 2 semitones with the pedal? Seriously, think about that for a second.

Looking forward to trying a different pedal with more flexibility in pitch shifting options (ie, a pedal that HAS flexibility in pitch shifting options).",0
3354,"This thing is made of the cheapest plastic I have ever seen! I would not want to step on it to turn it on or off. I think it would break! Changing the battery is a ""real"" pain. You must remove the top plastic part to change/install the battery and I thought It was going to break. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!
The repeat rate knob works ""BACKWARDS"" You turn it in the opposite direction of what you should to get the desired effect you want.
It is not suppose to work that way so it is defective. It was not worth paying to send it back. It works, just not correctly!
The delay is fair to poor but it was a cheap pedal. I don't turn it on and off. I set it and just leave it on.

My advice; If you are going to be ""Stomping"" this pedal on and Off I suggest you buy a better, more robust pedal.",0
3355,"For what this pick is, it definitely does the job.  However, this pick is very wobbly and bendy.  I pick very hard, and I need a relatively hard pick for accurate timing and punch.  It feels like I'm playing with Play Doh.  I'd probably switch over to these if they were made of a harder material, like carbon fiber or even just the standard Tortex plastic.  I know about the Jazz III, but I don't like those.  I assume these are for the more casual player who does more ""strummy"" playing, not for a Metal guy like myself.",0
3356,"Our worship team has coined these ""Might Be Brights"" due to their unreliability.  I originally had this as 2 stars because they were bright enough, but I just can't count on these anymore.

We often have to flick them with our fingers to keep them turned on.  It's not uncommon to see 3 or 4 of these clipped to each music stand, because the first couple pairs just didn't want to work that day.

3368,"Don't drop this thing on your toe!  This is a seriously heavy hunk of metal that secures very poorly to a microphone boom via a single, small threaded screw, capped by a flimsy plastic hand twist.  Easily falls off the boom during attachment, and when it hits the floor, the plastic hand twist immediately breaks off (mine broke off during my first attachment).  It's just as well, however, as a pliers or a socket wrench is absolutely required to tighten the screw hard enough to keep the weight from moving about and/or falling off.  This boom weight is a good idea....but an extremely poor design with no attention whatsoever given to weight symmetry within its own shape.  Most importantly,  a much more substantial bolt is needed to keep this monster weight from falling off and killing one of your pets!  And don't even think about repositioning it once it's finally bolted into place.  The position of everything on your boom has to be carefully aligned AFTER the weight is completely secured, or the entire top boom will rotate to the weights asymmetrical balance point, no matter how much you tighter the boom's securing bolt.  On a positive note, however, you could probably hang off the other end of the boom without tilting the rig.

  One final caution.......the final total weight on the top boon may be so heavy with this weight plus mics, iPads, cables etc., that the mic stand's center securing nut may not be strong enough to prevent slow collapse of the entire upper rig into the bottom pole (especially with a flimsy mic stand).  To stop that dogged tendency of the upper pole to collapse,I had to tighten mine so much that I stripped my stand's metal secure nut, and wound up having to purchase an entirely new (and stronger) stand.  Just carrying my keyboard IPad stand is now an aerobic exercise at every gig....but that baby don't fall over no more!!",0

3373,"Not impressed. I bought this amp based on other reviews I read and am disappointed and feel I wasted my money. I dislike it so much that I bought another brand within a few months and am much happier with that amp. In my opinion It's difficult to get any variety of clean sounds out of this amp. In fact there are even you tube videos people have made on how to get a clean sound out of it. What does that tell you? My one HUGE complaint is that, unless I am doing something wrong, there is no setting to bypass all preset tones and simply put this amp in manual mode to make the exact sound you want. As I understand this amp, you have to choose one of the preset sounds and you can alter that sound. But most of the preset ones are distortion type sounds and I like a cleaner type of tone. The amp I just bought to replace this one has a manual mode that bypasses all the preset tones, so I can tailor a sound to exactly what I want. I don't Have to choose one of the preset sounds and then try to work with that limitation. I recommend you try this amp out in person before buying it based solely on reviews. I didn't do that and should have. When I visit my local guitar store the amps I see people playing most are Line 6 amps. I spent $100 more on a different amp and I think $300 is the minimum you should spend to get a great sounding amp. I think The extra $100 I spent is reflected in the sound quality.",0
3374,"I realized a problem with these ... and other review sites will tell you the same. They do nothing for the neck of your guitar because they seal the moist sponge on the inside of your guitar body. It is worth your while to check out a type that does not seal the sound hole, held between a couple of the strings, etc. Some have said that, because they seal the soundhole, these are better suited for a guitar you keep out of its case, but again, if your air is dry enough to need one (40 to 50% Relative Humidity is the recommended range for acoustic guitars), then your neck will still get no benefit. NOTE on the harder plastic ring that some complain about - you NEED that to be resting on the TOP of the guitar around the soundhole - it separates the softer flexible plastic from your guitar's finish - to prevent damage to your finish.",0

I tried playing and noticed the first 3 frets just buzzed when using the lowest string (High E), can't even play the guitar! I guess I have to take it to a local store and have it adjusted then pay for it out of my own pocket! What a JOY! Would be nice if these products we buy online would actually deliver in working condition more often then not! But I guess it's my lesson to learn, and I still haven't learned that particular lesson!

UPDATE! After taking this guitar to a local music store the technician stated that the neck was warped and there is no fixing it, so I contacted Music123 and spoke to their customer service rep (William), he was very polite and sincere in his help! He sent me a return lable, started the process of having my money refunded back to my credit card, set up an account for me and he is selling me the same player pack (this time in ebony color) at a 15% discount! He also stated that their technicians will verify the guitar is in working order prior to delivery! So I gave them 5 stars for the excellent customer service and also the player pack is a great deal and the guitar is beautiful, I just got a bad one from the factory and well as we all know, stuff happens! So anyway, when I get the new player pack I will update again with the condition of the contents! Hopefully since I went directly through Music123 everything will be in perfect working order! Tune in next time, same bat channel!

Just wanted to update since I sent the original player pack back to Music123, I was given a 15% discount if I went directly through Music123 and was assured that the guitar being sent would be verified by their service tech to make sure there is nothing wrong BEFORE they sent the new one out to me! Well I just recieved the new Epiphone player pack and now the pickup doesn't work on the new accoustic! I would NOT recommend ANYTHING from Music123! Pathetic quality control and after calling AGAIN for a return lable I found out they never had a tech verify this guitar was in working condition!

To its credit, this guitar is fairly lightweight and did sound pretty good.  If you are looking for a decent beginner's guitar, or if you are not an advanced player, or if you just want a guitar for general purposes, this might be really good for you.

So back to my girlfriend ... once she brought me this as a present I - as u can already tell - I loved her even more , if there is such a thing as ""more"" since I already loved her to the fullest . I did NOT touched the little amp the first night . I decided to practice discipline and savor it for the next night , I knew she had to work ( she's a very successful bartender ) so I knew I had the whole night to spend it with the other big love of my life ( the little sexy Marshall ).. ha ha , yes I felt a little guilty but hey a man gotta do what a man gotta do .. and the night begun !!! Tam ra tam tam tarammmm tam tam tammmmm!!!!! Fast forward to 3 hours LATER . Anger , frustration , tears , a close to heart attack feeling , anxiety , panic attack followed by depression . I felt betrayed , that thing SUCKED. Horrible is an understatement , horrific ... I tried each and every possible setting ( there's no settings really ), every level of sound , tried different rooms even and of course I tried with 5 different electric guitars , and 1 acoustic with an external pick up ... I tried 3 different guitar cables too. Nothing , nada , kaput ... the sound was a mess , mediocre , like a cheap laptop PC from the 90ies ... so I decided as a last resort to ask for some help . My last resort was of course DENIAL . So I decided to convince myself that this particular unit was a lemon . S***happen I told myself , maybe it's one of those rare occasions , maybe I was the unlucky one so I decided to SECRETLY order another one -fast / one day / expedite delivery , throw this one to the garbage and ""white lie"" to my girlfriend that I loved the amp . I just didn't wanna hurt her feelings since I loved her and I knew all she wanted to do is make me happy although she accidentally served  me one of the worst days of my life . And the 24 hours passed , and yes the new one arrived . And this is where the truth hit me. The new one sounded identically exactly the same . Crappy , cheap , like a 70ies Samsung transistor radio playing AM frequencies . Sad , painful , empty scratchy sound , a mess like a high school physics project went wrong . I decided to keep this one though and not throw it to the garbage since it's rude to throw away a gift . Fast forward couple weeks when my friend Kent that we occasionally throw some guitar jams together showed up to my place with a tiny little black box . It was a micro mini amp called FLY3 from Blackstar .. I remember I said to him , nahhh let's forget about micro crap and let me warm up the tubes from my Burgers and let's mess around and jam . He insisted . I rolled my eyes and I gave up . Ok ok let's give it a try I replied . AND BOY OH BOY , that 3W amp from BLACKSTAR , that FLY3 blew me away .. What a fantastic real true tone and sound came out that box , making the Marshall look even more as joke as it already felt like it is . Then we plugged the Marshall for one last test , and we laughed and we laughed and then put it to sleep . Bottomline , a powerless crappy amp ( comparing with the BLACKSTAR - similar  priced btw ).",0

3409,"I got this tuner as a gift and was excited because i had never owned a vibration tuner. It was a great tuner, worked fine for about 3 days. after that, the screen started flickering and it became harder to tune my guitars. I thought it might have been a battery issue, but when i changed the battery, the problems didn't change. The ""tuning needle"" would jump randomly around, making it impossible to tune. I promptly went to my local music store to talk to a professional about it. He told me that there is only one truly amazing vibration tuner: the SNARK tuner. Desperate for a tuner, i bought it and was amazed. It was very easy to tune with, especially when you are tuning into special tuning. It worked with my Bass, with out having to switch settings and was more visually pleasing than this one. After about a month, i dropped my snark on hard wood floor from a few feet, and the clamp cracked and broke. i pulled the head off and it still works as long as it is touching the instrument.

FINAL VERDICT:
Dont buy this tuner, it is total crap. Buy a SNARK clip on tuner.",0
3410,"Several of the reviews of this amp are of the ""original"" lunchbox electric guitar amp.  A totally different piece of equipment.  I took mine out of the box and even the Fed Ex guy stayed to look at it.  It had a fake woodgrain and it was little and I mean little.  I plugged it in and didn't adjust anything.  It sounded like a megaphone.  It was all mids, no highs and absolutely no bass.  After fiddling with it for about an hour, I got it to stop sounding like a box.  It turned it up and it had loads of distortion.  It just will not handle enough volume to reproduce true acoustic sound.  I owned Trace Acoustic amps for years, so I thought if Trace Elliot could do it, I'd try these out. I wanted to like this amp.  It is NOT a 200 watt amp. Period.  It's a $300.00 toy that might work on your living room but not in a real music venue.  I have played professionally for a long time.  This is not professional quality.  I sent it back and I'll save my money and buy a ""real"" acoustic amp. Save your money too. In full disclosure, after playing this amp about two hours it went out.  It started popping and cracking(louder than I could ever get the guitar), so I moved it to a different receptacle and it kept ""shorting out"".  I am not an angry person and in the course of playing music, over 33 years as a paid musician, I've owned 3 electric guitar amps and 2 acoustic Crate (to run stereo) and 2 Trace Acoustic amps. A 100 watt TA100 and a 200 TA200S.  I buy equipment when something is new and useful.  The ZT acoustic is new.  Useful does not apply.  If you're playing to your friends with NO background noise, this amp will work.  In a real bar situation an emphatic ""NO"".  The people who gave this a 5 couldn't have owned any upscale amps or the reviews would be different.  That and I've never seen someone tell you his new 300+ dollar amp is junk.  They'll quietly return it, but won't fess up to making a huge mistake.  Misinformation about this amp is epidemic.",0
3411,"It takes some getting used to with the wavy sticks, the sticky sticks and the longer sticks, all rolled into a pair of Promark drumsticks.  She tried, really tried, but said they are just too weird for the drum set and the electronic set.  Even drumming on the sofa caused her to grimace before she put these to skins and in her 25 years of playing, I've never seen her make that face.  Of note is that these sticks both had sections of the coating that had already peeled away from the sticks, so that made a not so good first impression.  Had I purchased these from Amazon, I would have returned them as flawed.  That does not affect the integrity of the sound produced by the hickory sticks, but as she put it, let the drummer ding the sticks on her own.  I suspect that she will let the girls try these when she teaches the next Girls Rock session in 2016, but she probably won't pick them up very often herself.",0

Even with treatment, dunlop maintenance kit, lemon oil, etc, the rosewood still look dry and crappy.
I made a Gilmour Red Strat using a gorgeous Mighty Mite vintage tint neck, take a look on my review here in amazon, and now i'm really upset trying to understand why i decided to buy this awful MIM neck.

3417,"I have been using Aquila Red series on my tenor uke for the last 2 years, and though I have been pleased with their performance, thought I'd try something different. Big mistake! The D'Addario Pro-Arte's dramatically reduced the sound and projection - it was as if the sound was muffled. I tried them for three days, thinking that they would 'break in', or that I would get used to them. Didn't work! These are also an extremely 'stretchy' string - I was constantly having to make major tuning adjustments, sometimes every 10 minutes when playing. I had a fresh set of reds, installed them, and I had my instrument back again. I'm staying with the Aquila Red series (unwound)!",0

3421,"I received my package quickly with Prime.

The MIDI enabler that came with it was packaged better.

The QuNexus.. the 180$ midi keyboard was packaged in a mediocre cardboard box. It was not wrapped, and there was nothing else inside of it. There was a spare computer micro USB in the bigger box from Amazon. Talk about first impressions.

I opened the box and pulled out the keyboard, it was covered in little bits of cardboard, like it had been rubbing against the packaging during the 2 day transit. Why didn't they use a basic plastic sheet or bag to make sure it was safe from moisture or even basic cardboard??

Anyways he keyboard had large scuff marks on its soft to the touch underside. I used little soap and water to try to wipe it off but it did not come off.

The unit worked but it was super velocity sensitive at first. My unit didn't even come with an instruction manual so I had to look online for help. The QuNexus edition doesn't even have a Windows 10 version. It's 2017 guys get with the program. The Windows 7 seemed to work but the editor was just ugly and not very intuative. I wish I could hover my mouse over what ""Touch Velocity Threshold"" kind of meant. Like there's a lot of data that the QuNexus is sending but that need to be described for us other folk. Isn't that helpful to have a product that you can understand? The basic instruction manual is a PDF online and it was an okay tool to understand. However some parameters must be set in the editor.

The QuNexus didn't play well with my Oberheim 6 Desktop. It was overly sensitive right of the box, it felt like if I breathed on it, it would shoot up to 127 midi CC note value immediately. The ""pitch Bend"" was awkward and would only ever work if you really put pressure with your thumb and twirled it around, making it unpractical.

The Oberheim 6 had trouble responding to the QuNexus, I guess the big epic analog doesn't respond well to the likes of this keyboard. I tried to work it out in the editor. It I just couldn't get this keyboard to fit in. It felt awkward and somewhat delayed. The note value must go through they're proprietary midi expander (an additional 60$ for a thin sheet of metal and some wiring microchips).

In all I'm just going to settle with the Arturia Keystep. Even though I dislike Arturia and the company for their lack of support on their products, the keystep for about 80$ less just looks so much more appealing and a keyboard you can pull out and start playing.",0

3424,"INITIAL REVIEW: I ordered a GTD Audio model BM-9100 8 channel 600W powered audio mixer which I received earlier than expected and tested it as soon as I unpacked it. I was pleased with both the timely delivery and the performance of the powered pre-amp. I hooked it up to two pairs of the Pro Audio Monitor 1200Cs that I ordered and had arrived at about the same time. I was very impressed at the quality, workmanship, clarity, volume and power of the unit which includes a built-in 7 band graphic equalizer aside from the simpler tone control for highs and lows provided with each of the 8 channel inputs. Along with the stereo power output led indicators, the unit uses two separate master volume controls, one for each of the two stereo output channels (A/B) and a control for the record playback volume. I am by no means a professional DJ or have experience in using this type of professional equipment, but I decided on its purchase after experiencing problems re-cabling the stage equipment that had been in use the night previously provided by a local social club that I belong to. Even without reading the sparse instructions, the well placed dials and plugins were clearly labeled and their used intuitive for those with some home audio equipment knowledge, with one exception ... the use and settings for the special audio effects. Here is where additional instructions in the included manual would have been much appreciated, as is the lack of a list of functional labels to compliment the numerical digital effects selector. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find someone to explain the use of this function to me or find instructions somewhere online. For the price ... if this equipment holds up ... it definitely seems like a decent buy.

FOLLOW UP REVIEW (May 6, 2012): My unit is DEAD!!! The unit began to smoke and burn while in use yesterday morning. I haven't a clue as to why?!!! I must have used it no more than 5 times and a total of 20 hours. What's more ... I have never ever maxed it out ... I've been careful not to push it beyond a quarter of its capable output. Its always been a pampered piece of my equipment collection and have always carefully packed it away between uses. Upon reviewing my initial comments about the unit, I was surprised to find a photo of another model posted on site which I don't recognize. If the difference is merely cosmetic ""Buyer Beware."" As of yet, I don't know what options I may have for repairing or replacing this mixer. I can't seem to get a hold of the manufacturer via the web url. As of now, all I can do is readjust my rating. I am very disappointed with what happened.",0

3426,"Super cheap quality. Can't hold any of my mics. Would return it but it's not worth the hassle. I don't think you can spend less than $80 for an item like this. However, the manufacturer Ohuhu was incredible with customer service and refunding the order. Great company, but this is a poorly made product.",0
3427,The high E began buzzing a week after I bought it. Slowly all the high strings began buzzing. I guess the neck warped. It's a great looking guitar though so I just hung it on my wall for looks.

3435,Cable broke after 3 months during a crucial gig. The design is deeply flawed as it has no metal sleeve below the plug end.

the thing worked for whopping 4 weeks and for this kind of money, very dissapointing...

3440,"These are generally my favorite strings, but I've gotten 3 sets from here that are defective or fake.  I'm not sure if it's just bad stock right now.  I've ordered these many times in the past and only started seeing the bad ones around January 2015.  I alerted Amazon after the second bad set and they briefly stopped selling them while they investigated.

I hesitated to order again, but decided with the recent good reviews that maybe the issues had been resolved

If you're familiar with these strings you know that they look, feel and sound different than uncoated strings. The ones I got were dull sounding and not the same color or feel of the real thing.  Also the packaging was slightly off in color.. sort of faded looking.

I went to guitar center and got a good set, and they price match.  I uploaded a picture which shows the comparison between the correct looking Elixir strings on the right side and the bad set on the left.  I also uploaded pictures of the front and back of the packaging.  The set from Guitar Center is on the right in each picture.  The ones from Guitar Center are custom light because they were out of light, but all of the different types of Elixir acoustic strings at the appeared to have the same background color.

Also, I want to point out that I've bought the Elixir light polyweb from here recently and they were fine.  This problem might be isolated to these specific strings in light Guage.  I haven't tried any others.",0

3443,"I'm sure Mac users have a different story to tell, and hopefully, they will defend the legitimacy of this product themselves. I, however, have tested three of these (I sent it back twice before opting for the refund) on Windows XP x86 and both x86 and 64 bit Windows 7 machines. From my experience, it ran with the least dropouts on XP (when using one input at a time with absolutely no software preamping) and had a nice flat sound. Before getting any further, I'll explain my needs. Simply enough, I want to run four vocals, two guitars, one bass, midi keys, and a spdif drumset coming from the drummer's laptop...all with vst pres. I'd also like to record drums every now and then. I have SATA II SSDs and 12 gigs of DDR3 ram. On paper, this is not too much to ask of that machine, but in practice, the Saffire Pro 40 (and later the M Audio Fast Track Ultra 8r) was the weak link in my signal chain. Also, two ports up front and six in back is just a dumb design. If this device had been capable of recording eight simultaneous ins as advertised, that would have been obnoxious.

The one I bought also had scratchy pots, which may not be your experience. You could say this is ""good for the price"" but I also bought an Andoer Trouble TC-16 on Amazon at the same time, for less money than the Pure Sky, and it blew the Pure Sky out of the water. Maybe I got a dud but, personally, I'd avoid this pedal.

3450,"NOTE: This review is not a review of the product itself, but the software and set-up process required to use the product.

Customer service is not available on the weekends. The software installation and setup process was a nightmare. The Focusrite website actually has very helpful videos walking you through the installation process, but unfortunately I ran into a variety of issues trying to install the software on two different computers (one PC and one Mac). Focusrite also has a variety of help-related videos on Youtube which also are very helpful, but I still ran into a variety of issues on both computers. After registering for every separate website from which I needed to download software, several downloads failed to load, on both computers, and my computers kept freezing through the process. Even if everything would have worked properly, the setup would have been extensive. I ended up returning the product mainly out of frustration over the amount of work it took to unsuccessfully set up the device. From what I have read and seen online, the device seems to be of very high quality but unfortunately, for me at least, I ran out of patience trying to make it work.",0

If you're on itunes, look up ""Crutch"" by Krosthredz. I used this pedal at the very end of the song during the guitar solo. That was my old 4-string American Standard jazz bass.

I tried an eminence redcoat CV-7516 and a Legend V1216; running a Jet City 22H 20W head into it, I prefer the V1216, which is less cost than the redcoat anyway. I also added some inner bracing using Birch wood to the corners to stiffen the box to reduce resonance, so it doesn't color the sound of the speaker as much. I also cut the back in half so I can have the bottom open if desired, this thing sounds great now, with the V1216 speaker the total cost is minimal for what I am getting out of it..",0

Seemed like a really good deal when I first saw all that was on offer for the money and the components, whilst mostly made of plastic, appeared on the surface to be reasonably well made. But unfortunately, the lapel mics have poor pickup unless placed right against the lips and at a very particular angle, the headsets don't fit well and will not facilitate any movement by the wearers without causing cut-outs, and the handhelds will also experience cut-outs at about 30ft. I used this set for 1 live concert gig and 1 conference event and have pretty much given up on them since. I really cannot recommend the headset or lapel components at all, and the handhelds only if being used at very close range to the base station with little movement envisaged.",0

3487,"I hate it. Why? I used it for just 2 gigs. Well one because it didn't work the second time. Good concept but bad. Bluetooth shows connected but when you pick a tone in the app on my iPad the tone does not change. Then logged out if the app and tried again. Forgot my log in so wouldn't let me do anything. Crippled me. I own this hardware why do I need to be logged into line 6 just to use it? And why didn't the tone change? It's not good. We started the gig 30 minutes late as a result. Used built in distortion from my fender amp. Tacky. This thing really is only suitable for a living room wannabe rockstar. Not for a pro. No shortcuts. Build your pedal board the way you like. This isn't a shortcut. And the tones aren't that great without a lot of tweaking at live volume level.

So the issue is- after you log in it syncs. Then says ""unable to load presets please try again"". Nope. Junk. Completely unusable. I really want to like this box. I want to love it.  But I hate it. Cannot rely on it to work at all at a gig. The tones are supposed to be in the iPad right? Nope. When it says unable to load presets you're done. You shouldn't need wifi either. As I sit here waiting for an hour's-long update I'm wasting a day off when I could be finishing my new song in the studio. I also had a line 6 head and 412 cab I picked up on the cheap. Hated it. Sounded like a cheap solid state amp. Nothing for a pro or even serious amateur over the age of 16. Utter crap. Go with what you know. Stay away from the gimmicks. Line 6 is lousy non-professional Chinese made garbage.

Unfortunately, a lot of high dollar $ digital pedals like Strymon and EvenTide, depend _heavily_ on their supplies being isolated.

The nice thing is most pedals don't require or even need isolated supplies, and the quiet power coming from this unit will be sufficient.

However, the reason for my one star review is THIS IS NOT an isolated supply as advertised. A simple voltmeter shows a common ground between all of the outputs. You cannot combine the outputs in series to produce 18v.",0
3491,"I've owned a lot of guitar stands over the years.  I've always liked On Stage mic stands, so this caught my attention.  Reviews seemed good, price was right, so I gave it a shot.  Wrong choice...

First of all, the stance on this stand is very narrow.  How I didn't notice that in the photos, I am not sure.  Holding a guitar, it does not seem stable, at all.  If I'm using a guitar stand, it has to be stable, period.

Second, I'm not sure who thought the design of this locking retainer was a good idea.  There is nothing natural about trying to get a guitar out of this stand.  It takes BOTH hands, and you cannot do it quickly.  Compared to my Hercules and Ultimate stands, this thing just does not measure up at all.  Save your time and money... get one of those...",0
3492,"It looks similar to all the other shock mounts with a range of 42mm to 48mm. I bought this for use with the MXL V67G which is 47mm diameter so I expect it to fit-though pretty snuggly. Another reviewer said it fit their V67G so even though the numbers are tight, I figured it fit theirs it should fit mine. I also liked the color instead of black.

However mine must be at the tight end of manufacturing tolerances as it will not expand enough to fit around my MXL V67G. I've taken the ""rubber bands"" off etc. to open the mounting hole to the max but it's still about 1mm smaller than the microphone. I'm not going to force the microphone as I don't want to scratch or damage either unit. I think the other reviewer may have been lucky theirs fit, but if you have a MXL V67G I'd recommend buying one that expands to 50mm minimum.

It is very nice looking with great color and seems to be constructed as well as any of the others. It just doesn't expand enough to fit around the MXL V67G mic that I have. I cannot give stars (points) for appearance, construction, etc. if I am not able to use it with my microphone, it's no use to me.",0

The metal used in this is extremely poor quality...

People have been complaining about this on the forums for a year at least, and the app is still broken.

You DO have 4 presets without the remote app, so you can still play WHEN bluetooth fails again, and you aren't in the mood to re-pair.

Note I've only tried this with my Nexus 7 Android (marshmallow) tablet.  If you read the forums, iPad users are complaining about connection drops in the middle of a session!  I do not experience this - once I'm connected, I'm good until I restart the amp.

I'm not returning the unit, because I'm just going to deal with the bluetooth issue.  The performace otherwise is great - this is a really cool unit. I hated the pocketPod.. this way easier to use.

After about 5 minutes, I gave up, and returned it.  I later had to settle for this 88-note version, which is obviously bigger than what I need, but at least it'll fit.

Pros:
- Not expensive compared to other cases I've seen (bought mine here for $43.32)
- Extremely light-weight
- Should protect against wind/rain.
- The customer service (my return transaction) from J&R Music and Computer World went pretty smoothly.

Cons:
- Misleading representation of product (i.e., it may NOT fit your keyboard because it is so tightly designed)
- It does not seem to protect against impact/drops.

Overall, I wish I didn't have to buy this bigger version for my keyboard, but at least I have what I need now.  This is definitely an improvement from carrying my keyboard fully exposed.

If you don't know this beforehand, you will almost definitely watch your expensive gear crash to the ground.  Lucky for me, my old Mackie Control Unit is built like a tank.

I give it a slight knock for being plastic (take good care of it if you do remote recording) and for the stand having a fairly large footprint and the tripod part not being very adjustable for the weight of the mic. I might replace it just to have a smaller footprint on my desk. But even so, for $50 it's going to work fine.",1

One of the speaker's wires wasn't soldered onto the speaker. So I just soldered it on and it worked great.

I would like to state. Yes this item sounds great, can't wait to give it to my wife for Christmas. I gave it 3 stars because I think it's pretty crappy that something from Yamaha would be assembled so poorly.

Def buy if in the market, but if a speaker doesn't work, take a look at the innards.

I'd played the guitar for years, but it was a 12 string with half the strings removed for fingerpicking, so the spacing wasn't perfect and when I got the new guitar, I started spending a lot more time practicing.
I had tried a guitar with heavy strings and it sounded great, but killed my finger tips, plus some of the ragtime blues I play requires bending so I started with custom light.
These strings last a long time, but the way I use them the coating gets kind of fuzzy and frays, but that doesn't affect the sound or the ability to keep using them.
These days with the heavier ""light"" uncoated D'Addario, I take a Planet Waves microfiber cloth, hook it under each string one at a time from bass to treble with my little finger, then press the fabric around the string and slide it up and down the length each time after playing. That makes uncoated strings keep great tone a LOT longer. At first you can feel the cloth dragging at certain spots then sliding smoothly.

When I swapped out these tubes I didn't find the difference I expected. While they do sound good, they didn't make the difference I was hoping for.

3564,"I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM GIVING THIS 1 STAR DEVICE 3 STARS.!

This tuner deserves 1 star because it is only a matter of time until its ratchet fails and the tuner will no longer stay on the instrument  The reason I can't award 1 star is because I continue to buy and use them. It is otherwise the ideal ukulele tuner where weight is paramount if the tuner will be left on the instrument most of the time.  If the ratchet didn't fail, this would be one of the easiest 5 star reviews I've written.

Also, I have a workaround for when one fails:
* I put the tuner on the instrument.
* I squeeze it to how it should be if the ratchet hadn't failed.
* I slide the tuner off the instrument without moving the ratchet.
* I use superglue to fix the ratchet so that it won't move.
* I let the tuner dry overnight, just to be safe.
* I slide the tuner back on the instrument.

So, flimsy = 1 star.  Without flimsiness, 5 stars.  There are things one can do should (when) the ratchet fail(s). I give up!  3 stars.

My original reviews follow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This could have been a great tuner.  It's one of those situations where first opinions can be misleading.  I got one, disliked it for the reasons stated below, and threw it in a drawer.  Lately, I decided that this tuner would be IDEAL for the ukulele, where weight is paramount.  I have a few ukes, so I bought two more!  What I' now finding out is that the ratchet system wears out, and no wonder. The ratchet is an inexpensive piece of plastic with tiny grooves. There's no spring. It appears that its the piece that fits into the groove that's worn out. No matter which part it is. It will no longer stay on.  It's a shame.  I was really starting to like this tuner and change my rating to 5 stars for use with a ukulele.  But, one star it is.
----------------------
Most other tuners have s spring loaded clamp that affixes the tuner to the instrument. This one doesn't.  It has a ratcheting device.  You squeeze it. and the tuner is ""held in place"" by pressure and slight friction from rubber pads on the inside surfaces. There's a plastic piece on the back that holds the ratchet closed.  Touch it (like when an instrument is in its case and the tuner touches a surface) and the tuner pops off.

Those looking for something small might consider a Son of Snark (aka mini-Snark).",1
3565,"I like the metronome. Easy to tap the tempo in, and from there, tap it up or down with the tiny but usable arrow keys. Easy to turn start and stop, too.

I like the tuner. It seems pretty accurate (for guitar). The plan is to use it for violin too, but haven't had the chance yet.

I paid the extra $20 for the recording function. I do not like the way it works.  The mic sensitivity is too low, and not adjustable. This means the recording level is frustratingly low. The playback is also extremely limited in volume level. So for practicing a singing part, I have to be a few inches away from the mic. I understand there may be a reason to have low sensitivity setting, especially with some band instruments, to prevent overloading/clipping. But why not provide a high-medium-low, or better yet, a 1-10 setting?  And why does the output need to be so weak.

Korg really dropped the ball on the added feature. Seems like they had a product, the TM50, and thought, ""How can we make a lot more $$ on this without requiring a significant investment? Let's add an old recording circuit we have lying around."" Seems that way, anyway.

For the convenience of the combined features in a small package, and despite the very poor recording function, I will probably keep this unit. But unless you really need the convenience, save your money for a separate, superior recorder, maybe an Olympus, and just get the TM50.",1
3566,"I bought this unit for building a portable 24 track recorder. ( I use a separate system for mixing and editing. ) The name 2626 suggests 26 track recordings are possible. But, DSP of this unit is capable of recording up to only 18 tracks. M-Audio site actually indicates this, but in an obscured manner. At the sampling rate of 88.2 or 96 kHz, the unit can record only up to 12 tracks instead of 18 tracks.

Combination with ADAT preamps, M-Powerd 8 and dual 2 GHz, XP, notebook PC works fine. 3 star rating instead of higher rating is due to confusing naming and obscured descriptions in their site.",1
3567,"Though it may impact the portable nature of the design, I wish it was a little bit taller as that would support that guitar a lot more.",1
3568,"No peg puller, which is odd and very counter to the all in one tool this claims to be.",1
3569,"You can use the long scale on medium-scale instruments shorter than a P-bass. You'll have adequate thinner lead to fit through open-slot tuner posts. Just work out the wrapping length before you start crimping so you don't overload the post (some people like that look but I prefer the minimum that'll hold securely). I'm not so sure about short scale basses like an EB - better measure first.

I reviewed the 5-string stainless steel set and preferred the strings' harder tension and smooth coating on a fretless. I put the 4-string set on a fretted Squire J-bass. I think the longer scale adds even more stiffness - quite a bit more than I like. I play with fingers and try to maintain a light touch by compensating with more volume than most people use when 'playing low'.

On the J-bass the Elixir set has a 'thuddy', punchy sound in the low end. It's not as warm as Fender flatwounds but it's a little more versatile. With some EQ tweaking they can sound appropriate for a variety of rock and jazz contexts. I prefer to roll off a lot of high end to make things as warm as possible.

I'm not much of a slap/puller and it's hard to imagine someone using such a tight set for that technique. The strings feel like they can really take a beating onstage but I don't play aggressively that way; I judge strings based on dynamic response, ease of shifting, and touch on both hands.

Bottom Line: I haven't really changed my mind on the combination of stainless steel strings on a fretted bass. I'll use them if I have to, but they're  not ideal and I still prefer nickel flatwounds and roundwounds. Strings are really subjective so the best advice I can give is to take anyone's advice for what its worth, take the time and expense to try alternatives, and draw your own conclusions.",1
3570,"These a cheaply made with corrugated plastic, however they are surprisingly durable. THESE ARE NOT 8.5x11 (paper size). They are about half-sheet size.",1
3571,Been using this item pretty heavy for the last couple years wish I would have got a heavier duty one! It works just make sure you periodically check the fasteners for tightness!,1
3572,"First, let me say that my expectations were pretty low based on feedback I have seen for apparently identical products (same box) sold under different names, usually for more money. And this thing does feel pretty cheap and flimsy, because it is. But that said, it is easily strong enough to hold up a guitar. It looks OK, and the finish and materials are fine. It's just that it is made out of plastic and its nicer competitors are generally higher quality materials and/or metal. But if it gets loose in your case, this thing is so light that it probably won't damage your guitar, which for me is a huge advantage that outweighs any ""perceived quality"" issues. The other ""perceived quality"" issue is the horrible sound it makes when using the ""suction release"" lever. It's a loud ""snap"", but is entirely within the mechanism, and does not affect the instrument in any way. It is caused by a small detent on a pin that gets preloaded, and the sound can be minimized by pushing on the center of the suction cup holder while using the release lever. A little plastic gear lube on the mechanism ramps and pins helped too.

I really have only two functional issues. First, it makes a very mild creaking sound when you stress it. I have not noticed it during performance, and I play classical guitar, which is generally pretty quiet. But I have noticed it when I'm positioning it. Second, it is not clear yet how long the suctions cup will remain secure, and since there is only one, when it releases, the guitar is unsupported. Now I have a shower grab bar with a similar mechanism remain attached for months, but thus far, this one has been inconsistent. One time it stays fixed for over an hour, and another time it does not last fifteen minutes. I may need to clean the ""Chinese factory debris""  from it a little better, and maybe just breathe on it before attaching it. I never plan to leave it on for more than a few hours, so the bar is not that high. Maybe the manufacturer has advice on a cleaner to use on the apparently silicone suction cup? How do  doe others clean the suction cups on similar devices? Anyone know of any tricks to make them stick better?

I've only used it twice, so the jury is still out. I initially bought it thinking that it would be a cheap guinea pig to see if I even like this type of support, but am encouraged such that I may not need to replace it with something better, and I like the light weight, lack of sharp corners, and the associated minimal risk of damage to the guitar. Plus, it fits in your case (like the Gitano), does not feel like a mechanistic contraption (and I design mechanisms for a living) like the Ergoplay, or potentially slide off your leg like the Dynarette.

So go ahead, roll the dice. It's only $10 or so. Like me you'll probably feel that you got more than you paid for. On the other hand., if you play long gigs for a living such that having a ""detachment"" would be a disaster (all my gigs are short and pretty casual), this may not be your best solution.",1
3573,"I would first like to say that the color of the picks that I got were a very light gray, almost an off-white. Second, these picks are incredibly thick (5 mm!), it's alright with my bass since the strings are far apart, but on a guitar it might be a bit too big and bulky (go with a 3mm version of the same pick instead). If you have a pick holder: good luck with fitting one of these AND another pick in with it (if it'll hold one at all). The size isn't too bad otherwise, it helps with grip a bit actually (on top of it being rubber, these things are never going to leave your hand!). There was a little bit of excess thin rubber on the tips of the picks from molding, but it's easy to take off with a nail clipper.

Play-wise, the rubber is very soft, so it does sound like you're playing with your fingers (but I don't know why I wouldn't rather use my fingers anyways, I suck at using picks).

Closing remarks: with its size, these are fitting to play the bass with and not guitar, but since it sounds like you're playing with your fingers anyways, it's kinda counter-intuitive as to why you would use this pick. If you play guitar, get a 3.0 mm version of this pick made by the same company.",1

3576,"I'm not a master guitar player or some kind of enthusiast. I play for fun, and I find these to be a bit overpriced. They are good strings, but I don't see much of a difference from the regular D'Addario strings. The packaging is definitely...luxurious. But once I put the strings on and started playing, I couldn't help but feel disappointed that I could of spent way less for strings that sounded and felt just as good when you put new ones on. Are they durable? I'm not too sure because I changed them out for a different set about a month after putting them on.",1
3577,"It definitely reduces the sound level and does not bum you out so much that you don't want to use it.

It most certainly drastically alters the feel of any snare drum....as one might expect, the rebound is killed, however, still useable. The extra resistance and effort required might help strengthen rudiment strokes...I take it off for a song or two every hour just to be happy again feeling how a real snare should.

3586,"The Pathfinder 10 is a great practice amp...practice amp. in fact this amps sweet spot (matter of opinion) is found at a very low volume. I play primarily through an American Deluxe Strat-HSS. My LP is too hot and sounds kind of like hot trash through it.

First, what I would not do with this amp - ""gig"" with it. Play it out, play it live or with a drummer. It is a $70 - 10w solid state amp. You have to crank it to do those things and solid state amps just don't sound as good maxed as they do at mid levels. This amp sounds terrible with everything dimed. That doesn't mean you can't...and if your budget is only $70 for your amp, then do what you gotta do.

What is has. Gain control & channel, volume, bass and treble. Using the gain channel as a distortion doesn't sound great to me. In fact it sounds like a can of bees. Not the good Cobain kind of bees; the, ""I think your amp is smokng, dude,"" kind of bees.

However, using the gain control (not channel) and volume together creates a very full clean sound. Some of my pedals like clean boosts or clean drives don't really do much with the Pathfinder, but they are designed for tube amps and that is understandable (refer to above ""bee"" sounds for a better description). Also, analog delay doesn't sound great, but digital delays and light reverb are cool (of course).

I use it for true bedroom practice. and just wanted something that I could run my pedal board into that had a little character. We also have had a Roland Microcube in the house, but it is very sterile sounding. The Vox actually carries that Vox tone and has a bit of warmth. I've also spent a lot of time on the AC4TV tube amp and that is much better, but also a lot louder and $300.

I do knock of stars for the non existant gain and amps intolerance for effects. For the price, less than a cheap effect pedal or video game with some DLC, this is an awesome value and really good clean practice amp. Again, if you need to practice your Meshuggah riffs, you need to look elsewhere. A tiny bit of reverb and delay sounds really good and for open chording or practicing with your headphones on, this is a great investment.",1

The leather is so thick that I can't even get rubber washers over it to circumvent this issue.  It seems to fit slightly better over a different guitar because the buttons are longer... it still doesn't fit right, but I will be able to put rubber washers to prevent slipping.  I wouldn't dare use this strap on my super spendy Taylor.  It's too bad.  I really like the strap.... and I can still use it so it's not a total loss.  They just need to model their leather ends after the many other companies that have seemed to figure this out.",1

3600,"This is my first time trying Elixir strings. Im a huge Martin Life Span strings. These strings did compare to their martin counter parts. But had several advantages and disadvantages that I noticed. A major advantage that I loved about these strings was the smoothness. The strings are slick, and when sliding up and down the frets is almost perfectly silent. Another advantage was the packing, individual packaging per string was nice.

Something I dislike about these strings is that they sound great when played individually and picking. But when strumming the quality of their sound greatly diminishes.

So My final conclusion and the reason for my score is very personal. I love chords and strumming more so than picking, and i find that Martin strings have better tone with strumming than these strings. If I was a huge picker I would stay with these strings. All in all still a good set of strings.

Note: I only have 10 hours of play time on these strings. If they warm up to the guitar I will change my review.",1

Only problem with this capo is the cheapy piece of plastic tape they use to protect the neck from the metal edge.  And that's all it is:  plastic tape.  Very tacky.  Your best bet when you get the thing is to peel that tape off and replace it with a strip of electrician's tape.  At least you get a little padding from the rubber. Probably would have cost them all of a nickel to mold a piece of plastic on there or just continue the plastic from the portion that goes against the strings...but no.",1

Holy cow I was this close to cleaning up those areas when thankfully someone called me and I read the entire bottle to the very end.

The feature set of the amp is nice, and the rhythm tracks are a fantastic feature not found on any other micro practice amp I've seen. It even has a (low E) tuner.

It takes 6 AA batteries (cheapies included), but it can be powered by a 9V ac adaptor from any of your pedals that you might have lying around.

This item didn't work well for me. What I found was that even with the drive switch set low, my bass (a Jazz Bass loaded with two humbuckers) caused the sound to be significantly distorted even at the clean settings. I think it was just too much output for this little amp and its speakers.

If you have a passive bass and want a practice tool that gives you rhythm patterns and battery/AC power flexibility, this might work.",1
3610,"I did a ton of research before buying the MM6.  There are some great videos on YouTube from a sales rep / company spokesman who was very entertaining.  The keyboard does have great sounds, but it has a much lighter/cheaper feel than I thought it would.  It feels more like a Yamaha PSR or Casio than a real workstation or synth.  I also think the rhythm patterns are a bit misleading.  Like many various devices being marketed today (from guitar multi effects to multi track recorders), it comes with what seems to be advertised as a drum machine.  But you really can't edit or program the patterns-- they are just pre-set patterns.  I suppose they are more fun than a metronome, but only marginally more useful.

3617,"This package is a good place to start if you're just getting into recording higher quality audio on your mobile device.  My only real gripe with it is the price... it seems considerably more expensive than the sum of it's parts.  The mic is okay, but if I bought it separately I wouldn't expect to pay more than $50-60 for it.  For $100 you can buy a high quality mic like a Shure SM58, and then pick up an XLR-to-3.5mm cable for $20, and get a much higher level of quality - but you'd have to put the set together yourself... this package comes already together and that may be a convenience that's important to you.

The thing that makes this set appealing is the the cable: unlike most XLR-to-3.5mm cables for mobile devices, this one has a mini-plug headphone jack in it.  It's really important that you can hear the audio input as you're recording it so you can hear if there are any unwanted noises like wind, and to check that the volume is adequate.  The audio jack on this cable is a real bonus and if you bought it separately it would be about $25.",1
3618,"I play with my nails on electric, acoustic, etc. These here, I imagine, were by someone imagined, to simulate a nail (the black pick) on a bruised thumb (the yellow part). Looking at them that's what comes to mind. Putting one on I realized I should have gotten a thicker black pick, because a real thumbnail is thicker. The more I tried to rotate and adjust it, the more frustrated I became. I couldn't find any useful position. It's adjustable - like a chicken on an escalator: yes, but so what. There's no accounting for taste and anatomy. Thumb picks are strange, only the Alaskas actually resemble a natural nail, and yet a lot of people play OK with odd plastic protrusions.

All I can say is the BumbleBee doesn't work for me, but if Mr Kelley made them that way, it must have worked for him. It's like any tale of creation, there are believers, and there malcontents who don't get it, wanna know  things like:  If He made it all in 7 days, what was He standing on, and what was there before, huh? And why would anyone create something that's imperfect, serpent and all? At 3 for fifteen bucks we might expect more guidance, like a little Chenglish instruction sheet with diagrams.

I don't think there's any way to predict how a BumbleBee will fit you, or if you can even play with one. I can't. The thin/large is very thin and flappy. To be fair I'll allow that a thicker smaller pick might work better. Or worse. It might be smart for Mr Kelley to package 3 different gauges in a trial pack, but you might get lucky, some people love them, worth a try ?",1
3619,"First off, the drum sounds on this things are great. They are of the quality where they will sometimes sound a bit funny when recording demos if you don't spend enough time getting your guitars and such to sound as good as the drums. The touch sensitive pads respond naturally and aren't just simply the same sounds turned down or up. The machine mimics the natural response of drums being hit harder or softer.  I also noticed that when you do things like hit an open high-hat sound, it stops ringing if you hit the closed hat immediately after. Things like this are the kind of details that enable you to really mimic having an actually drummer. If you are simply looking for a hardware drum machine w/ punchy sounds and lots of control, I don't think you can do better than this.

The other features are where it comes up a bit short...

The included bass sounds are only decent. One nice feature is you can rout the bass (or anything) to a separate output so you can run the bass sounds to an actual bass amp and the drums to the PA and get a more realistic live sound that way. That being said, if there is one way a recording made w/ this thing is going to be pegged by the listener as being made by a machine, it's the bass-lines.

I also feel like this is a bit lacking in terms of some electronic drum sounds. There are a few kits but they kind of feel like an afterthought to me. If you are looking for natural sounds, they are here, but if you want great samples of 808 kicks or whatever, you will probably do better looking towards something more oriented towards dance music as this seems pretty solidly aimed at the rock musician w/ a home studio. Similarly, I really wish their were some synth sounds build in and more tracks in the sequencer for other parts. You can simulate having multiple instruments w/ the bass lines as it has great polyphony and you can shift the octaves and play chords but it's not the same as being able to add some strings or an emulated analog synth on a separate track. One of the DR-880's predecessors, the DR-5, had this feature and it is one of the things that made that such a great box despite having limited sound quality compared to newer models. I am not sure why Boss did away w/ it. It seems like this is an uncomfortable balance between being an all-in-one groovebox type deal and a simple drum machine. If I am going to have to use external synths to fill out my sound, I might as well use them for bass lines too.

That being said, one thing this excels at is being a jam-along box for guitar practice, which is pretty much what I have ended up using it for. The amp simulators in there are passable at best for recording or live performance but they are plenty good enough to jam along to the drum beats on and the included effects are fun to mess around w/. This is also where the semi-cheesy bass sounds become very useful. You can do any manner of odd time signature or tempo change you want and there is plenty of flexibility in song and pattern structure. I am not terribly keen on the step programming process for the songs but it gets the job done and you only have to do that once.

Overall, as a drum machine, it's great. There's a bit of a steep learning curve for me even though I've been using other drum machines for years but, you gotta figure each box you pick up is a whole new instrument. As a guitarist, you can't expect to really wail on mandolin the first time you pick it up and you should not have the same expectation for a new drum machine. I do feel though, that for the price, it is not unfair to expect a more full featured jambox w/ better sequencing capabilities and sounds to use as a stand alone unit.",1

3629,"Looks like all the istomp downloadable pedals are free now except The Impossible pedal which is still downloadable for $19.99. The istomp is now worth it if all 46 pedals remain free and if the istomp is around $20-$40 rangeThe istomp can only be 1 pedal at a time, if you find the istomp under $40, it is totally worth it because it can transform into 46 pedals for free at the time of this writing, October 2013. It was $225 when it first came out a few years back, and the downloads used to cost .99 to $19.99 but now they about all free except 1.

But if you find it for more than $50 it would be wiser to buy a digitech rp155 multi effects pedal. There really isn't a point in buying the istomp and changing the effects, it takes 30-50 seconds each time.and you can only use 1 effect at a time. wiser to go with a multi effects pedal unless you find this pedal very cheap.. With a multi effects pedal you can use more than 1 effect at once and it doesn't take 30 seconds to change effects each time. I found mine (istomp)for $25 used at guitar center which was justifiable. There's always a lot of multi effects pedals at guitar center on sale, sometimes around $50. The concept behind the istomp is doomed for failure unless they have some extremely unique downloadable pedals for free on the iTunes App Store. Also note that the istomp I have comes with an adaptor that works with my iphone 4, I don't know if iphone 5 users will have a problem? This pedal may be disposable in a few years if your iphone goes out, I don't know how it's gonna go once you change phones and your iphone becomes broken. A new wire to connect to a different phone costs $40. It's made in the USA. It's a good solid plastic body.

The main problem is that the app is really glitchy depending on which phone or update you have for it. It works some of the time and is really annoying. You may or may not have this problem. The sound quality is great. But the overall concept of the istomp makes no sense. Just get a multi effects pedal, it's no hassle with the iPhone apps and more effects to use at once. I hope the come up with more pedals for free. once your iphone becomes irrelevant, this pedal may also be irrelevant.

Don't get me wrong, it's still fun to play with. I think amazon has this pedal for $40 brand new now which isn't bad. If you get this pedal you can email them and request for labels for the pedal, they also sent me 4 free guitar picks which was nice. There's a couple pedals on the app that sounds really good such as the dod overdrive, the lexicon reverb and the acoustic one sounds really good.

Some free pedals id like to see on this would be a reverse delay, a reverse wah, more chorus pedals, and more unique experimental pedals that may draw more buyers in.",1

3635,"I spent the time to read all of the reviews here before buying, so I had an idea what to expect. For $29.99, I figured it would be an experiment I could afford.

The review by Abramelin is right on the mark. The ART Tube MP Studio provides good amplification. I use it mostly to run a bass direct into a mixer. It serves that role very well, but it has spent the last 2 days being tested non-stop in guitar signal chains, bass signal chains, DI applications and other roles. It is surprisingly well built for this price point. However, as others have mentioned, it does not provide that degree of tube warmth that one looks for when utilizing a tube preamp. I wasn't expecting Avalon, but I was expecting something more noticeable.

The VU meter works and is helpful in getting you to the right settings. The boost does exactly what it is supposed to, but it also boost the hiss and hum that others have mentioned. Nice features for a $29.99 product.

The hiss and hum reviewers repeatedly mention is IMHO largely the product of the tube. Some of these come with a Shuguang 12AX7. I have seen some with EH12AX7s. Others report Sovtek 12AX7s. Mine came stock with Shuguang 12AX7 that was not bad, but it did increasingly hiss as I turned up the output. I have lots of experience with current production preamp tubes and a small warehouse of good quality NOS tubes. I tried quite a few. The solution to the hissing was to stick a 1980s GE 5751. Any good quality NOS 5751 will do. Do not use a current production 12AX7 or 5751! The hiss is now minimized and I get all the amplification I need to run direct into the mixer. In this latter application, the ART Tube MP Studio neither improves nor degrades the tone, but amplifies it more than sufficiently to get the job done.",1
3636,Nicely-sized for the GS Mini - but a variety of colors would be appreciated.,1
3637,"I don't find the stock delays in this particularly good sounding, though there are some toneprints that are better.  If you want better sounding delays, the TC Electronic Nova Delay outshines this.  I have both to compare side-by-side everything in the Nova Delay sounds so much cleaner.  The ducking delay hardly appears to work compared to the same feature on the Nova Delay and the reverse delay on the Nova is far more useful thanks to a better mixing ability (can go 100% wet from a knob control on the front of the unit) .. not only that, there is something just inherently better about the reverse effect in the Nova.  No ability to tweak the modulation settings on the Flashback makes the modulation feature less useful.  The analog setting when compared to an MXR Carbon Copy is not nearly as pleasing (or even the Nova).

What I do like about this is its simplicity and the addition of a looper (though, it is a very simple looper.  Not worth buying the pedal just for that).  On a loud stage, the audio quality probably wouldn't be a problem, but auditioning this in the studio revealed more about it.  I'll be sticking with the Nova and the Carbon Copy for now.",1
3638,Nice way to keep your picks together. I don't think I'll ever actually stick it to any guitar. I do have a zip-pocket on my guitar gig case which is a fine place to keep it.,1
3639,The filter attachable part is pretty cheap and broke down while i was setting it up. The base itself its great but unfortunately it's not as sturdy as describe,1
3640,Not what I expected,1
3641,"First worth noting is that the foam used in the upper is firm so despite being about an inch shorter than my folding bench (with a softer foam on the seat) this feels about the same height in use. As I'm using it on a digital piano (casio privia PX 860 brown) the height seems reasonable but I'd prefer it be an inch or two taller.

The overall size and shape is reasonable and so far it feels sturdy enough. The legs have fixed bolts inside them which attach to brackets in the frame under the seat using supplied nuts/washers. You will require a wrench to the install these suitably tightly (finger tight will definitely not suffice). I applied them tightly and noticed the shaft rotated somewhat as I got them to their tightest; this is presumably a negative as it's not clear how the bolts are actually attached within the legs so this may have caused unseen damage (having said that I can't detect any weakness thus far).

The main reason for not rating this more highly is the colour. I have the ""rosewood"" version but as a piece of furniture the colour and finish is quite inconsistent. The seat itself is basically black. The frame supporting the seat and attaching the legs is deep brown with a wood grain texture, very much like my piano's cabinet. The legs,  however, are an untextured reddish-brown colour. The look is not bad but not as consistent or well matched to my piano as I had hoped.

Overall a serviceable piano bench that I suspect will last reasonably but not entirely the look I was hoping for: acceptable given the price.",1
3642,"This pedal is not entirely ""transparent"". But it probably is more ""transparent"" than most overdrives out there. I found that it cuts the bass and gives a mid EQ bump. It sounds good, but if you are looking for a transparent overdrive, something to retain your EQ and just add a little grit, this is most likely not what you are seeking.",1

3660,"This unit has a great selection of effects, including a parametric EQ that helps shape your tone.  The amp modeling selection is also great.  Unfortunately it has significant drawbacks.  The distortion stomps will lower your output when engaged, making it difficult to use in stomp mode without affecting your playing volume.  The sound dropoff when changing patches is also too noticeable.  I found the Zoom G3 to be more versatile and have seamless patch changes (rated at 1 millisecond), so this may be a better choice.  Personally I think this unit can only be used for home practice until Digitech improves the patch change speed.",1

You can buy a better guitar for the price of this guitar and amp.",1
3668,"I really want to like this pedal but it has some issues. First the pros: I like the fact that it is built like a tank. It doesn't move around when using it. The minimum volume control is a great feature. I haven't had any problems with the pedal getting loose as other have. It stays where I leave it. I also haven't had any issues with the volume pedal effecting my tone.
Now the cons: The problem for me is that I need it for slow swells and fade outs. When I first got it the volume change all happened in a very small portion of the pedal's rocking action. It was basically an on/off. I've spent time adjusting the internal LEDs and that has helped but it still isn't gradual enough. The minimum volume has been key to getting a better rate of swell and without it this pedal wouldn't work for me at all. Shouldn't a pedal in this price range be tested and adjusted at the factory so that the purchaser can just plug it in and use it? Also, it hogs a lot of space on the pedal board. You can fit 3 regular sized effects pedals on this thing. If you want one of these, consider the mini version.
I would recommend going to a retailer and trying one of these first. If you like it, buy the one you tried. From reading all of the reviews, it sounds like they aren't consistent from the factory.",1
3669,"I was very disappointed after my product demo of this mixer. It works pretty good as a plain analog console but completely fails as an interface.

This console is best fitted for dj's that only play pre mixed music and would do pretty well for karaoke if you use a laptop because you can use the USB for your tracks.

It is plastic. This isn't bad per se, but I wouldn't want it on the floor next to foot pedals, it's very light and small, but for use other than a handheld portable, it's not worth it.

3677,"I use my Danelectro DSR-1 with non-reverb tube amps (a Silverface Princeton and a 10-watt single-ended Frenzel).  It can produce decent analogue (MOSTLY analogue, see below) reverb, even enough for some surf sounds, but the short spring lengths restrict dwell time compared to Accutronics tanks.  I looked inside, and noted that the footswitch is not a typical design, but rather a momentary unit that latches some sort of circuitry.  Probably sturdy enough as switches go, but who knows?  I've had the unit for some months, but only have about 20 hours use on it.  The knobs all function, with ""Volume"" being a wet-dry blender. The DSR-1 is not true bypass, and must be powered to operate.  The 9-volt battery door is easily accessible and clips back in place firmly.  The DSR-1 takes a standard center-negative wall wart adapter, but the two I tried induced too much hum, so I run it with an old Boss RPW-7 multi-tap power supply which is quieter.  On battery power it is hum-free.  The large 6 1/2 x 9 1/4 metal case is heavy-duty, and the jacks are good quality, as is the on-off light.

Danelectro apparently felt they had to 'thicken' the sound due to the short dwell, and added a bit of short-delay digital echo.  It's acceptable, but I would have preferred an internal off switch for it.

If you're doing a lot of surf music, this probably won't be 'wet' enough, but for short money (compared to an outboard tube reverb unit) it gets the analogue sound.",1

3699,"first of all im a staunch believer that a violin should not have plastic on it, lest we let the chinese know its ok to start making plastic violins.
jsi is a good company and shipped quickly.
but this chin rest is suitable for those who need plastic. it really don't matter about weight, it is slightly less than a wood one and shouldnt compute in overall by much..
this shipped fast, and jsi does have all right customer service for the most part when i called about chinrests fitting/not fitting from my previous order, they said i just have to keep trying them out...eh gads that could take a long time.

the reason why I give this 3 starts  is that the plastic makes my chin slip around its really icky feeling, your skin does not  grip it like wood. I didn't see mention of this in any reviews the benefits of wood. I'm not allergic to metal so i just need a center chinrest that cleared the tail piece which this certainly does, i have had other  jsi rosewood flat flesch styles that simply did not clear the tail piece.and frustratingly it was made bad which I then took out my frustrations with a dremmel tool to try to cure the problem, which to no avail it just turned out to be a lousy design, so im back in the market for a proper fitting flat flesch. i went with the one kennedy violins had as they took many photos and sppent much time e mailing back and forth helping me measure out my violin to make sure their chin rest  fit. i originally bought my violin there anyway and their superb service just wants me to send them chocolates!
anyway everything else about this is well made, tightens properly, and is well made, its just...well plastic, which i knew going in but didn't realize my skin does not  hug the chinrest. id try moleskin to prevent that, but why bother, ill get an ebony one.",1

3701,"This stuff will clean your cymbals, fairly well too. There are a few problems though.

The first, as has been mentioned, is the odor. It's not that it is terrible, it just isn't plesant and it is very strong. I would highly recommend using it outside if possible. Mostly because it is hard to breath when using it indoors. The odor doesn't linger though so if you must use it inside a particulate filiter may help.

The second is it didn't get my cymbals as nice looking as I expected it to. It definitely made them better but nothing like new. Again, they are much cleaner than before but because they are still not new looking I actually think I'd have been better off leaving them.

The third, and part of the reason it may be better to just leave them, is it started to remove the printing on the cymbals. It didn't completely remove the printing but it made it very light. Another cleaning with this stuff and it would likely be gone.

I'd say this stuff would be more useful in a couple of situations. First is if you used it occasionally on new cymbals to keep them looking new. Mine were older and quite dingy and stained. As I said they did get brighter but no where near new. If you used it on newer cymbals every so often it would likely keep them looking like new. The second thing is that you would have to be willing to lose any lettering printed on the cymbals. I know some people have no issue at all with this as most cymbals are stamped anyway. Other will have a problem with it and so they should avoid using this.",1

For the part that actually works it puts out a wonderful sound.

3713,"I bought a used Warlock from a seller on this page for an excellent price, and though it took a while to arrive the seller delivered as promised. The volume control had been replaced by a Gibson style control and stuck out way to far (seller had noted this), but the guitar itself was in excellent condition cosmetically, with no chips, scratches or cracks and only minor wear. Since the shape of the Warlock lends itself to being easily damaged, I was amazed and delighted at how good the condition of the body and neck were in! The only other problem was the 3-position switch was going bad (a fairly common problem I've seen in BC Rich imports).

The Warlock itself was a Bronze Series (Model WG-5T/BK) and was marked Made in Indonesia. The serial number indicates it was manufactured in 2009. There are a few differences from the versions coming from China and/or Korea, the most noted being the use of vintage covered tuners rather than die cast tuners. Most other changes are minor and cosmetic. The headstock was the 6-in-line as in the product picture (and not the Widow headstock in the other pictures), and it came with chrome hardware, 2 humbucker pickups and a wrap-around bridge (which is adjustable for intonation, thank God!).

Last October I had purchased (online) an used NJ Series Warlock from Guitar Center (a 1997 model per serial number), but due to a problem with the locking nut I had to return it (they had not disclosed the problem and then the local GC didn't want to fix it). And I've been wanting to replace it ever since as it was one of the most comfortable guitars to use that I've come across. With things being so tight these days, I had to wait till I found a good deal on another Warlock.

As luck would have it, a great deal came up here in Amazon and I made the purchase with the idea of dealing with the inherent weaknesses of the Bronze Series Warlock (namely neck coupling, hum & buzz, high action due to the wrap-around bridge, and pickups that many consider lackluster and muddy though suited to playing heavy distortion metal). I had started learning guitar repair and setup a year or so ago and I'm actually much better at fixing them than playing them at this point in time! Biggest bummer is that now I could fix that NJ Series Warlock from GC myself now, though I didn't know how to then. I kind of wish I had held onto it rather than returned it!

Here are the changes I made to this Warlock:

1. Replaced original humbuckers with passive BC Rich BSDM covered humbuckers (OEMs bought on eBay, a-la older Kerry King Metal Master & ""V"" guitars, etc). - Update: Amazon now has these online at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B-C-Rich-Black-Metal-Covered-B-S-D-M-Humbucker-Set-Pickups-to-Kerry-King-Warlock-V-LesPaul/dp/B00AY8Q4JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B.C. Rich Black Metal Covered B.S.D.M Humbucker Set Pickups to Kerry King Warlock V LesPaul</a>
2. Replaced the closed body 3 position switch that was bad with a Gibson style open body 3 position switch (easier to clean if needed)
3. Removed tone control pot and cap and replaced them with an Artec EXP boosted tone control circuit and 9v battery (also bought on eBay, converts guitar to a low impedance output similar to active pick-ups as well) Note - see 12-Sept-2013 Update below
4. Replaced the output jack with a TRS jack to power up the Artec EXP only when plugged into an amp (so battery isn't wasted) Note - see 12-Sept-2013 Update below
5. Replaced volume control 500k linear pot with 500k audio taper pot (reused the original tone control pot without the cap)
6. Lined all the control and pickup cavities with grounded EMF shielding (to save cost I used a combination of both aluminum and copper tape) Note -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MG-Chemicals-838-Total-Ground-Carbon-Conductive-Coating-340-g-12-Oz-Aerosol-Can-Dark-Grey/dp/B008OA931A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MG Chemicals 838 Total Ground Carbon Conductive Coating, 340 g (12 Oz) Aerosol Can, Dark Grey</a>&nbsp;is a good and cheap alternative to metal tape for EMF shielding as well.
7. Increased neck angle by adding .5mm to neck shim height (for a total of 1.5mm) by replacing shims with larger ones made from a credit card, allowing me to lower the bridge, and thereby the action, significantly
8. Slightly enlarged the holes in the body for the screws holding the neck so the neck can be firmly tightened against the body (making it so screws only grip the neck and freely pass thru the body allows tighter coupling of the neck to the body)
9. Tightened down all 4 neck screws to the same torque (using a B&D cordless screwdriver with clutch set to 3)
10. Replaced strings with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Addario-EXL110-Nickel-Wound-Electric-Guitar-Strings-Regular-Light-10-46/dp/B0002F7K7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Regular Light, 10-46</a>
11. After restringing, I loosened then re-tightened the neck screws so the neck would be pulled tight against the body by the string tension
12. Replaced strap buttons with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOXX-59016-16mm-Strap-Lock-Screw-Set-Nickel-Finish-2-Pair-Screw-Set-with-Multi-Tool/dp/B0089X1I7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LOXX 59016 16mm Strap Lock Screw Set - Nickel Finish (2-Pair Screw Set with Multi-Tool)</a>&nbsp;to use with my LOXX equipped padded strap (really liking that LOXX strap lock system!)

It's like an entirely different guitar now!! It has a robust sound, suited to more than just metal, without all the hum and crackling that used to be there. It has incredible sustain too after the changes to how the neck is coupled with the body. With the changes to the neck angle, the action was dropped down to almost half the height it was before and only a minor adjustment to the bridge was required to eliminate some fret buzz around the 22nd fret.

It sounds and plays like a much more expensive guitar now. The guitar had great intonation before I did anything to it and it retained that near perfect intonation (after minor adjustments) even after changing both the neck angle & the gauge of the strings (9s -> 10s) and then lowering the bridge (which is less than a 1/2 turn up from dead bottom now).

If you were to do only one thing to your Warlock Bronze Series guitar to make it play better, it would be to do #8 above so you get better coupling of your neck to the guitar body, though #9 & #11 would be pretty simple to do as well at that point. It'll cost you nothing but about 15 minutes of your time and can make a world of difference in how the Warlock performs. It also doesn't cost anything if you want to change the neck angle and lower the bridge (#7 above), but you need an understanding what you are doing to get it adjusted properly. But doing this change is worth the effort as well.

With the cost of the Warlock (including shipping) and the cost of the parts I used for the upgrades (BC Rich covered PUs, Artec EXP tone control, copper & aluminum EMF tape, strings, LOXX screws and 3-postion switch), I have about $120 into this guitar. And while it was a fine guitar before I started (only really needing the 3-postion switch replaced), it's significantly better now with these upgrades.

I may at some point in the future replace the stock vintage covered tuners with a set of chrome Grover 305 tuners (another $25), but I'm not having any problem with the guitar staying in-tune with the current tuners. Replacing the tuners with Grover 305s is not a minor task either, the vintage tuners use a hole size of 8.7mm and they would have to be bored out to 10mm to fit the Grover tuners (or similar die cast tuners). I've done some testing and found that I can use a metric propeller reamer to enlarge the holes as the prop reamer is self-centering and made for hard wood. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Planes-Precision-Prop-Reamer-Metric-Shafts-GPMQ5007/dp/B001KNGAXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Planes Precision Prop Reamer Metric Shafts GPMQ5007</a>&nbsp;makes a perfectly sized 10mm hole that fits the 10mm tuners quite well in my testing using a broken hard wood prop reamed out to 10mm. But it's not an irreversible mod like all the other mods I've made are, so I could never restore the guitar to it's original state. We'll have to see, if the vintage tuners start giving me problems, then I'll have no choice but to replace them.

The other mod I've thought of doing (also irreversible) is to replace the nut. Though the one that came on the guitar is plastic, it may even be a self-lubricating plastic, and is slotted perfectly for this guitar. Unless it wears out fast, I can't see replacing it right now, but maybe later down the road.

My next project is a BC Rich Platinum Pro Beast I got off eBay that came with a Coffin Case (the case alone was worth what I paid for the whole thing). It needs pretty much the same stuff done to it as I did to the Warlock, except for the neck adjustments. It also has several dings, scratches and chips that I'll need to learn to repair. I expect I'll likely sell that one off after I restore and upgrade it, I'm really liking my Warlock now and it'll suit my needs for a while to come!

I'm rating the Warlock Bronze Series only 3 stars because you can get better guitars for the brand new price, though they can really be worth the price if you can get one used (most pawn shops sell these for around a $100 or so and always seem to have them available). Issues with the way the neck is put together, the high action that's a consequence of how it's designed, and the one-trick-pony stock humbuckers (metal only) make this guitar less desirable than it might be otherwise.

If you MUST have a Warlock, then you'd be better off spending the little bit of extra money on a higher model Warlock, like one with the string thru body design. Or doing as I did, buying a used one cheap and upgrading it yourself.

If you are flexible in the style of guitar, for less money (at the time of this review) you can get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dean-Vendetta-Select-Classic-Black/dp/B0030MMHBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dean Vendetta Select - Classic Black</a>&nbsp;with a mahogany body rather than the agathis plywood body of the Warlock Bronze Series. This Dean Vendetta Select is one of the best deals going for an entry level guitar as this looks to be similar to the older model of the Dean Vendetta 1.0 before they moved from mahogany to basswood for the body. Owning one of the older mahogany body Dean Vendetta 1 guitars I can tell you, it seriously outdoes the Warlock Bronze Series in almost everything, though I personally like the feel of the Warlock's neck and frets, and I like the body style of the Warlock too. But prior to finishing the work I was doing on this Warlock, it was the Dean Vendetta 1 that I was using...

12-Sept-2013 Update: I pulled the Artec EXP booster circuit out that I discuss in 3 & 4 above and replaced it with an audio taper 500K pot and a .033uf cap in a regular tone control configuration, and put the old TS jack back in as well. While I absolutely loved the tone I was getting from Artec EXP, the replacement pickups are so hot (neck 12K/bridge 15K, compared to only 8K on the originals PUs) that the +20db boost from the EXP was just too much. This also brought the cost I have into this guitar down to only around $100 or so and it sounds great with this new tone control setup. The cap value of .033uf was a good choice for these PUs (I used a tiny 50v ceramic cap for this).

I plan to put the Artec EXP into a Xaviere XV-600 (a Telecaster style hollow-body guitar) that I just picked up as blemished for $109. It's the vintage cream color with maple fretboard and comes with GFS Dream 180 pickups, perfect for the EXP booster circuit! I also picked up a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bugera-BC15-15-Watt-Vintage-Guitar-Amp-with-12AX7-Valve/dp/B003LQ2Z8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bugera  BC15 15-Watt Vintage Guitar Amp with 12AX7 Valve</a>&nbsp;to use with both guitars for that creamy tube sound as well.

While I bought of set of locking tuners for the Warlock, the stock vintage tuners are working surprisingly well, so I plan to leave them as-is and use the locking tuners on the XV-600. That'll be real nice!

I also added the locking tuners to the XV-600 as well as replacing the stock stamped metal string trees with roller string trees and it stays in tune well and just sounds great with those GFS Dream 180 pickups!

I added&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BC-Rich-Skreeming-Skullz-Set-of-2/dp/B0045UXCLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BC Rich Skreeming Skullz (Set of 2)</a>&nbsp;to the Warlock which really refined it's look! Haven't needed to do anything to the Warlock's nut or to the tuners.

I did place the merest drop of blue lock tight(semi-permanent) where the control pot's nut meets the threads on both the volume and tone control pots, as well as on the jack's nut, to ensure these don't work loose. You put a VERY small drop on after you tighten the nut and give it a minute or so to wick into the thread. Then you wipe off the excess. This creates an easily broken lock that prevents the vibrations that occur during playing from loosening the nuts on the control pots and the jack. Do NOT use red lock tight for this, as there's no guarantee you can unscrew the nut later!! I have taken apart controls and jack after using blue lock tight, so I know this works.

Still haven't touched the BC Rich Beast guitar I mention in my original review above! Maybe sometime this year... I also found a great source of used equipment, 'Music Go Round', great deals on used equipment though shipping is a bit high (but you can still end up with a great deal, even with this additional cost).

Compared to my Behringer ultra metal, it sounded similar to me, not exactly the same, but similar enough you could substitute one for the other. This pedal has a lot of gain, but it sound muffed/muddy to me, also like the Ultra Metal. Since I already have the Ultra Metal and prefer it more than this, this is going back, but for the low price it is now, assuming you get one that functions correctly, its a decent pedal.

PROS:
* Metal construction, which surprised me at this price.
* Good feel, easy to hold
* Right size, right shape
* Looks like the popular Shure Green Bullet

CONS:
* Just not the right sound.  It's not ""bad"" sound... just not the tone one would hope for from a harp mike. It's too ""clean"", offering none of the grit or intensity of the Green Bullet or other specialty mikes.
* Tends to feedback easily (the instructions actually give information on how to avoid feedback).  This is common in bullet mikes, but seems a bit more prominent in this one.
* The cord is hard-wired into the mike rather than plugged. This isn't unique; the GB has the same setup.  I'm sure this is to reduce cost, but for about $25 more one can get a  plug-corded mike, allowing for easy replacement if the cord is damaged. (One of the main complaints of Green Bullet users is the hassle involved in replacing a damaged cord.)
* The volume control is unresponsive, with zero or very little sound on the low end and sudden, almost-full gain as one approaches the high end.  It makes me wonder if they used a type-B linear pot instead of a type-A audio.  As another user mentioned issues with the volume control, it could just be a matter of quality control.

These are just my opinions. Different people have different tastes and requirements.  I do agree with the other reviews that ""for the price"" this is an okay mike.  But this is one case in which I'd hoped to get a good buy and instead got what I paid for-- a low-cost bullet mike.

I do however give them creds for the metal body and feel of the mike.  To be fair I think many beginning players or those involved in for-the-fun-of-it bands will find this acceptable for their needs at an affordable price.",1
3728,"The Wire Music stand is exactly what it states, a wire music stand.

The extension pieces for the stand, to enable it to be folded out, are of a thin wire like material. With extended use, it is possible that this is a stand that you cannot expect to last for a very long time. I guess the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" holds true here.

After some playing around with mine I finally got it to unfold. The supports for the top piece were you place the music, are pretty weak and were not caught together. I was actually afraid I was going to break it trying to get it to unfold the first time. I can see that if you place anything that is very heavy on this it could bend, or possibly break.
As for sturdiness, I would say it is pretty sturdy. I have not placed anything really heavy on it, but if you do, I can see that it could tip over. Even when you extend it there is a wing nut that tightens to hold it at the correct angle, but it is tightened onto a thin piece of metal. The base of the top, is pretty thin also. Basically don't put anything too heavy, or any really thick music book on this stand.

There are also page holders that fold over to hold down your pages. I find this very useful for my music books.

The legs are probably the strongest part of the whole thing. As long as you don't hit the stand, or put anything too heavy it should stay pretty sturdy. It holds up to my page turning and pressing the pages under the page holders.

The case is pretty good. It holds the folded up stand very well. You have to be sure to fold it up correctly to get it into the bag. It also comes with a strap that can be used for carrying.

Over all I am satisfied with the purchase. It performs what I want it to do and it was fairly cheap. I would have like to see a little more sturdy construction than it is. Overall if you are looking for something short term, longer term with proper care, this is a good cheap option. I would also recommend this item to any parent with a child taking up a music instrument. A parent may not know if their child will want to stick with the instrument for a long time, and they may not want to put a lot of money into a stand. That is where this could be of benefit.",1
3729,works ok,1

What I don't like about it is that it emits a cool light instead of a warm one. I prefer warm lighting.",1
3731,Didnt get the picks pictured,1
3732,Well made but many of the ends are a little misshapen and are hard to put in and pull out which can damage your equipment.,1
3733,It sounds okay. I actually prefer the stock pickup to this one. It has more output but less twang.,1
3734,Works fine but my acoustic pickups (passive) are too hot for it.  I will try an attenuator.  Otherwise it's fine.,1
3735,"This Fender Neckplate is much thinner than the original my P-Bass came with. The F logo is a great addition since I installed this on a MIM P-Bass. Once you start tightening you can feel and see it starts to bend, so just be carefull when you installed it. As I said, it's a great cosmetic upgrade but I still don't feel confortable being so thin.",1
3736,Ok,1
3737,"I bought the M5 to replace a number of pedals I tended to use one at a time (including a Line 6 FM4 synth unit).  I reasoned that if the M5 could dial up these same effects, I could downsize my board and all would be well.

From a sound perspective - no problem. As with all Line 6 products, the  patches are all excellent.  If I had to use just one pedal for studio work, this would be it.

Live performance is another story. It just isn't possible to switch between presets effectively by scrolling up or down.  The combination of the oddly reversed ""up"" and ""down"" footswitches and the weak LED display makes it impossible to use this pedal onstage - unless you only use 2-3 patches per set, which pretty much defeats the purpose of owning it.  My bandmates got irritated with the time it took between songs to dial up the requisite patch, which is understandable, since it's unprofessional.

I decided to sell mine on eBay and buy an M9, which gives you six presents at the tap of a button and a variety of ""scenes"" (i.e. ""banks"")of effects.  It's not just that the M9 is worth the extra money - it is - it's just that the M5 is unusable for this stage musician.",1

3743,"I had one of these but recently sold it. Why? IMO...It's just too difficult to operate. In addition, you need to use your hands to often to manually make some adjustments and control it. And I thought it was a bit noisy and colored by sound and tone too much.

If all you want is a SIMPLE looper for practicing or to make some multi-tracks I'd recommend the new TC Ditto Looper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TC-Electronic-Ditto-Looper-Guitar-Pedal/dp/B00AZUAORE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TC Electronic Ditto Looper Guitar Pedal</a>. Yes, it has less features BUT it is very, very simple to operate. Has just ONE control knob called ""Loop Level"" and the push/tap button - that's it.....

Here's the deal...One tap to record, tap again to loop. Tap again for overdub mode (keeps overdubbing over and over until you tap again to leave overdub mode). To undo/redo you tap and hold. You press once to record, press once again to play the loop. Press once to add another layer of sounds (something you can keep repeating until you run out of ideas). You press and hold to Undo a layer and press and hold again to Redo. Press twice to stop, after which you can press and hold to clear the loop. Simple? You betcha!

If you already have more than one layer, undo eliminates everything you recorded during the last overdub (could be many layers if you let it loop for a while in overdub mode), and redo brings it back. If you undo your first loop layer the unit simply stops and goes back to bypass mode. Double click to stop admittedly isn't the best situation, but it's not terrible. Personally the most inconvenient command for me is erasing - double tap and hold - however this command can be combined with stopping the loop. So if you know you are stopping the loop and you need to wipe what you recorded, you can do both at once with a double tap and hold until the unit goes back to bypass mode. So, if your needs are minimal and you'd rather spend your time playing and creating than reading manuals and getting frustrated maybe this is the best option for you. YMMV........it's NOT for everybody...but..it is for me!",1
3744,Now that I have used this a while. I can say this about it . I'm not impressed. Does not hold all the strings down as it should without a bit of adjusting each time just to get it just right so it will. I am restaring it to a 3 star buy.,1

This is not taking anything away from the Korg CA-40, just a personal opinion.  The Korg's quality is very evident.",1
3763,"it performs well...however, the unit came obviously used in some way. the rubber cable protector at the termination end was broken off and the unit had smudges and a hasty wrapping job around the pop filter. while the unit performs well and seems stable, the issues above diminished my confidence and makes me question quality control and the ethics of selling a (what seems to be) used item at full price.

Normally, I love shure and their products have been excellent. This is the first time I've gotten a less than great experience. I understand that the rating here should only reflect the units quality, but the unit itself came broken and used, and quality control is a MAJOR part of a products assessment.

So, the unit feels strong, stable, lightweight, very bendable and malleable, but again, sturdy and strong. It sounds fantastic and will be perfect for many applications including violin, voice etc.",1

Still way better than a gig bag, and way lighter than a hard case, and probably as good as you can do without spending twice as much for a Gibson case. I do like it better than the budget hard cases out there. Just don't expect anything amazing. External pockets are kind of meh, and the side handle is weird.

Itll do nicely for my casual transport needs, and is a big improvement over the nice but too-tight gibson gig bag that came with SG standards in 2016 (boo gibson!).

3812,"As far as tried and true distortion pedals go, this is really just average. The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion. Compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard. However, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is. Does it have distortion? Yes. Is it valuable as such? Not in my opinion. It isn't condensed enough to be used strictly as that. Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot. Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply. Not so with this pedal. You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux IMO, especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chain.
Anyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for. If you prefer to play a more grungy or 70's era metal, then this will work for you. For more crisp sound, you should look elsewhere. IMO",1

If you're a punk rocker, these are probably not for you.  Otherwise...they may do the trick.  The advantage is that you don't have to install anything, and they're quite easy to put on and remove.

I had always wanted an attack delay effect and the Behringer Slow Motion was priced well below all competitors. When it arrived, I tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope. It only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in. You can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly. Having said that, I found that the effect is nice, once you have mastered the technique. I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all. Other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal, which I have not tried. I considered returning the unit to Amazon for a refund, but I don't think that would be fair as it DOES work to some extent and it didn't cost me a lot of money in the first place.

3824,"Update: While I still like the sound of these the thin pads have become a comfort issue. After several days of use my ear drums hurt from the pressure as your ears basically sit on the driver. Purchased some HM5 pads and they created too much soundstage. An artificial sound similar to an orchestra hall preset in a software EQ. So, it looks like these will go back as they are just too uncomfortable. Overall clamping remains a non-issue. It's the damned pads with my ears sitting on the drivers. They would need to be somewhere in between the stock and the HM5's to work. Don't know of any. Giving them one more day.

Having owned these only for a short time, and with a few reviews citing a failure of the right channel on the T50, I cannot give them a five star rating, overall. Im worried about that. If it were based solely on sound alone, I would give them a five. To my ears, and open headphone collection, they are unique, and I am enjoying the early experience. They have a pleasing sound signature that differs from the rest of the open headphones I own. Slightly more closed than with less soundstage than you'd expect from an open, but very competent detail and separation. Was looking for something different to try and Planar Magnetic, in this headphone, was the right choice, at a great price.

People are understandably buying the semi-open T50 but these were slightly cheaper and more of an unknown. So I took a chance, intrigued by the marketing of ""deep bass"" that surely was a bit of a misnomer given that these are open headphones. These are the open variant of the MK3. The marketing flies in the face of what we hold true about closed/open/semi. Surely the T40 should be the bass monster.

What these do have over the T50 (going on reviews of those) is similar to Hifiman HE-400 bass. Defining, controlled mid-bass, with deep but not overwhelming low bass, all with layers. I am hearing elements of a string bass note, or hand drums like bongos, that I have not heard before.

 Highs can be a smidge bright at extremes - not a big deal - barely on the radar. The low bass can overwhelm in some songs or albums but that simply comes down to what happened in the studio, or the quality of the file. The right recording, of decent quality/bitrate, will lead to a perfectly refined bass experience.

Comfort: these definitely clamp and will be problematic for watermelon heads. I average 7 1/4 in hats and they fit nicely. I notice them but they are not fatiguing. I spent hours in them last night playing Fallout 4. Not ideal for gaming but competent enough if these were going to be your only pair of headphones.

Cable jack gets a lot of hate but the pair I have is tight and I cannot envision an issue unless you spent your time wearing it out. A nice mod project but not an actual issue.

These almost require an amp. You can get by without but are going to want one, idealy.",1
3825,"When you buy Behringer, you pretty much know what you're getting into.  They could just as well rename their brand ""3 Out Of 5 Stars Audio Equipment"".  This little amp does what it says, and its a nice cheap way to amplify up to 4 pairs of headphones.  I have to watch how strong of an input signal I feed this unit because it clips at higher input gains.  I noticed last night that it also distorts when driven too hard, but I was really pushing the level knobs into ear-shredding territory.

3833,"I like the smaller lines on this model compared to other Snark tuner models.  It's a bit more sensitive.  A bit cumbersome as compared to other clamp on type tuners but I like mine.  Maybe not the ultimate in accuracy but it is very close.

UPDATE:  After owning this tuner for several months and using it everyday, the screen display has gone blank.  If you tap on the screen, it will return.  However, if you are playing and the screen goes black, you don't necessarily have time to reach over and tap it until you can see the screen.

Overall, for the price, it is a really good tuner.  I can still afford to buy two more of these if they go bad as compared to a more expensive tuner.  The reliability is a bit lacking.  So, you'll have to decide for yourself if you want to risk having to replace it or not.",1

3839,"I haven't had a chance to use this in an actual performance with an audience so this review might change after that.  So far I've only used it solo at home.  At the outset I should point out that I already have a TC-Helicon Correct XT and a TC-Helicon MP-75 microphone.  So far this seems like to be duplicative of the Correct XT in many ways - the ""Tone"" function being the most important.  The ""tone"" function on both the Correct XT and the Perform V is an ""automagic"" combination of EQ, compression, de-essing and gating.  It's not adjustable,  either its on or its off.  You'll probably want to leave it on for most styles of singing,  but maybe not in some situations or genres.  When its on I notice more high end,  less boominess but also a slightly unpleasant digitized nature to the vocal.  Probably fine for pop music but if you're going for a more natural acoustic jazz sound (which I often do) maybe you should leave it off.

As I said,  I already have a Correct XT which does the same thing,  so the only advantage of the Perform V in that regard is that its mounted on your mic stand for easy access,  as opposed to the Correct XT which sits on the floor and has foot switches.  I had no trouble snapping it onto my mic stand and it sits in place firmly.  While the mic stand mounting of the Perform V does allow easier access,  that comes with a trade off.  Maybe its must my personal aesthetic taste, but the Perform V looks kind of cheap and plasticky with garish green lights.  Its like a smaller version of the old ""Simon"" memory toy is mounted on your mic stand.  Again in an acoustic jazz band setting, that might not be a desirable, professional or sophisticated look.

Another disappointment for me was that, unless I'm mistaken,  the TC-Helicon MP-75 vocal mic,  while ""compatible"" with the Peform V, does not seem to CONTROL the Perform V the way it can control the Correct XT.  There's a button on the mic that you can use to switch functions on the Correct XT.  It doesn't seem to do anything on the Perform V.

Otherwise it's a nice toy with echo, reverb, voice doubling and anti feedback available at the press of a button.  Its configurable to a degree in a live setting,  but you'll get more out of it by creating or downloading preset configurations ahead of time,  saving them in its onboard memory and then calling them up onstage.

Overall it seems to be a slightly less expensive,  slightly less professional version of the Correct XT.  If you're trying to decide between one or the other,  I'd probably go with the Correct XT.",1
3840,"Doesn't really have much output, and was kind of hard to fit to my guitar (a Recording King Dirty Thirties single O). Sits really far below the strings, and have tried to shim it up closer some, but not much change in output levels. String response is really uneven - the unwound strings are much louder. Adjustable poles would have been nice. Have a set of white bronze acoustic/electric strings on order, so will see if that helps some with these issues.

3850,"slick, small, and boosts my AT2020 wonderfully. Sometimes it drops my mic for no reason, but when it works the other 95% of the time, it's exceptional. Software installation can potentially be a hassle.

Update March 8, '15: Well, I had to continually plug and replug the usb Male B header into the preamp to get the sound working again. The little block that supports the pins is rather flimsy. It was late at night and I was frantically trying to get the sound working again because the preamp dropped my mic and monitor mid recording. Snapped off the little block in the usb header and bent the pins pins.

If you're someone who travels and has to continually plug and replug your usb port from the back of your solo, be careful. You could potentially damage usb header.

UPDATE March 9: Well, I found the little usb block lying on the floor, it's black, plastic, and cheap, and I kinda slipped it back into the header between the pins with a pair of tweezers. Surprisingly, it turns on now, but because I can't place the block in precisely, the poor connection's giving me a lot of noise. I guess this little preamp will make a nice desk ornament until I get it fixed",1

3853,"Presonus makes good products but they are a bit pricey when compared to the competition, with no apparent reasons for that. They all have pros and cons and similar quality. This unit, for example, is not designed to take line-level inputs, making it a little limiting if you want to connect a drum machine, keyboard, synthesiser or even an electric acoustic guitar with a built-in pre-amp. At least they are honest enough to tell you this in the manual (page 5).

You would need to buy the 44VSL to be able to connect active instruments, but it would cost you $300. A better option would be the NI Komplete Audio 6 for $230, or the Presonus Firestudio Mobile or the Focusrite Saffire 14 for about $250. These have more line-level connections on their backs.

The other small units from Mackie, Focusrite and Steinberg also offer the same quality (again, with pros and cons), but their inputs allow for line-level instruments. The Presonus 22 does not. They are also $50 cheaper. Some have Midi connection, others don't. Some offer USB 1.1, while others have USB 2.0. You will need USB 2.0 or Firewire if you plan to record more than two tracks at the same time (if you have more than two inputs, of course). The new Steinberg UR 22 is a great unit for $150, however, it allows the connection of only one guitar without a DI box, i.e., it has only one Hi-Z input.

At the end, think twice before buying these interfaces. You need to know exactly what you will (or may) be playing and what you want to do while recording. Many of these units were launched years ago, so can we expect some upgrades in terms of hardware soon?!?! I hope so. There are still a lot of obsolete equipment out there that allows multiple inputs but only two tracks recording due to the limited connection (USB 1.1) and design. I am now getting into the mixer/interface combo world, but this would be a more expensive option.

Anyway, good luck in your search for the ""perfect"" low cost interface. Do your research. Get to know the unit's inputs, connection to the computer, sampling rate, the ""bit"", quality of the pre-amps, etc. You will need all of this to make a sound decision.",1

3855,"This violin was in my shopping cart (saved for later) for several weeks. Suddenly I saw a price drop and the order was sent.

Mendini/Cecilio violins are in general not rated as good as Cremona violins based on Amazon customer reviews. I have the 1/4 size Cremona SV-150, which is not bad for its price when I bought it ($103). For the 1/2 size one, which I like to get in advance to my daughter's arm growth, I want something in a different brand and something higher in its series. The Mendini MV650 is much more in its original price than the SV-150, because it is in the top of its lines. I paid more, even after the deep discount ($131), than I paid for the SV-150 as well. After playing with the violin for a couple of days, I should say I don't regret to have purchased this violin, but not too excited either. Here is a list of the good and bad things with my copy of this 1/2 size violin.

Pros:
1. The body of the violin is in decent quality. The paint job is not bad. I like the 1-piece back and the varnish finish.
2. Two bows are better than one, although they are not in high quality.
3. The sound is good both in terms of volume and quality, after I put on a new set of D'Addario J810 Prelude strings.
4. I like the compact case, which is slim but provides good protection. One can carry the case like a backpack.
5. There is a yellow handkerchief that came with the violin. It is not mentioned in the description but a very good one to have.
6. Low price paid. Price is always a top consideration in rating a product, because if you pay more you could always get better products.

Cons:
1. Extremely poor quality of the strings that came with the violin. E string broke into several pieces when I tried to just tighten it, due to rusts. The spare set is of the same make hence the same poor quality. I don't even bother to try them.
2.  As far as I can see, none of the fittings are made of true ebony. The finger board is made of some kind of wood, which is not naturally black but painted semi-black. The others: chin rest, tailpiece, and pegs are made of some kind of composite materials.
3. The finger board is not aligned with the center line of the violin body. Its end slightly points to the left.
4. The accessory tuner is also not a good one. I bought that before separately and returned it later.
5. The shoulder rest is useless.
6. The rosin is a not a cake, but a cheap looking bar.
7. The bows are in poor quality compared with the violin. I would rather have one good bow than two cheap bows.",1
3856,"So I've been a guitar music lover - (EVH is my favorite, but love all the 80's metal and some of the new stuff as well, plus regular rock and some blues, etc) - since I was a kid. Now I'm 51, and this year I decided ""this is the year I learn to play..."". So I bought this beginners kit because it seemed like a good value. I was torn between the Les Paul kit and this one (similar price) but I went with this one because I love whammy bars and this one does have the humbuckers...

My impressions:

Well, first of all, there were no instructions whatsoever on how to set up the guitar - I mean it had a couple layers of plastic and one layer ""shrink wrapped"" around the guitar body. I was not sure if I was supposed to remove the bottom layer - or how to remove it (because it was very much ""attached"" to the guitar and also stuck under a bunch of screws). After a couple of youtube videos that were kinda hard to find, I finally found what I was looking for (instructions on how to remove the plastic without damaging the guitar). Besides that, there was a large spring and an allen wrench in the box. No instructions on what they are/were for. I'm pretty sure I don't really need them. The box also had a CD for beginners, a tuner, the amp, the necessary cables, and a ""gig-bag"".

1. The guitar itself is pretty nice I guess. Again, I am a beginner so I don't have much to compare it too. But it seems well-made and it sounds fine to me. And it looks pretty good (although I wish I would have noticed the option for the red one!). But this guitar seems good for learning on.

2. The tuner is pretty crappy. After messing with it for a while and having a hard time getting it to ""hear"" the guitar right (it never seemed to say certain strings were in tune no matter how much I tried)... I finally looked in the Apple iPhone App store for a tuner... yep, there is an awesome free one that works fantastic! So, I tossed this tuner in the trash.

3. The amp works great for leaning and practicing. I live in an apartment, so I have not really turned it up past 3 or 4 - but I think this thing could be used with a band for a small venue.

4. The gig bag is okay. It's not super cheapo looking or feeling... but it's not super high quality either.

5. The CD seemed a bit useless to me, the ""lessons"" were too fast pace for me and seemed to be geared toward someone who knew a little bit about what they were doing.

So overall I am happy with the guitar and amp. It's a great value for a nice looking, well-made, good sounding guitar. Perfect for a beginner. I would have given it 4 stars if it would have came with instructions on how to get the guitar up and running, and 5 stars if it would have came with some good lessons for true beginners.

I did find some great guitar lessons in YouTube (surefire) that were free (they will be about $15 if I want to go further with them). So after 2 weeks of watching the short videos and playing for about 20 minutes a day, I've learned 3 chords and I am getting better at strumming and picking individual strings without looking... and I am still working on moving between those 3 chords smoothly and thoughtlessly. Anyway... my dream is coming true, not matter how long it takes!

Overall I am happy with the guitar.",1

They are easy to install, easy on the fingers, and really fairly priced (check with local stores of course).

However, the sound was just faded, like someone turned it down a notch and you wished they would crank it back up. Also, there is a little less definition to the sound.

3861,"I just received this item 2 days ago. I hooked it up in my small practice studio downstairs at my house. My wife has long banished me there. Well I was very shocked at how well it sounds after reading some less than favorable probably overly critical behrenger reviews.
 Someone talked about how the compressors are hissy and overly loud for live use. I couldn't agree less. When the compressor is turned up too high, you will here a little high noise(a little). Its if you are standing right near a speaker. At about half way or a little less it is absolutely amazing what it does for a vocal. It doesn't rob all the dynamic range and puts the vocal right out there and big, just like a well tuned separate compressor does. Along with my tc helicon mic mechanic which also has a small amount of compression, the sound is fantastic. Difficult to describe how good actually. My vocal, my Roland keyboard module and MP 3 player all fit nicely in this tiny mixer. I cant overstate how good this Behringer mixer sounds. Well, the power cord with any slight movement at all falls out. Yes...this is the problem, apparently others have experienced this. At least one reviewer said his does not do this. Sadly I have to return mine. I already ordered a Behringer 1204 usb from Guitar center. I hope this model is free from this issue. I wish I could be sure if it was the power pack or the mixer insert point that causes this. Again the acual mixer performance is huge.",1

3863,"Make sure you purchase the OPTIONAL power supply which adds an additional $15+ to the cost of the keyboard. Granted, this product is really just a toy, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect Yamaha to include a power supply.",1
3864,"As a straightforward (monophonic) tuner the Polytune works well-enough, although the clip hinge has less mobility (i.e. no swivel) than some smaller clip-on tuners which makes headstock positioning more critical.

Im a lefty and, whatever gyro-detection its using, the tuner really does flip the displayed pitch letters - a nice touch to an already bright, easy-to-read display  at least in basic Strobe mode.

But a combination of unfortunate design choices and poor instructions left me with a mixed impression.

The larger power button along the narrow side of the tuner is easy to press with minimal force while Im wearing the guitar in playing position. But the two buttons on the longer edge, one to toggle the display between Strobe and Needle modes, and the other to select chromatic pitches are both too small and recessed too far into the case to be comfortable and easy to press. I have to jam my fingernail to press them and for one particular function  setting the reference pitch - you have to hold both down simultaneously, which is a neat trick to pull off.

I wish there were more rubber on the spring clip arm surface and directly in front of the spring. Its not difficult to scrape that exposed metal along the edge of a headstock where any finish provides less protection. Id recommend thin electrical tape to cover those areas without impacting smooth operation.

I agree with a point made in the instructions about not keeping the tuner attached permanently, especially in direct sunlight (Id add very warm/hot environments). Rubber and lacquer don't play well under heat  I learned the hard way by damaging a vintage Gibson finish by leaving a guitar on a stand with rubber contacts in a hot room several summers back.

As far as the display of polyphonic 6-string tuning of chords, it only seems to appear and remain briefly before the tuner reverts to monophonic mode and registers what must be the fundamental chord pitch. You strum a chord and see six pairs of alignment bars that stay until the chord resolves itself to its most present pitch, which in root position tends to be the root of the chord.

Rather than full chords, I tune to a variety of double stops and triads: mostly octaves, 5ths, 4ths and 3rds. Every guitar intonates differently depending on a host of factors and, to be honest, at this point I rely on my ears more than a tuner once I have a reference pitch.

But I was curious to see how the Polytune handled intervals:

Sure enough, the full chord behavior of reverting the display to the fundamental seems to apply to smaller two and three note dyads and triads - except the polyphonic display doesnt appear at all. When I play ascending fifths simultaneously the bottom tone always displays in the tuner. If I play the higher fifth immediately after sounding the pair, so long as the bottom tone is still sounding the tuner continues to register it. As soon as I stop sounding the lower pitch, the upper pitch registers.

This applies to fourths (inverted fifths) as well. When playing G-C ascending as a double stop the C registers in the tuner and will continue so long as its sounding.

If I tune to a full five or six string chord (usually the last step in the process, just to confirm) Im listening for particular pitches that are off, which may or may not be the root. The tuner isn't helping me by confirming the root is in tune if other pitches are out.

Im willing to accept I may be missing something here, but the instructions are so minimal  and I consider myself fairly savvy about equipment, having played for many years  that I just fail to see the value beyond a basic monophonic tuner that works well with a display that I'd say is  steps above those tiny monochrome LED chicklet-sized clip-on tuners.

Bottom Line: Im not sure if theres adequate value here, but the display and response for single-string tuning is certainly adequate.
As for me, if I have to use a tuner, I grab my old-school Korg AT1-AC from the 80s, with the long cord and clip-on sensor thats perfect for guitar, mandolin, and fiddle  it still works fine and the back-lit needle is even easier for me to read and I know its response very well.",1

3870,"I picked this up to try with my Yamaha Acoustic  LL6. It is plugged into a Fender Champion 20 and does what its suppose to do and that is amplify the sound of your guitar. You really have to play with the knobs on the amp to get the sound you are looking for and play with the positioning of the pickup on your guitar. I found that I can get the best sound with the pickup on an angle. For some reason as with another buyer of this product, the B string has a much louder electric sound than the rest of the strings. It is really apparent when you play the B string open. The B string actually sounds electric as opposed to the other strings so you have a tendency to change your picking when playing that section of strings. (Yamaha LL6 acoustic guitar). I think I might order the Woody and see which one gives me more of an even tone across all the strings and send one of them back. This was not purchased for the price but all the 5 star reviews. I do not mind paying the price for the Woody if it will give a more even sound across all strings. Not sure I would recommend this product unless I got a bad one. Will update when the Woody gets here.
FOLLOW UP:
Big difference for a little more money. Bought the HDE Guitar Pickup Acoustic / Electric Transducer along with a Fender Champion 20 amp. The HDE worked, but really gave the B and E strings a much louder pickup than the others. I went on you tube to check out some other options and saw some reviews on the Seymour Duncan Woody single coil pickup. It seemed to have a much better overall sound than the HDE so I ordered one and I think there is a big difference and well worth the extra $15.00. It has more of an amplified acoustic overall sound and the B string is a lot softer than the HDE. The 14 foot cord is beefy and it has a quality 1/4 inch plug.
There were some comments that you need an amp bigger than 20 watts to make this work. NOT TRUE! My vol is set to a 7 out of 10 on the vol and 4 out of 10 on the gain and works just fine on my practice amp. (I do not play in a band, just bang my strings at home) I am very happy with this combination with out having to buy and electric guitar at least for now. I have a Yamaha LL6 acoustic guitar and with this pickup I have have the best of both worlds. If you want perfection than go to you-tube and see the reviews of the ones that cost a few hundred dollars. Enjoy!
PS: For the money and the different sound it produces, I am not returning the HDE.",1

3883,"UPDATE: The street prices for the DR-60D have dropped significantly since this review was written. At the current price, it's well worth considering this unit as an alternative to an all-in-one recorder like the DR-40. It's still heavier and more complex, but no longer all that much more expensive an option.

The Tascam DR-60D is a great field audio recorder -- but it's basically a slightly more compact (and heavier!) version of Tascam's also terrific, much cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DR-40-field-recorder/dp/B005NACC6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DR-40 field recorder</a>&nbsp;with a few slight modifications, with a few more inputs and outputs and without the DR-40's built-in mics.  It's trying to be everything you want in a camera-mounted recording rig, and it almost succeeds; but the DR-40 is still well worth considering.

The form factor is nicely compact, though not as much smaller than the DR-40 as I expected.  It's made of solid plastic; the rails appear durable, but the battery door and camera mount do not seem like they'd take much slamming around.  I'd only consider using the DR-60D as a camera mount on a very stable tripod, someplace that's not likely to be bumped too hard.  For that use it should do fine without a camera cage; anything else, and I'd want more durability.

The DR-60D has enough inputs to do almost anything you'd want, and records 4 tracks simultaneously, but the safety-track facility (where it records 2 duplicate tracks at a lower volume level) is so useful that I'd suggest most news/documentary users stick to 2 tracks if possible.  This feature can save a shoot.  Having 4 separate tracks of inputs is an advantage over the DR-40 (though the DR-40's built-in mics are actually good enough for camera-mounted use), but if you're doing serious multitrack recording, you probably want a more capable recording system than this anyhow, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoom-H6/dp/B00DFU9BRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoom H6</a>.

Even for the DR-60D's targeted use of camera-mounted audio for DSLR video shooting, I'm not sure I'd necessarily choose it over the fantastic DR-40 (or the slightly more expensive alternatives from Zoom).  The difference in price between the two is almost enough to add a decent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/camera-cage/dp/B009ZXHWLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">camera cage</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/video-mic/dp/B00CAE8PM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">video mic</a>&nbsp;to your shooting setup.

Compared to my other boy's nylon strap, I like the cotton one, but the rest of the buckles and tabs are inferior.  Also, there's no pick pocket as shown.  The tabs are pretty cheap.  Overall, we like it though..

Update: the tabs on this are not stiff enough, so the one on the back of the guitar folds over and pops off.  I'll have to use strap locks on it.

Pros...
seems to hold most standard microphones
Cheap

Cons...
Cheap Tightening mechanism (Don't put a valuable mic in this)

I've been a recording musician for a few years and own a wide variety of gear including shock mounts. I feel informed to compare this to other products and tell you where it falls short. This shock mount does what it is supposed to. Keeps a condenser safe from shock, and vibration while in use on a stand. Noise from touching a mic stand is immediately reduced wile implementing this device. This shock mount however has a somewhat fatal flaw. If you look in the picture you will see a joint that allows you to adjust the angle of the microphone with a standard twist to tighten mechanism. This is cheap and becomes ""untightened"" easily. The shock mount has swung down several times due to this problem, shaking the mic. I guess that's not the worst thing seeing  as it's in a shockmount that's supposed to absorb the blow but I still feel uneasy about this. If you would like to hear some music that I used this shockmount in while recording go to the following link...

https://clyp.it/g4lvbndn

All in all this is a good budget shockmount.",1
3901,"Works as billed, with nice, bright multi-colored flashes (I bought the rainbow one).  Comes in a really nice box, and might make an interesting gift for the guitarist who has everything.  However, the pick is very thick (thicker than any I've ever seen or used), and the charge doesn't last long; I only used it for maybe 30 minutes, then moved to a thinner and larger pick (it's not a very big pick either - I'd call it a small).  The following day, the pic was flat (i.e., doesn't seem to hold charge).",1
3902,"Cable works fine and doesn't kink. The RIGHTS ANGLE end is about 1/4"" too long and locks in, but sticks out and remains loose. Works fine for home use, or on a stationary pedal board but I wouldn't recommend it for a gig, or your guitar if you are active.",1

The Neck pickup is pretty dark, and lacks volume and clarity. The bridge pickup is louder, and brighter than the neck. I've had both better, and worse pickups... these are just alright. If I had it to do all over again, I probably would have just left the stock pickups in the guitar. It's not worth sending back, as the product does actually work, and tone is such a personal and subjective thing. I'm rating three stars as a neutral rating.",1

This set up is not too much more expensive, and has much better reverb, built-in compression and can handle more volume.  I *wish*
I could use the Stagepas though, because it would save me some back pain - it's much more portable than my system.

I still use the Stagepas at home though, for small impromptu jam sessions, when I don't want to lug in the big speakers from
the garage.

So what were the problems with the Stagepas? First of all, the reason the speakers are so lightweight is because the amplification
happens on the mixing console.  This means the mixing console generates a lot of heat, so it's built with a cooling fan.  On my unit,
that cooling fan was LOUD.  Listeners in the audience didn't really notice it, but poor sensitive me, sitting at the mixing console,
noticed it, and found it quite distracting.  This was the main problem.

The on-board reverb sounds like a great feature, but it's really a terrible sounding cheap digital reverb, and I pretty much avoid
using it.  I found the on-board effects on the Yamaha MG82cx to be much better sounding (it has about 8 different reverbs).

So, to sum up:

PROS:  Very portable.  Not too expensive.
CONS:  Loud fan on the mixer, useless reverb.",1

I tried three different rigs to supply phantom power. Same result with all of them.

I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone.

My first check determined I did not have any bow and a slight turn on the truss nut end, showed me I had made the right direction turn. One adjustment later, my neck showed just a slight concave dip and a slight buzz from my low E was gone.  Worth the $16.99 right there.  I know someone out there, doesn't want to do any little thing to their guitar, if only from lack of confidence or knowledge of setup, but today you can watch so many videos to tune up a guitar, the doing or undoing of a little adjustment, it will become obvious to them they can do it.

3921,"First off, I have 14 amps from a Marshall stack to a lowly Rogue G-10 and all are combos except for the Marshall.
With this said, I have the amps here to compare one against the other.
I have found that a lot of buyer loyalty will attach to an amp that you have just spent at least $300.00 on even if it is not that great an amp unless you have a few amps to compare it with on a full time bases; not just by stopping by your local music shop, and is actually more apparent with amps than with guitars; go figure.
Over half of my amps are Fender, so let's put that to rest as I am not a Fender hater; just the opposite.

I have had both the Junior (15Watt) and 30 (30watt) G-DEC's for a few years now.
Both have changed there names and look a little different, and Fender has added the digital readout/select and the expanded 3.0 30 stuff to make a 3.0 15. So what you have is a 3.0 line with digital menus and a junior carbon and a non carbon junior which are both 15's.
Personally, I think they went the wrong direction by adding the digital junk to the 15. What they should have done is to add a couple more dial selects (like the carbon and non carbon juniors) to the 30.
If what you want is a small no hassle amp to practice your guitar playing on, that gives you amp selections, effects, and a selection of loop backing tracks to play your rhythm or lead with and is quick and simple to do your selections through dials, has an actual metronome, and won't break the bank, the junior carbon and non carbon is your amp.
If what you want is something to play with through a digital display that take you away from the
main reason you are there holding that guitar, then get one of the G-DEC 3.0 line.
Don't get me wrong, the 30 (or now 3.0 15 and 30) have great throughput and output capabilities, but require a lot of time going through display menus and sub menus to get the job done and while this can be fun, the main reason for both of these machines is to practice your guitar playing, and at the much higher price tag for the 3.0 line, well, it's a no brainer; at least for me who has used both for over 5 years.
Again, all of these machines are for practice, they are not meant for gigs even though the 30/3.0 line could be used for small venues.
If you do plan to do gigs with a modeling/practice amp, I would go with the Line-6 Jam for another $100.00, as it has both 12"" and 2"" speakers and a full 75Watts which makes it a much better gig machine, is not that much larger than the G-Dec 30, and has superior controls over the backing/modeling capabilities.
Oh! by the way, I have a little used G-Dec 30 for sale.",1
3922,"I purchased a couple of these for possible use with harmonia playing through a mike. The hope was that they would be fairly transparent to sound while eliminating the sound of metal clanking on metal.

Alas, the foam does in fact eliminate the clanking, but it also deadens the harmonics associated with different notes. The result is a  significant loss of depth and warmth in the sound that the foam actually lets through. Matters are slightly better with vocals, but harmonics are still deadened. The foam itself is also not of terribly high quality and is unlikely to survive regular use for more than a couple of months (unless it is just permanently left in place on the mike).

Under these circumstances, I can't give this higher than three stars in spite of the low cost of this item. Sometimes nothing at all is a preferable choice to something that does its job poorly.",1

3926,"I wanted something to add some bass presence to a Dreadnought-style acoustic guitar (with a thin-line under-saddle transducer), since our bass player moved away, and thought that the ""doubling"" effect of the Ultra Octaver would do it.  It does what it's designed for (it can double the note one octave or two octaves below the string played).  It works OK if you play one note at a time, so to speak.  Play a low ""E,"" for example, and you hear the ""E"" with an""E"" an octave lower, and if you use both circuits, an ""E"" below THAT one, too. Ditto the rest of the strings.

But if you try an old-fashioned Carter-style flat-picking ""boom-chuck,"" that is, bass string followed by a brush of the rest of the chord, the effect is muddy and crashy.  I suppose I was trying to make it do something it wasn't designed for, so I can't fault the pedal--I was trying to use it ""off-prescription,"" and it didn't work for me. It doesn't seem to be designed for an acoustic instrument, and definitely not for the old-timey style (bluegrass, pre-bluegrass, old-time country on a flattop) that I tried to use it for.

Replacing that with the EP booster did not have a significant impact on my tone. Yes it was a little colored, but not too different from the line booster.
If at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run, yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal. I didn't find it magical though, because I've always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different.

3933,"I bought this cable for my 4 string cigar box guitar (sometimes referred to as CBG. I recommend a CBG builder on youtube called Weeklyhouse. I've bought three guitars from him).

The right angle input jack on one end of the Pig Hog fits well, and I can lay the guitar down against my amp, with the bottom end on the carpet, more easily than with a straight end cable.

Cables can really effect how an instrument sounds when hooked up to an amp. I compared the tone using a Pro Co Lifelines cable, 20 ft., with two straight ends. This is the cable I use for my regular electric guitar. There is a Pro Co 10 ft. cable with one angled end here on Amazon for $5 more than the cost of this Pig Hog cable. I don't know if having one right angle end will make a big difference in sound. I'm guessing the Pro Co equivalent will be better than this one, but I don't know for sure.

Gosh can I hear the difference between the Pro Co cable I have, and the Pig Hog. The Pro Co has a fuller sound. The Pig Hog, a bit less full, and a bit more compressed. Sort of like the difference between the sound of a humbucker pickup on an electric guitar, and a single coil - but not quite that dramatic. The sound with the Pig Hog is also a bit less bright.

I did some research online to try and figure out which amp would be best for a cigar box guitar. Almost everyone recommended a 3W Roland Micro Cube battery powered amp - so that is what I bought, and what I used for the sound test.. clean and distorted settings, with and without chorus, delay and reverb. (Amazon rechargeable AA batteries and a charger are a very smart purchase if you buy this amp - you'll need six batteries if you don't want to use the amp's power adapter).

I fretted the strings with my fingers, and also used a glass bottle slide. I mostly played with a pick during the sound test.

I have mixed feelings about this cable.. sometimes I prefer the Pro Co sound, and sometimes the Pig Hog. But the Pig Hog definitely makes the sound worse than the Pro Co if I've dialed in a distortion setting, especially when combined with effects.. With the gain fairly low, or using a clean setting, the Pig Hog tone is pretty good, even when I have chorus and/or reverb turned on.

I like how the Pig Hog, being woven, does not tangle. The Pro Co, not being woven, gets tangled easily.

Pig Hog - Not a terrible cable. It is decent, though if I knew how it would effect the sound coming through the amp, I would not have bought it.  The sound is not bad, but not great, hence the 3 star rating. I'm an amateur guitarist, and have been using Pro Co Lifelines for years with my electric guitars and basses. Good cables for the price.

This Pig Hog cable.. eh.. good enough for now, I guess. I have my CBG and tiny amp in a corner of my room. I don't like using my 20 ft. straight end Pro Co cable with my CBG - too long and awkward -  and I don't feel like buying another angled cable at this point in time. So I'll be keeping the Pig Hog cable, I suppose.",1

  But don't be discouraged from buying this guitar. The frets are smooth and even and the neck is straight.
  THE NECK FEELS FANTASTIC!!!!
 The bridge is perfectly aligned and glued tight.  The headstock, tuners, & body's finish are great.  It handles well and the action was perfect on my guitar.  I didn't even need to change the strings.  Unfortunately..........THE OVERALL SOUND IS LACKING!!!
  This is due to the cheap wood used in it's construction.  It has a metallic sound when you play it - not warm enough sounding for an acoustic.
  This guitar is perfect for the absolute beginner.  Especially if you aren't sure you're going to really pursue music or if your kid may not stick it out.  But not for a regular player or someone that has a discerning ear.  You will hear the difference between this guitar and other budget guitars that contain a solid wood top.",1

3951,"I ordered this kit from Amazon for something to do. It arrived in just a few days of the order. I did some internet research on this product, part fit, quality of parts, etc. I did a dry fit when I recieved it and found that the tuners were all for the same side. Also the wiring is not very good, try to re-soder some ends that you feel are questionable. If you want the wood grain to come out on the top of this guitar get out a grinder ! The sealer that they put on is about a 1/16 of an inch thick, if that stuff was paint I would have it on my car and never worry again about a rock chip ! Otherwise use Duplo-color automotive paint. The neck was a nice tight fit just like it should be. When you get this kit the neck will be tight, to install it lay the body down on a table or flat surface, line the neck up and push straight down. Since I needed new tuners and I had read to many times to count that SAGA is of no help I ordered my parts through Amazon. Gotoh tuners from Musicans Friend, Ernie Ball regular slinky's from Amazon, Graph Tech Tusq nut from Ant Hill Music, and all arrived in just a few days after order.
The neck had a little dip in it but it adjusted out just fine. The instructions are easy. I set it up the same as my Les Paul and to my surpise it sounds pretty damn good. So with the add on's my $215.00 kit guitar is worth about $375.00 and sound's like a $500.00 guitar. Have fun with it, it's a good product if you have some time and want to learn more about guitar building. If you don't then buy a guitar that's all done and ready to go for about the same investment.",1

3957,"Seydels take some getting used to. These harmonicas are much thicker, longer and wider than models made by Hohner, Lee Oskar, etc. A wider harp will feel differently. You'll have to open your mouth wider to play this one. It will feel quite strange to those of you who are used to other harmonicas. Also, if you have small hands, these might seem a bit too big for you to hold comfortably. If you have small hands, Hohner and Lee Oskar models are a better choice.

I really like tone. This is not a loud harp. It's more mellow and fuller sounding than a Hohner. In my opinion, it's even softer than the Special 20, which also has a plastic comb, and non-vented cover plates. But you can play this one plenty loud if you want to. It's versatile.

Best for blues? I would say probably not. You can likely get a meaner sound out of a harp by a different brand. Good enough for blues? Certainly. One reviewer on youtube who plays blues says that when he plays a harmonica while using a mic, he always chooses a Seydel, because it sounds the best amplified. Just one guy's opinion, of course, but I thought I'd pass it along.

If you want to play old-timey, straight harp, country, hymns, or Celtic music, then this harp is an excellent choice. I don't play that much blues, at least not yet, so I really dig the Seydel. When I want a more gritty tone, I play a Fender Blues DeVille. I those Fenders, and they are only $30 if you look hard enough.

Special 20.. yeah.. good harp.. this one and the BD are my main harmonicas. Since the Special 20 has somewhat similar tone to the Seydel (though not as full) and is cheaper and more comfortable to play, I'd say buy a SP20 instead of this one, unless you really want something different, and don't mind paying almost twice as much.

Mustache friendly? In my experience, yes. No problems. However, I read another review stating that this harp really snagged a guy's mustache bad. I suppose it depends on your mustache.

Two things that aren't so great that you might want to consider:

1. This harp does not come with a plastic case like most other harmonicas do. Included with the harp is a thin leather sleeve that you slide the harp into. The harmonica will fit very snugly, and even be a bit difficult to pull out of the sleeve, so don't jam it in there.

I think sending along a vented plastic case would be a better idea than a little leather sleeve. But, the harp does fit better in my pocket this way. If you want extra protection for the harmonica, stick it in the sleeve, and put it in the cardboard box it came in. Or, if you have a Hohner Big River Harp, use the case that came with it. The Seydel fits in the Big River case. I've tried this.

Also, it is possible to buy a zippered case if you want one, but you'll have to order it from the manufacturer. The case looks similar to the one that comes with a Hohner Crossover. I wish Seydel would include this case, considering the harp costs almost $60.

2. I have read that because of the size and shape of this harmonica, it will not fit in a harmonica rack. And Seydel doesn't make one, as far as I know. So no playing the guitar and harmonica at the same time. No Bob Dylan or Neil Young for you. Bummer.

Something good.. you can buy reed plates, and individual reeds. You can also get combs in a variety of colors and materials. Those of you who like customizing will really have a blast.

Besides owning a Blues Session Steel in the key of C, I had one in A and one in G. Are these worth the money? Sometimes I feel they are, but sometimes feel they aren't. This is due to the awkwardness of playing, and me not liking the tone as much as I did at first.

Another thing I would like to add, and this is important. There is a cheaper Seydel model called the Blues Session Standard. According to the listings on Amazon, the Standard being sold here is tuned a little differently than most harmonicas. The blow note on the #3 hole is higher than on other harps.

This is called ""Paddy Richter"" tuning. It is good for Celtic music. On the Seydel website, there is nothing mentioned about the Blues Standard only being available in Paddy Richter. So why is the Standard listed on Amazon as having a higher #3 note? I don't know! If you choose to buy a Standard, might not want to buy one here on this site. Maybe Amazon just got the listing wrong. It happens.

I don't own any Blues Session Standards, so I can't comment on those.

Is this a very good harmonica? That depends on whether or not you can get past how awkward it feels to play. If all you play are Seydels, this shouldn't be an issue. If you play various models and made by different brands, this one might really get on your nerves because of its size. I eventually got tired of my Seydels and sold them (listed as ""used"") on ebay. I'm content with my Special 20's and Blues DeVilles. Both of those have good to great tone, and both are more comfortable to hold and play than this harmonica.",1
3958,"Not the best.  It works, but I should have spent an extra $2 for the On-Stage Model that I bought before.  If you're really on a budget, this will work, but if you have an extra $2, then try On Stage XCG4 Black Tripod Guitar Stand, Single Stand.",1
3959,"After owning its predecessor (The Mk2) for over a year, I decided to get another monitor speaker. I went with the MK3 because I love and still use the MK2.

To my disappointment, the mk3 at  peak volume is not louder than the MK2 at halfway volume. I do not recommend this speaker. I am hoping I can return it and get another MK2 instead.

The feel is also ""darker"" (compared to the mk2). Example: when playing Salsa, the MK2 delivers a life-like sound to the trumpets, cowbell, maracas and anything that's handled by the tweeter. The MK3, however, sounds a bit muffled and electronic. I'm guessing they are using lower quality components and hoping people only use these for modern hiphop or EDM.

Before you ask ""maybe the unit you got was bad?"", I thought so too. I had returned it and got a new one sent to me. Same exact sound quality.
If you've never had the mk2, these may sound ok to you.  If I had nothing to compared these monitors to, then they would get 4 or 5 stars.",1
3960,"Based on a previous review, I had hoped yo set the speaker height to about 40"". The minimum height is actually about 5 feet. Other than that they are about what I expected.",1
3961,"But still it seems a little flimsy compared to my green .88 Tortex picks.  My go-to are the green .88 Tortex but I was wanting something around the holding area with some texture to keep it from slipping - this pick has it, but it just doesn't seem as firm.",1
3962,"It does a great job blocking the p's and s's, but it's hard to get the thing to stay in the exact position you want it to.",1
3963,"I found out later that it's not made in the USA and I had to drill out the post holes just to make it work. I wish I had done thing different but live and learn. Now the good part, they work and eliminate any string drag when using a Bigsby. All in all I can live with it....",1
3964,"This capo is okay. Just okay. It's inexpensive. You can clamp it on the headstock when not in use. It goes on quickly and holds the strings firmly. A little too firmly, though. Tension is not adjustable, and I've noticed some of the strings sounding sharp when I put this on. I think this would be problematical in performance, for example if you had to stay in tune with the other instruments in the band.

If your budget allows only one capo, buy a Shubb -- it is definitely worth the extra money. This one has its merits, but you still get what you pay for.",1
3965,"I like my strap right around 53-54"".  I bought a Levy's suede and it was too short.  I bought this thing and it is way too long.  Like 67 1/2"" hole to hole, more than is stated in the description.  All the extra material is unwieldy.  I can't be the only one with this problem, being average height and weight.  I know they are in Canada, using weird units of measure, but Levy's needs to be more accurate with their measurements.  Also consider making the cutoff a little longer for all the normal-sized products.  I have their basic black leather strap and it comes in a few inches longer than 54"" and would be perfect for most people.  I realize I might seem insane quibbling about an inch here or there but I am very detail-oriented when it comes to my guitars and I don't think it's unreasonable with so many people ordering over the internet to post accurate length descriptions.",1
3966,"On the upside, this does what it promises: With the Level and Tone knobs between 9:0012:00 clock positions, the 12-string effect is surprisingly convincing  although a bit dry, because there's no detune control. (Definitely more convincing than my Variax guitar's 12-string model was, before I edited it to de-emphasize the warbly octave effects.)

Also, by dropping both knobs below 9:00, you can dial in a more-subtle doubling effect. This can nicely fatten up the tone of a guitar that lacks a certain, je ne sais, cojnes.

On the downside, my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoom-MS100BT-MultiStomp-Guitar-Pedal-with-Bluetooth/dp/B00AJHHWIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoom MS100BT MultiStomp Guitar Pedal with Bluetooth</a>&nbsp;cost the same price. And in 15 minutes, I found I could build a 12-string model on the Zoom that's considerably more convincing. It's also vastly more flexible, because instead of 2 knobs, it's 5 rows of effects  each with multiple parameters to tweak. And the Zoom has room for 49 more presets.

So I'm back to my usual conclusion: Everyone who plays any electric instrument deserve at least one Zoom MS100BT. Best pedal I've ever bought in capabilities, flexibility, slim size/weight, and value.",1
3967,Really small to work.,1
3968,Very good quality cables but super thick to a fault. I had to stop using them because a normal pedal board can not handle the bulk.,1
3969,"The Donner delay pedal was purchased for use on a practice level pedalboard. At $35, my performance expectations for this unit were not extremely high, but I did expect it to be functional. On that level, the Donner delay delivers - pardon the alliteration. It wouldn't be fair to compare the Donner to my TC Electronic Flashback. If the Donner was the first delay pedal I had ever bought, I imagine I would be thrilled and couldn't wait to show it off. I got what I paid for. I can get a fat enough sound out of it to keep it around as a second string player, but it's not ready for prime time.
Now, the technical stuff: The delay pedal appears to be true bypass as I can't detect any degradation in tone or volume when the pedal is off. The 'Time' knob that regulates the speed at which the sound repeats is not extremely sensitive. As you dial a faster echo rate (turning the knob counterclockwise), the echo rate does increase but intensity of the sound seems to drop off. Once the 'Time' knob is turned clockwise about half way in order to slow down the echo rate, turning it farther to the right past that halfway point doesn't continue to slow the rate that much. Also, when the 'Feedback' knob (number of repetitions/echoes) is turned so that three or more echoes can be heard, the volume of the initial repeat/echo is as loud as the initial attack, and the volume of all additional echoes drops off noticeably as opposed to hearing a gradual decay in volume. As I said, for a $35 unit, it has its place in the scheme of things as long as you don't try to compare the Donner delay to a studio rack mount delay unit. Crank it up.",1
3970,still not sure about the solderless conections sounds easy but haven't had much luck with them yet,1
3971,"I own a Tascam 8-track which is an excellent product and I was expecting the same quality in this item but was disappointed.

The big problem is that it's a noisy connection for my guitars.  You can use the ""noise gate"" in Garageband to diminish the noise somewhat but it's more of a level gate than a noise gate.  After turning that on, the static was gone but notes that I wanted to sustain would suddenly stop when they hit the noise level gate.  Sounds very unnatural. When you play, you can hear the static in the background once your volume is high enough to be above the noise gate.

I had much better luck with microphones plugged into the XLR jack.  The noise level is so low that the noise gate can be set very low and didn't seem to interfere with the vocal input.  That's the only reason I'm not returning it.

The next interface I buy will be digital and use the 30-pin connector.

I thought this was a deal for $25 but that's actually pricey considering the sound quality.",1

I know rating strings is pretty subjective, as it's a matter of personal preference, and that these and EB flatwounds are like comparing apples and oranges, but wanted to leave feedback nonetheless.",1
3976,"I have used the 2"" wide cliplock straps for about 17 or 18 years (geez I'm getting old).  I am a working, gigging musician, and I have never had one fail me.  I own four basses and there are cliplocks on all of them.  I bought the 3"" wide strap to perhaps help distribute some of the weight of my bass as I play for 3 or 4 hours at a time.  Now that I'm into my 30's, the 2"" strap starts to fatigue me a bit as the night goes on.
The 3"" strap is just as well made and durable as any of the other dimarzio products I have purchased.  I expect it to last for many years.  The strap is made of the same ""seatbelt"" style material as the 2"" strap.  But while this serves the 2"" strap well, I believe it hinders the performance of the 3"".  The material is very slippery as it moves around on your shoulder.  Most of the wide straps I have ever tested had some sort of sheepskin or suede on the underside to not only cushion, but to stabilize.  This strap obviously doesn't have that, so on me, the strap edge just slides into my neck.  This doesn't happen on the 2"", I am able to find a very comfortable place for the strap to settle on my shoulder, it's just that it digs into my shoulder a bit after a long night of playing.  I have considered the notion that I just need time to adjust to the 3"" strap as I have been using the 2"" for so long, but I tried a 3"" suede strap at a local music store and there was no issue with cutting into my neck.  It sat right where I would have wanted it to sit.
I think unless you have really wide shoulders (I'm 5'11"", 175lb), this strap my be a bit annoying in terms of finding a comfortable playing position.  That's to bad, because dimarzio makes a great product.  If I continue to acquire guitars, I will continue to use cliplock straps-- just not the 3"" wide ones.",1

The coating is an excellent idea but it is actually a little too slippery for me. Feels like I am going to slide off the strings and they just don't feel great to me. Perhaps a little adjustment to the nano-coating that would provide a bit more traction might help. So in my subjective opinion these string are not for me.,1

Pros:
-sturdy build quality

Cons:
-craft foam ""pad"" at the top (which had detached before I even got the stand.  I glued it back down with some silicone sealant.)
-drastic backwards lean (not adequately shown in the pics-the stand has to be way out from the wall to be able to use it)
-strange side bar that won't stay in place

Like I said, it's a mixed bag.  If you don't need to put this near a wall, you might like it better than I did.  Fender seems intent upon making stands that lay way back and this is no exception.  I don't see the need for the lean, personally.  Most of the guitar's weight is at the bottom.  I've never had a guitar fall forward off a stand unless somebody knocked it pretty hard.

4004,"The shipping was fast. It seems to be well made. I find that to hear a clear tone, the side not with the opening needs be struck.

4005,"I bought this product as an add on to the most excellent Dunlop guitar maintenance kit.  The product itself is excellent (e.g. the lemon oil).  The problem I have is with the applicator.  You remove the cap, and there is a wick for the lemon oil.  I found you have to squeeze the bottle to get the oil to wick.  There were not instructions specifying anything special except to shake the bottle - so I assume I am working the bottle correctly.

First off, I want say, this a great system. I am currently a Bose Compact and Bose L1 Model II w/ 2 B1's owner. So, with that being said, I will say this falls in the middle of the two systems somewhere. Guessing, comparable to the Bose L1 Model S1 with a single B1. So, if you are looking into this particular Bose system, the Fender Expo would be a great alternative at a much lower price point.
It fell short for me, because I was really hoping it would stand up next to my bigger Bose system. The Fender Expo is much more portable and easier to set up, so that is a big bonus. Not to sure of the construction of how the line array mounts onto the sub bottom. Not very stable. In most cases you would think that this should not be a problem, but in my case, others in the bar or club seem to think these line array systems are a pole and always want to lean on them. So I am always on the defense. As long as you are able to keep them at of harms way, it won't be a problem.
My other fuss, is the bags or covers are extra and don't come with the package. Bose systems offer the covers and bags in the deal. For the Fender though, they are not that pricey and I have ordered some up and look forward to getting them.
As I said, set up and break was that much more of a breezes with the Fender Expo. I ran a DJ and karaoke show with it and found my sweet spots with it on adjustments. I use my Bose T1 mixer in front of it. I also have a Allen and Heath Zed10 that I put in front of it at home as well. I found the system to clip out a little sooner than what I expected, but carefully paying attention, I made sure to stay out of the red, to play it safe. The Bose has stood the test of time for me and I can't say that about this Fender Expo as of right now, but will report back later on that. I judged the bass by heading to the other side of the club. Everything projects well, but surely is not as dominant as the Bose Model II with 2 B1's.
So, I know I have mentioned the Bose a lot, but this is to only make a comparison, because many are more familiar with the Bose systems. All in all, I would recommend this Fender Expo system, and would like to purchase another in order to run one stage left and stage right. I think the system would shine in this manner.
Also want to mention I run a three piece band through these but have not yet done so with the Fender Expo. It would depend on the Venue. I now know I have a close and comparable back up to my Bose Model II system.",1

4017,It holds what it is suppose to and more.. The knob can be a little slippery when tightening and loosening.,1
4018,"I'd say this is just an average acoustic simulator ... I don't find it totally satisfying .... I don't need an acoustic sim very often so I'll keep this around for those rare times of need ... if you are looking for something that really sings, you might try other products ...",1

in comparison tests on a neo 2488 (in 24 bit recording mode) using a new mxl 67g, the stock tube was precisely the same on vocals.
I did not test on anything else. So in my humble opinion, these tubes provide no more ""warmth"" or ""presence""
for the mxl 67g using the ART Tube MP Studio Mic Preamp than the stock chinese tubes that it comes with. The upside
is that i have back up tubes if i ever need them. I didn't expect miracles. the ART Tube MP Studio Mic Preamp is a $30

4020,"Great product! Easy to use and I was able to shield my entire Jazz Bass. It would have been nice to get a little more of it though, since this was JUST enough.",1
4021,Appears to be reasonable quality for the pricing.,1
4022,Used to give this 5 stars. Downgraded to 3 stars:  On my Yamaha P-60 there is an annoying reverb when the pedal is NOT depressed. Not a polarity issue. Something has changed in the manufacturing process.,1
4023,"As far as Amazon's part of the process, they were stellar as usual. The unit came fast and cheaper than in my local Guitar Center, (in fact Guitar Center told me it would take 3-5 days to get it, it was out of stock).
Now on to the Motu Ultralite itself. The main advantage I have found with unit is the Cuemix software. This is a wonderful companion software that not only gives you latency free direct monitoring, but you can compress and/or eq the signal pre workstation software, so the signal you record into Logic, Reason or DP is processed before the fact. This is great because I cannot track with latency and I don't understand how anybody can. Also you can setup seperate mixes for several musicians tracking at once which is very nice. If you route the mix you want to seperate outputs and run those outputs to headphone amps (or just use an adaptor cable to send it directly to headphones) each musician can hear what they need to get lost in their own world.

I use the Cuemix software quite a bit for practicing in hotel rooms with my favorite drum loops. It makes the unit a great headphone mixer for practicing quietly, but moderately loud within your own headphone world. I have to say on the downside, the headphone amp is nowhere near as loud as my ipod...seems it should blow away a little ipod, but Apple once again proves why they have cornered the market...give the people what they want....Volume!!

On to the mic pre's...

Adequate for my taste. I called myself upgrading from a M-Audio Firewire 1814...but I have to say, the bass sound I got with the M-Audio was far superior and hipper for my taste. Cleaner, crisper, clearer and punchier. In this I was disappointed, but I could never depend on the M-Audio direct monitoring software no matter how much time I set aside to struggle with it. Before I changed to the Motu unit, I spent an entire afternoon trying to get M-Audios software to work...just would not happen they way they explained it would. Motu's Cuemix worked right out of the box...but I digress. The Motu convertors make my preamped. Super hyped jazz bass sound like a old school P-Bass...grainy, unfocused and sluggish sounding, so in the end, I won't be using the unit for the hotel room recordings I thought I would be, but i'll practice a lot.

Let me backtrack for a second: I initially bought the unit because I was flying back home to record some friends on a song on my latest cd and I had to have the direct monitoring thing stable and in place. Mission accomplished. Was I in love with the final sound of the recording? Eh...I used a Audio Technica 4047 S/V mic on vocals and guitar and in my home studio it sounds stellar...in the hotel room with my friends it was adequate..sounded kind of like a SM57...But I got the job done and both the singer and guitarist had their own mixes and were comfortable tracking over headphones.

In conclusion, there are great points about this unit: the construction seems sturdy and road worthy, the cue mix latency free and seperate mix software and then the not so great points: the preamps not having a hi tech sound to them mainly, no HD here folks!...and oh yeah, if they had included in the cuemix software the ability to mix the level of your host software that would have been awesome, but they didn't, so you have to go to logic or dp and mix its level, the jump back to cuemix...minor flaw. I workaround it by routing the host software to seperate outs on the Motu, then using 1/4"" TRS cables run it back into the Motu on inputs 3 & 4, then the host software shows up on cuemix. I can then get the mix jst right all on one page...

4024,Hard to keep in tune. I ordered better strings and am considering changing the tuning keys. cute little banjolin,1
4025,They say this model is too bass heavy and therefore inaccurate than their lower numbered models and it sounded pretty true for me. The bass is heavier yet trebles were also abit too sharp for my liking and the deal breaker was the fitting on the head for me. They were applying way too much pressure on the sides of my head and ear because the muff is not wide enough so they cut into somewhere middle on my ears. Returned.,1
4026,So far works ok but screen is to small to see when standing. I have to bend down every time I tune,1
4027,Good for Drum contacts and experimenting,1
4028,Granted this strap is not nylon for which I have had in the past but more like a canvas type of material. This strap looks nice and serves the purpose but is not as comfortable as I would prefer. It digs into my neck a bit. Not such a problem for short jam sessions but I could see where it may be problematic for longer sessions.,1
4029,"I assume it's not that common a problem, but the ball end on the high E string broke after about 2 weeks of relatively light playing.  I'm not hard on my strings, and I typically get 3 or 4 years out of a set.  It was a disappointment to have these break so fast.",1
4030,"ear pads are cheap thin plastic, not like the old ones. head band is also made of stiff thin plastic, unlike the old ones. theme here ?  sound is ok for voice and hearing whats going on, but again not as good as the old ones. they really do seem like $20-$30 pair, not what they are charging. all the money of went into the TA3 connectors to make the cable easy to replace.  the upside is they are light and reasonably comfortable for open ear design. not for critical use where isolation is needed like field audio recording, then the HD280's are the best price / performer hands down.",1
4031,"To clear one thing up first, there were THREE (3) picks in the package that I received, not four as stated in one of the questions. I expected four based upon that answered question, but in hindsight there are only three shown in the picture, so I guess ""what you see is what you get"" applies here.

The good:
1. The picks arrived very quickly after my order, especially considering that they traveled all the way from the UK to Idaho.
2. The quality seems to be very good; they are smooth, evenly shaped, and there are no sharp edges.
3. They seem to be very playable

The bad:
1. I don't know about the ""stainless steel"" part of the description. What I do know is that my toolbox magnet is attracted to these picks as if they were common nails. I also know that my magnet will not pick up solid stainless steel screws. I often sort fasteners this way. Perhaps these picks are plated with stainless steel. I am not a metallurgist, however, so I can make no claim regarding their true composition. I just found this to be unusual.
2. These picks are very stiff, and it takes more effort to bend and form them to the fingers than fitting a set of Dunlaps. The Tone Deaf picks come sized very small, with the wrap-around ends touching, so they must be enlarged. The problem is that when you go to open them up to fit your fingers, they are no longer round. A good pair of non-marring jewelry pliers is highly recommended to get them to the right shape for your fingers. Needle nose pliers with tape wrapped around the ends of the jaws might work too.
3. The edges of the finger wrap-arounds on my Dunlaps are flared up a bit so they don't dig in, but the edges of the Tone Deaf picks are flat. I find that the Dunlaps are more comfortable as a result. This, of course, is purely subjective.

I don't think that they are bad picks, but I probably won't buy them again. YMMV.",1
4032,"The HP550s have great sound quality and a lot of power, and at a good price. I noticed an instant improvement in my mixdowns (I produce hardstyle and hardtrance). One problem for me is that my ears are slightly too big for them, but, then again, I have big ears. The other issue is their isolation. They block out almost all sound, but occasionally you do hear something come through. I would recommend these for anyone on a budget, but if you want pure quality, spend the extra $100 for pioneer hdj-1000s.",1
4033,"These look very similar to Fender's confetti picks.  They even perform like them, except for one KEY difference.  These are much slicker than the Fender picks, and I am much more prone to losing these out of my fingers while playing.  Obviously not a huge issue, but still not great when you are playing live.  Will use them up, and then back to Fender.",1
4034,"What the kit really needs to be complete is some wood glue and some loctite.

Since the new screws are smaller, some wood glue should be applied and left to set at least 24 hours. On the lock with button, there should be loctite to make sure the nut doesn't come loose over time.

If you're gonna make sure your precious guitar doesn't hit the ground, Fender's R&D people should make a better kit.",1
4035,Its okay.kinda falls inbetween the strings alot.,1
4036,so far so good,1
4037,Bought this for my daughter to march with her freshman year of high school. She has an expensive wooden clarinet for concert band that I played years ago. There is a big difference in the sound and her band director thinks that a better mouthpiece will help with the sound. I'm sure this would be a great buy for a new student until they are sure that they want to continue playing throughout school.,1
4038,"I use it for a slight slapback effect on my bass. It performs well in that department. It has a weird pop when I turn it on and off, which is most unimpressive, and all the the settings are reset every single freaking time I plug it in. So aggravating. Other than that, it does exactly what I want and takes up minimal space on the board. There are better pedals out there but this is cheap and I ain't rich.",1
4039,"These sticks are ok.  I bought them for my middle school aged daughter.  They broke after a couple of weeks' use.  I was able to glue them back up and they are still working.  The rubber knobs were also a bit loose, so I glued them, too.
I recommend that you tape the sticks up as soon as you receive them.  You can use colored electrical tape, duct tape, first aid tape, etc.  The idea here is just to give them a bit more strength so they won't break.",1
4040,I'm rating this 3 stars as the first one sent to me was bent out of shape slightly and wouldn't close properly. Which is a pain for a so called heavy duty case. They did however send me a second one straight away .. No hassles there...and this case is great with no issues and looks pretty sturdy.. so fingers crossed! It fits my 81 strat and 72 tele very snug I feel secure carting them around in there. My only fear is that the case is succeptible to warping due to the other one being a bit out of shape,1
4041,"I bought an affinity sunburst with a maple neck used for 120. I am happy with the purchase but i do think people over emphasize the quality of this guitar. First, it looks great. the sunburst is real pretty  and professional looking and it looks solid. Its my prettiest guitar i own even though its much cheaper than my strats and les paul. The sound is good, i owned another an MIJ version and this sounds very similiar. You get that telecaster sound, especially in the mid position with new strings-its classic tele twang. For those not familiar with teles their bridge pickups are meatier than a strat and handle heavier music much better. I like tele bridge pickups, a nice compromise between single coil bite and humbucker smoothness. Tele neck pickups are tiny, but they are more mellow than a strat, don't know why but they are. sounds good to me though but don't expect that hendrix clean sound like a start bridge pickup, moe like a P-90.  The negative is the playability, the action just insnt that great and the frets are not good. my intonation is good and i can play it but it will never es easy as a ""real"" tele which are so easy o nthe hands. but i can play most anything and it stays in tune. it gives me my tele fix withough the bucks.",1
4042,"My review is 3 stars because the description stated ""Professional collapsable music stand"" and the title indicated ""deluxe"" which indicated to me this stand would be fairly rugged even at this price.  And although nice for the money, this is NOT a professional quality music stand.

This stand is very light duty, the parts are cheap and I would not put much pressure on the knobs/screws.  I was assembling the top stand and stripped the holding screw.  DO NOT use a lot of pressure when locking down the different sections and if you are going to be adjusting this frequently I would suggest looking a higher quality stand.

There are positives however as this is much better than others at this price point and fine for light duty use where you'll not be making adjustments to the stand often.  But IMO, this would not be a good stand for a school in my opinion or for a household where several different people are going to be using this often and adjusting.",1
4043,"I heard alot about these stands and finally decided to buy one after my cheapo one fell over with my bass still on it.
This is a nice looking, well designed stand and feels like it can withstand the rigors of constant use. However, the 5th time I took this to a show, I expanded it and one of the screws and nuts attaching the back leg to the support bar fell off and I never did fine the missing screw...wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night. I ended up buying some screws and fixing it (which was also a pain as the nut needs to be inserted about 6 inches down the pipe and secured so you can thread the screw into it....not an easy task. I really expected better quality for $35.00 after such light use....still love it, but not to a 5 star level.",1
4044,"It's a cheap neck. So I wasn't expecting much. First off it came in just a box and some bubble wrap. Not very secured. Once I opened it, couldn't help but notice that the fret ends were sharp. Once installed, found some high frets. Also the nut wasn't glued on very well. Last the ""strip"" that runs the back of the neck... Not flush with the rest. It would of been ok it there was too much material that could of been sanded but there wasn't enough..

With that said, keep in mind the price. It's not a high quality product. It needs work. But for the price it's a great value. Also a good neck to learn fret work on. Over all they are not bad once you put in some work into them. Remember, a finished neck can easily set you back $200+.",1

4052,My Taylor guitar came with these on it so I ordered this set to replace them. I play every weekend and cant afford in my act to break strings often. I broke 2 in one set and said I am going back to DR brand strings. They sound real good but so do the DR acoustic strings DRs hardly break and I have to change them less to. Maybe I got a bad set of Elixirs or something because others really like them.,1
4053,"Too thick to be helpful.  I would actually use them on the front bottom, if yours touches the ground, but it makes the rim very thick to hook up a pedal.  With one on each side, it's impossible. I ended up tearing the bottom one.

Ironically, I intentionally ordered  this one thinking that because it was thicker it would protect better. Shame on me.",1
4054,These seem be good enough: they are insert molded which seals everything well and they should last well. Now if you are looking for the best (i.e. 20 gauge wire and 95% shielding ect.) Look else where.,1

4063,"I like the sharp tip.  It comes in handy for certain pick scrapes over other thick picks I usually use.  I don't like where the indention is for the grip.  It's further away from the tip than I like, but obviously it's a preference thing.  I also don't like the type of plastic.  I love the Dunlop Gator pick material over this hard shiny plastic.  Again, it's just a preference thing.  Lastly, the 3mm spec is kind of pointless since where you hold it is much thinner due to the indention and the edges are a lot thinner, too.  It's completely rigid, but the 3mm part is only valid at the thickest part of the pick which isn't even used.",1
4064,"Not thrilled with the packaging, since it came in a padded envelope; I thought there should have been either a dowel rod taped to it, or cardboard tube around it to protect it more from bending or breaking in transit, but mine made it through my mailbox pretty well (envelope was bent just above the end of the tipper -- thankfully no breakage at the end.
The tipper itself is pretty good, it's an effect.  Not quite a brush sound on a bodhran, but...
I found one of the bamboo skewers (yeah, it's made out of bamboo skewers!) had NOT been cut or sanded to match the others, and the skewers are NOT glued together under the wrap tape...they can be moved around, which then moves the cut and sanded sides out of alignment, but it can be twisted and re-aligned.
Here's the bottom line... if you're lazy, go ahead and get it...just find the best deal so you don't pay more than the price of the tipper in shipping!!!

If you're not, or are very crafty you can DIY as bamboo skewers are available at Dollar Tree or dollar deals, etc... for ...well, if you have to ask....a dollar plus local tax. (there's about 25 in a package). Add glue, sandpaper and either grip tape or string if you're really crafty, and about an hour of work...
I'm not --  I did make my own, but I went ahead and bought one as well...and I use it....

These lights DO NOT have a standard receptacle AKA: NEMA 5-15p.  Luckily, MCM Electronics item # 23-887 solved my problems, but I was not happy about having to spend an additional $45. Shame on American DJ for not including these wires. All they give you is 4 regular power cords.

I look forward to the new unit arriving in a few days.  I would still recommend this unit.
Remember, the evaluation above this one is for the E-109.  Please change my review to VERY GOOD - RECOMMENDED.",1
4083,ok,1
4084,"As listed in other reviews this thing is like sitting on a rock. There is 1"" of low density foam. Reengineering the top as the frame is solid if put together correctly and all screws are tightened. I purchased 2 sheets of 1"" low density foam and 1 sheet of high density foam padding at Wal-Mart in the crafts section and as soon as I can remove the 100 plus staples on the bottom of this stool I will see what the wood / MDF looks like. From what I can gather the seat is 3"" of mdf and 1"" of foam. If this turns out to be the case I will cut a new base plate out of 3/4"" Plywood and add the foam I purchased to make a useable seat for playing my guitars.
If you don't have the skills /tools to reengineer the seat opt for a better designed seat. If you do you can make this useable with minimal effort although you shouldn't have to.",1
4085,I used these on a small Yamaha 3/4 acoustic electric travel guitar. I do like the bright tone of the strings better than the stock strings that came with it but not the feel of them. The coating is an excellent idea but it is actually a little too slippery for me. Feels like I am going to slide off the strings and they just don't feel great to me. Perhaps a little adjustment to the nano-coating that would provide a bit more traction might help. So in my subjective opinion these string are not for me.,1
4086,I like the unit but I'm having a tough time getting the blue tooth to connect to my phone. I'm guessing that my phone needs to be updated.,1
4087,This is for a PX130 and not a PX 310.  duh!  stupid mistake on my part,1
4088,"Is over priced, It is only plastic.",1
4089,"Feels cheap, but then it was cheap.  No good way to attach my Audio Technica mike.

4090,"I use equipment rated both 220 V and 110 V. I added this unit on my rack to supply power to 110-volt  rack-mounted equipment, since the rack already had a 220 V power supply. Good that I can switch on / off individual equipments. Inconvenient: the outlets are too close one to the other, so most of power supplies I plug in can take up to three outlets. Other inconvenient: I have to force the cable in the USB power outlet, and still it does not fit in perfectly.",1

4093,"Am I the only one who doesn't enjoy this microphone? It's OK and it's a little better than the internal mic for a laptop, but honestly? The sound is very minimal and sounds very far away. I've been working at this thing for the past 2 days to no avail. I bought it to try and record music playing, but the playing sounds like I'm in an echo room far away down in a rabbit hole somewhere. The sound sounds distant. It's not worth $50. I just thought it would be a little better than what it was.",1
4094,"I originally started this review with the sentence: This guitar is actually not bad for such a reasonable price for a hollow bodied archtop electric...
I bought this guitar for just over 200 at a local dealer, and when I wrote this review on Amazon, the price was 159 dollars in November of 2011. It went up to 227 just before the holiday, and now there is one seller asking $350. This guitar is NOT WORTH $350.
If the price goes down to 250 or less, then read on, this is the rest of my original review...
 Its sound is good and the craftsmanship is better than normal for such a budget guitar... I say this because please be aware that Oscar Schmidt was not always ""Washburn's little brother"" as another reviewer commented... as in fact they date back as old as the original Washburns do and to a completely separate company. Currently both brands are owned by US Music Corporation, who bought them both circa 2000 from Fretted Industries, who bought both brands from separate companies in the late 70s.
The brand is currently associated with Washburn because of the ownership. After purchasing the names US Music Corp turned Oscar Schmidt into a budget line, and also make budget Washburns that are sold at Target. Many Oscar Schmidts, depending on the dealer, often come horribly setup and are no longer the instruments they once were... there are exceptions, of course, this guitar can be a great value as long as you get it from a good dealer. The only thing they seem to make consistently good anymore is auto harps, since the brand was always very well known for that. As for Washburns, well, just don't buy one at a Target I guess.

As far as this little gem goes:
*Action: The action is good, not perfect, rises higher up but if its setup right, or you have it re setup like I did at your local guitar dealer, the action is really good.
*Sound/Tone: Both dry and out of an amp, this has a really warm tone and compared to other semi-hollows that are much more expensive, it competes really well. The first amp I played it out of wasn't even a guitar amp because at the time I recieved it my amp was at my drummer's house, so I played it out of a bass amp, and even out of that it gave a great sound (bassier obviously with some feedback) but out of good amp it sounds fantastic.
*Hardware (Pickups & electronics / tuning keys, etc / neck): A lot of reviewers said that they upgraded the pickups on this and it really made a difference, turning a 200 dollar guitar into a made-in-America quality hollow body. I think for the price the electronics are good, though, I have no problems with the keys, and the neck came straight with no need for adjustment.
*Finish: Very well crafted, pretty.

You're welcome to read my ""So you want to own an Oscar Schmidt Guitar?"" review under product review guides. Amazon always deletes the link but it will come up under that name. It details the history of both companies.",1
4095,"I've used D'Addario strings for ages playing in a rock cover band.  I was getting tired of buying and changing strings for guitars in 4 different tunings(E, Eb, Drop D, and open G) one pack at time.  Buying in bulk seemed like the way to go.  The price was good ($73 when I got them).  The problem came when I tried to pull the second low E string out and it would not budge.  All the other strings(high e, b, g, d, a) pulled out easily with no problem.  I followed the instructions on the box, pinching all other strings, holding them back while I pulled one.  The second one pulled out about three inches and would not pull any further.  I finally resorted to gripping the ball end of the string with pliers and yanking it out.  Not good for the string obviously, but it pulled out and has worked without breaking.  A testament to the quality of the strings, but also to the lack of attention they put into designing this box.",1
4096,"Just buy the key oil, use the swab you have and the brush you have.  Overkill.",1
4097,I bought a bunch of different picks to try. I bought these from the recommendation on the Justinguitar webpage. I feel these are just a little flimsy or too thin for me.,1
4098,"As with most of the Behringer stuff, the price is surprisingly low, and that's the draw. The unit's plastic construction isn't a problem for me - I don't gig. Works fine with no noted PSU noise (no hum/buzz/60Hz...) from my pedalboard power supply.

I've been fiddling with it for a few months, and it just doesn't have a sweet spot. I don't like it enough that I ever want it on.

You can get short-delay doubling, but the control the delay-time knob gives you is not fine enough to get it just right. You can max it out to full delay and it sounds not so much like a large hall as it does a cheap pedal. That and I'd like about twice the maximum delay out of this thing. C'mon, charge $5 more and make it more useful.

When I engage this thing, whatever clarity and bite I had seems to disappear - not just due to reverb muddying things up; that I expect - but the original and delayed sounds just don't seem to retain the clarity I want.

I'm assuming the insides of this pedal are something like the ""bucket-brigade line"" delay pedals that started to come out in the early 80s. This pedal reproduces the feel of those - including the not-so-great fidelity. (Happily, I can't hear clock signals, nor aliasing, so we've come a little way forward in 30 years).

I'm guessing there are not many people pining for the sound of the old Electro-Harmonix delay lines - what you're likely coming to this pedal for is one of two things: 1. a cheap, crisp digital delay - and this pedal is NOT that on either count. 2. a tape echo (like an Echoplex), but in a more convenient solid-state form. This pedal tries a little bit to be that, but it doesn't have the fine control you need to work it as you would an Echoplex, and the knobs are tiny and down on the floor.

I think I'd move along and try something else next time.",1
4099,It does the job ok.,1
4100,"These key risers do their job, that is raising the key height, but they don't do it well. They're wobbly and will twist if too much pressure is put on them, as well as tear if used a lot. For example, my D key riser is torn because I use that key so often. To me, they weren't really worth the money because I eventually took them off and got developed a better grip for hitting the unraised keys. I personally would recommend the Runyon risers over these, but I think it's better to get good at playing without risers because the metal won't cause any ripping or loose fitting issues.",1
4101,"At a jam you might not have ready access to an AC outlet so a 9volt rechargeable power supply like this might come in very handy. However if you are playing a gig with your own amp you presumably have access to AC power so you should be able to plug in a One Spot and run the cable next to the guitar cable connecting your pedalboard to your amp. Tip: bring along an AC splitter pigtail which will plug into a single outlet and power two devices. They also come in handy if your power adapter will block needed outlets on the power strip.
I have not tried this device so I gave it a neutral 3 star rating.",1
4102,"These are not bad for the price and have a good feel to them weight wise. I would say beginner sticks for sure but once you get to be a better drummer and you are learning how to make different sounds with your kit like a rim shot. These will snap off fast. It didn't take too long for my son to snap the tip off doing a rim/head hit. if these are for a electric kit, I would give these a 5 star for that perpose",1
4103,I bought this because I wanted to see what you get for such a cheap price. Well it's no crossover or Blues Band. But I was surprised at how well it plays. So far mine is holding up well. Pretty good volume too. If you want a shirt pocket harp that you don't need worry about misplacing etc. this is a good choice. a good buy for the money spent.,1
4104,Somewhat flimsy but ok for light duty application.,1
4105,"It's a low cost mic cable so there isn't a lot to say about it.  I needed a mic cable in a pinch and since I am in the process of moving, all my normal cables are packed up and I can't get to them, so I ordered this one.  It'll work, but my first impressions are that the cable is heavy and stiff.  Most of my cables are much more flexible and easier to work with, but they also cost quite a bit more - including the ones I made myself.  This one should work fine and does seem to be better quality than what I typically expect from Hosa.  I did open up one of the connectors and found that the internal wires are stranded and there is a spiral shield from the stranded ground conductor.  Note: they do list this as a 90% spiral shield so if you are in a high RF/EMI environment, and need a 100% shield, keep looking.  The connectors are made by REAN, which apparently is a division of Neutrik, so they aren't normal Neutrik connectors but they do have a lot of similarities.  At least they aren't cheap, flimsy no-name connectors that bend out of round with the slightest pressure.
I don't have much else to say.  I can't speak to longevity, but I doubt it would hold up under heavy use.  Stiffer cables never last.  But, like I said...I needed a cable in a pinch and this should work just fine.",1
4106,"For $25, this case can offer decent protection for your 12 fret guitar if you want to store it under a bed or take it on a light trip.

The padding is some sort of crinkley sounding material - will make you wonder what the hey is in there.

There is apparently only 1  back strap included with the bag, but the design would lead you to believe there should have been two.

Most importantly, I found this particular size will only fit two of my 12 fret parlors - the Jim Dandy, and the A&L Ami.  Will NOT fit my 12 fret Washburn, because the headstock area is too small, and the length is too dicey for me to  try and shoehorn my Seagull 14 fret Grand Parlor in there, though apparently some folks have.

So, if you want an inexpensive bag for a 12 fret with a small headstock like a Jim Dandy or A&L Ami, this will work, but if you own any other type of parlor guitar,  you may want to look at other options.",1
4107,nothing special,1
4108,"Nice rack once it's assembled, but it was a nightmare to put together, hence 3 stars instead of 5.",1
4109,"I'm not using it for DJ pupose so I'm trying to find a balance between it and my speakers, it's great for DJ's but I don't really believe it's a 1000 watts.",1
4110,"I bought the nickel finish, and it looks fine with the chrome hardware on my Epi Les Paul 2013 Honeyburst Plus Top Pro.

But here's the rub: The button screw on the Epi is larger in diameter than the Schaller screw, so the hole on the guitar is bigger than it should be for the Schaller screw. Ok, if you tried to screw the Schaller screw into the Epi hole, it may seem to fit, but by definition it won't be good fit.

I didn't want to fill the guitar holes with toothpicks and glue, re-drill and so forth, as it involves doing stuff to the guitar. I wanted to use the Epi screw. So I had to drill the hole in the Schaller button so that it's big enough to accommodate the Epi screw (doesn't take much drilling, very pleasant to do, in fact). Second, I used a Dremel rotary tool to file the heads of the Epi screws so that they\re small enough to go into the Schaller button.

After you do all that, the Schaller buttons screw on with the Epi screws, and everything's copacetic.

I wish Schaller would design the lock so that the hole is bigger and provide two sets of screws of varying diameters to accommodate different guitars. So I cannot give 5 stars because of all the work needed to make it really secure on my Epi Les Paul.

One final problem: My guitar strap is pretty thick (two layers of leather) at the button points, and it took a lot of trimming to dress the strap holes so that there's enough space to slip on both the washer and nut and then tighten the nut (with a wrench above and another below). After the nut started to turn, I could then use a lot of torque to tighten and squish the leather. I think Schaller should have made the  threads longer to accommodate thicker straps. Note that the wrench can scratch the shiny washer, so if it's important to you, put tape on the wrench head first).

Finally, I keep my Epi in a Gibson Les Paul case (I figure I'll one day buy a Gibson, so I might as well get a Gibson case). The case has lots of clearance for the two buttons (with the strap removed), so no worries there.",1
4111,"People typically buy cables with right angle plugs for performance- plugging straight into your guitar. This cable is only 5 feet long, meaning that it is pretty damn short for performing.

Buy a 10 ft cable for performance.",1

4118,"I bought this Gammon set to learn to play drums and just to have fun with at home.  I am in my 50's now and got into music with my first guitar at 9 years old.  I now have 5 guitars but have always wanted to play drums.  Unfortunately I am on a very limited budget so I had to go with an inexpensive set.  I agree with other reviewers that state the cymbals need to be upgraded immediately.  The ones that come with the set sounded like banging on pots and pans from my kitchen.  I got some Planet Z cymbals made by Zildjian and that improved the sound tremendously even though they are probably the cheapest thing made by Zildjian.  I'm a big guy weighing in at over 250 lbs. and the drummers throne actually bent the first day I had it.  If you are heavyset like me, get a much beefier throne right away.  I haven't replaced the heads yet mostly because I'm not that good but eventually I will be doing that.  The set does seem pretty sturdy and I can't complain about the construction except for the spindly little throne.  All in all, I think this is a good set for a beginner as long as you are prepared to start upgrading cymbals, heads, etc. right away.  You definitely will want to toss the cymbals immediately.  With my new cymbals and throne I am a happy beginner!",1
4119,This is not the same as the original Nano Kontrol. It has less features and in my experience as well as many others i searched out online the Korg software editor does not recognize this unit. However I was able to integrate it into Sonar by using the ACT software in Sonar. Some of the buttons above the transport don't seem to be usable and Korg has no software that I can find to solve this. .. Sooooo it is working in Sonar and I can use it. If I were to try this again I would buy the original unit Nano Kontrol 1.,1
4120,"This stand has a strap to hold the guitar in place and is naturally slanted by one leg of the tripod being much shorter. There is a support for the bout of the guitar you insert in the base.

I don't find this particularly stable but it's ok for keeping the guitar out instead of in the case while you practice and want the guitar standing while you are doing something that doesn't require holding the guitar (setting up a mic, etc.) There is no pad in the neck support, but the base support is coated in foam rubber.

4121,"// REVIEW //
This is a halfway decent preamp for $100 but do yourself a favor and IMMEDIATELY replace the tube in it.  It comes with some Chinese piece of junk tube that will make your lead vocal sound like my cat hissing and farting into a tin can.  Try a Sovtek 12ax7 or a JJ -- I like the Sovtek but feel free to ask the opinion of your local tone junkies.

// HOW TO SWAP THE TUBE //
1. Remove all the screws and pop the silver plates off of one or both sides
2. Pull the black metal casing off
3. Gently rock the glass tube back and forth to remove from the white thing it's plugged into.  Be sure to apply a bit of counter pressure...
4. Pop in the new tube
5. Put the casing back together.
6. Write to Presonus and politely suggest that they pony up the $12 for a better tube so that people such as myself don't give their product 3 stars instead of 4.

If you're noticing that the tube is breaking up really easily, well, you get what you pay for!  These things just don't have the voltage you'll find on higher end preamps.  I usually find that putting the Drive knob (which controls the tube) at about 9 o'clock and the Gain knob at 1 o'clock gives me good volume and a touch of tube warmth without distortion or hiss.  I'm using this thing with an AT4040 and I'm pretty happy with the results considering that I've heard the same mic through much more expensive preamps before...",1
4122,I ordered this kit for a Squier Se. (The SE came in a strat pack with amp and accessories)  The pickup covers are too shallow and allowed the pole pieces to stick way out.  The p-up selector tip was too loose on the switch and kept falling off. I put a bit of tape on the switch to keep the tip on.  The rear control cavity plate is way off and dosen't fit. The only thing that fit properly was the control knobs and the tip of the trem bar. Just be careful before you order.  I ended up switching back to the original parts.,1
4123,I have hard time mounting it on a mic stand. It seems a little lose. I can't trust it to keep a microphone or other electronic items on it.,1
4124,Works well but for some reason the 3.5mm mic jack is really quiet compared to the XLR. I have to crank everything up to max to hear anything from it.,1
4125,hate the fact that you have to tie the thing on. it should come with hooks to easily take on and off.,1
4126,they store a few picks. it works,1
4127,Aside from the low e this is very accurate. If it worked on all strings I would give it 5 stars.  It is unobtrusive and accurate but  about half the time the unit doesn't respond to the low e,1
4128,"I'd  give it 3 1/2 stars, if I could. I've had it one day. I have found no tears or broken stitching, so far. The zipper took a few openings and closings to run smoothly. I expected a little thicker padding to protect the neck and around the sides. The front pocket is deep enough to store tuners and other small items like capos. The padding behind the pocket does seem to offer good protection for the sound hole, saddle and bridge so, I guess for less than $20 it's pretty good.",1

4141,"These headphones are great in terms of bass kick, comfort, build quality, and sound stage and highs. The only issue with them is the mids are quite recessed. I've heard this improves a bit after they are burned in however in my experience, they always still have recessed mids, which is most noticeable in the vocals.

For almost as good bass but better over all frequency response, I would recommend you look into these two Denons as an alternative both are also closed type headphones:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Denon-AH-D5000-Reference-Headphones/dp/B000MVEC10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Denon AH-D5000 Reference Headphones</a>

Both have a flatter (better) frequency response and will sound better over all although they do have a different styling.

I hope this helps. I went through this comparison process myself and this is the conclusion I came to. I settled on the Denon D7000s and while they still have great bass, the mids and highs are also great. The bass on them is slightly less than with these Ultrasones but overall the sound is more enjoyable to me since the frequency response is more realistic to me.

Make no mistake, the Ultrasone 900s really kick hard and are quite enjoyable to listen to. But the sound is as if you have a subwoofer on with the gain way up and the vocalists are singing at you from behind a curtain. This is quite unfortunate because I really like everything else about these headphones and even prefer the design of them over the Denons.",1

Anyway....pedal is really good at giving that nice clean boost. Pedal does what it should at a fraction of the cost. The pedal is solid and has a nice metal case. Here is my one gripe...I have to unscrew 4 screws to put a 9v in. Not good in a gig situation if I need to change it quickly. Also, the battery compartment is not separate from the board.

4148,"I have exclusively played Suzuki's since I was about 13. My first harp was the Promaster & I loved the weight & the sound.
Just last year I discovered the Valved Promaster which seems to project better sound giving you more room to bend the notes. One problem with valved Promasters is they all seemed to need to be broken in before you could get the full sound out of the harps.
The SUZUKI MANJI is the best ""play right out of the box harp"". You get the great sound & ability to bend notes like the valved promaster without the dead notes or having to break it in much. It does have one ""dead note"" Since I got it the 3 hole is a little tough to blow through.

Bottom line is I really like this harp but it's not perfect. I want to keep experimenting & maybe try some HOHNER/Lee Oscars...
If your looking for professional sound this is a great harp. If your not used to nice harmonicas you will be blown away & amazed at how good you can sound playing a nice one compared to a lower grade or toy-store harp.

Over all the bag is not bad it is a little bit longer then my keyboard but the security straps inside hold the keyboard in tight.  I think that this bag is really worth $30 and not $59.  They need to bring down the price on this then it will sell much faster because that is all that it is really worth.  I felt as if I paid too much for it.,1

4152,"I can't tell that it does that much. Your instrument will need to still sound pretty good out of the jack, this won't make a bad instrument sound good.

4153,"This increases noise such as hum and hiss considerably, even at moderate compression levels. If used sparingly it can help give a bit of a clean boost to your signal, but for distortion or heavy compression I don't recommend it, as it will  introduce so much noise that it is not usable",1

4156,"When I'm bored, I like to play a lot of the so-called ""cowboy chords"" and kind of strum along to music. I've experimented with a few different picks and styles of guitars (acoustic, hollow body, and electric). These days, my go-to strumming guitar is my Gretsch hollow body. Anyhow, I wanted something that had didn't add too much of that scraping sound when strumming.

I thought that I wanted some thin picks for that purpose, and actually that probably wasn't wrong, but 0.38m is a little too thin. I gave one to my friend as a joke, and he tore the pick in half with almost no effort. 0.38mm is also a little thin to be playing notes/solos. However, I do like the shape of these picks and they do feel really good. At some point, I am going to buy some that are thicker because they are a nice fill-in item for an Amazon order, and let's face it, who out there isn't constantly losing picks.",1

The DMX ports seem tighter than they should be. I had to use lots of force and wiggle the cables into place.

This is a awesome bulk pack ...  here is why ...
You've got a VERY NICE carrying bag, three cable and tree stand.
The Mic Cable are in pretty shape, fair quality!! and a good lenght. BUT (yes there's a ""but""...) the quality of the stand is ""amateur"" .  If you want a stand to be fold and unfold every day (as for a sound company) or even a week-end musician...  you will be disapointed by the stand themself. If you want to use this stand in a ""stable"" environnement it will work very good.  Per exemple, you want to mic a ""in house"" drum kit in a studio and keep it there for a while.  Wow... it Worth every penny.  But don't overrated this product with 5 star ""wow amazing"" etc... ...  it's NOT amazing but it still one of the best deal in amazon's musical store.",1

4167,"This guitar was purchased at a local store near me. I fell in love with the looks and the build, very nice construction and action was decent, strings were a bit rusted but I usually change strings on every guitar I buy so no big deal there so took it home. After a setup and new strings, I played it for a few days but the honeymoon ended fast, yes it's very comfy and looks awesome but when it comes to its sound, it just left me empty.
The S34C sounded flat and dull compared with other budget guitars in the same price range that I own especially the Yamaha guitars, even the Jasmine S35 runs circles around it.
This is not the worst guitar I've heard but when there's others that just sound so much better for the same price, why bother?",1
4168,I am a little so-so on this stand. It works fine but it isn't as sturdy as I was hoping. I still use it so I didn't feel that it was return or replace worthy but it didn't blow me away.,1

4170,"I had this amp for approximately a year. The  features are great. The power soak and recording out were great to have. Even the cool blue lights were a plus. However, like a lot of other ex tubemeister users, I couldn't get the sound out of it that I needed. I thought the cleans were very hard and the overdrive kind of buzzy. It has a hi fi kind of sound which seems to backup many opinions out there on this amp. I could not try before I bought it because no local shop had hughes and kettners. The amp also got extremely hot. It will get very hot, hotter than any of my other tube amps but it did not affect the amps durability or functions. It has lots of features and alot of people love them but I just did not think it did one thing very well. All in all, it has all the bells and whistles you may need so i gave it thrre stars. I just didn't like the sound but thats a personal preference. Try before you buy if possible but maybe it will be your style if you decide to pull the trigger.",1
4171,"Be warned: Do not buy this as a first uke or starter instrument.

It's not bad for what it is - a cheap plastic uke.  The strings that come on it are junk and need immediate replacement.  Once that is done, you have a plastic uke that actually can be  used to make some music.  However, the action is way too high.  It makes it hard to play, and it is very easy to bend the strings out of tune.  The bridge is one solid piece so there is no way to adjust the action.

If you are a uke player and looking for a novelty that you can play in the shower then you might like it.  This Woodi is also way better than the plastic so-called Outdoor Uke which is $200 and truly terrible.  However, don't make the mistake of thinking this is a good uke to buy for a child or a beginner.  There are many ukes by Ohana and Kala that are cheaper and better.  The Makala Dolphin is cheaper, also has a plastic body, and comes in a lot of colors.  The Dolphin allows for adjusting the action, and and the Dolphin sounds a whole lot better.

So why do I even give this three stars.  Well it looks good overall.  And it can be played as a ukulele, although not a particularly good one.  Uke players seem to have certain fascination with plastic ukes, and as plastic ukes go you could do worse.",1

I returned it.",1
4179,I really liked this board a lot and wanted to use it but I sent it back because the bag that comes with it would last about 2 weeks before I predicted it would start falling apart and the reason I was looking for a new board in the 1st place was because I was tired or fixing the bag for my previous board of similar design. I tried the SKB SC2316 case for it and that bag would be really nice and good quality but with it the overall package was just too large and heavy to carry around for 5 or 6 pedals.,1

Even though this pick comes up while searching for mandolin picks- it works, it just dulls the sound.",1
4184,These are very good reeds. The problem is I did not read the strength close enough. A Medium-hard is too hard for me. Other then my error these are the quality that I remember from my high school days and I would recommend the brand to anyone; just pay close attention to the strength.,1

4188,"The Joyo ""American Sound"" is supposed to immulate the sound of a 57 twin reverb (or something of the like), and I'm sure it does, under very specific circumstances.

I am running the pedal through my orange micro-terror in hopes to get that true American sound through my British tube amp. Instead, I am getting an INSANE amount of hissing and screeching.

After playing with the amp and pedal settings, I learned if you are going to use this pedal with an amp, the only useable amp setting is ""volume"". If I use the amp's ""tone"" or ""gain"" settings, the hissing and screeching comes in full force. So you are at the full mercy of the pedal if you decide to use it.

Secondly, if I have a 9v power source plugged into the pedal, rather than a 9v battery, the hissing and screeching is present. Granted, by power source is a little beaten up - but it works with my other pedals.

In short, I have no freedom to adjust settings between the pedal and amp for sound engineering, and I must rely on a 9v battery for power. The only reason I don't comepletely trash the pedal is because even though it requires very specific settings to get a decent sound, once I found it, it really does capture that classic fender sound. It's just a headache to find it.",1
4189,"Not bad but not great either, I researched a lot on the Internet and all the videos on YouTube sounded great. But when I got mine it just didn't measure up.

4192,"I've had this for some months now and it seems to work just fine.  The sound is decent and it tracks discs well.  I like the mechanism for putting in a CD, it's a slot like I have in my car rather than a tray that pops out.  But the controls get on my nerves.  To skip to the next track you have to dial in the number of the next track and enter it or hit the button with the number of the next track--nothing like a simple ""skip"" button on the face of the player, though there is on the remote.  You can't eject a disc until you've first hit ""stop"" and given it time to digest that command.  If you're searching for something toward of the end of a track, you can't back into it by skipping to the next track and then hitting reverse, you have to go to the beginning of the track and hold the advance button through the whole track.  That's a pain if the track is more than a couple of minutes long.  I've never had a CD player that operated this way before.  Why Marantz does it this way, I'll never know. These seemed like minor points when I first got the unit, but they've started to get more noticeable.  On the whole it's a good unit, but the controls seem less than user-friendly.",1

4198,For the price it works and that's all you can ask for. 20-25ft out it can cut out. It's extremly loud so I suggest having the volume knobs at about 70% any louder and the mic will pick up your handling of the mic. i.e. from your hands and  fingers handing the mic will be picked up my the mic.,1

4201,Be prepared to drill new holes to line up the pickguard. Single coil neck pickup is supposed to be 5k but mine reads a smokin' 13k. That alone made it worth the price.

Bridge is a fairly hot 15k ceramic that I found a bit harsh for my tastes and for the moment I have a paf 8k in its place. Mini pots and switch are generic but work just fine. The search for perfect tone goes on. You may as well have fun along the way.,1

There are ways to try to program it to even out, but it is time consuming. If you have plenty of time to fool with it, it is a great device, and very economical, considering the 100 different sounds, and all tweakable. But if you are looking for something to stomp through to different effects set up before your amp, with each step emitting at wildly different volumes, be prepared for your neighbors to come over and kill you.  Or if you use headphones, to unexpectedly kill your self from a sudden blast of uber metal ear slicing stabbed through your ear drums by pressing the wrong button.",1

Maybe get the next step up, the custom or American stage series cables to get rid of the problem but they will cost you more.",1

4224,"Instant review. I plugged it in half an hour ago.

I was originally an M-Audio Keystation 32 user, with the old model, and used it until it literally broke to pieces. It was out of production for a while, and in that time I've had the old MPK mini and basically every small Akai Mini controller - the pad-only and keys-only too. This is the best of Akai's mini controllers for sure.

GOOD: The key velocity feels a lot more solid, the pads feel better, has a sustain input, and it looks like the editing software has improved.

BAD: The joystick is pretty fun, and is what sold me on this over the newly released & updated M-Audio Mini 32. But it's hard plastic, and it makes a really loud click against the edge of the joystick circle - even without force - when pushing it to one edge or another for pitch bends and modulation. Also, since it's limited to a circle, you can't do a full pitchbend up and do full modulation at the same time. It just can't reach that corner of an XY. I can see it in my VST's. Pitch up, as soon as i try to push the modulation on that bent note, the pitch wheel starts moving back down.

Can't say I'd recommend this over the Mini 32. Especially as I haven't tried the updated model (though it's low profile and looks pretty). I just use these mini controllers to rip tiny keyboard solos without leaving the desk. And with this, it's nice to have slow control over the bends, rather than a simple soft button as the M-Audio has. I don't know. Mixed feelings. Not sure if i'm playing on one better than the other.",1

4226,"The lights I received work with the exception of addressing for DMX.  I set the switches to what should be the addresses I want, but they do not address correctly.  I ended up trial & erroring to find out where there were within the 192 channels I could play with.  Once I found their location (and believe me they did not match the switch settings), I just left them at that address since I could not reliably move them to other channels.  When I did find them, all 5 DMX channels worked as advertised, Strobe (w/fade), Mstr Fade, Red, Green, Blue.  The lights are not as bright as a PAR 38, and they provide a narrow to medium beam.  I would say about 45-50 degrees.  They would make nice uplighting, although the auto settings (the whole mic sensitivity, and flashing through colors everyone has already mentioned) are fairly limited.  They are however, cheap as heck, but without proper addressing it makes it tough to use them in a DMX universe.
By the way, there are about a dozen different versions/manfacturers of these things, so other variants might work better.",1

But the strings that come on it are horrible. Buy new strings for this when you purchase it. I did not heed the warning on this. Soon seeing the error of my ways I purchased new strings and it sounds a lot better. It is easy to play and sounds like a ukulele plugged into a amp.

4246,"These are okay, came all jammed together in a bag and the colors bled between a few. Tight fit on a big grill like an SM58, tore one putting it on. Cheap though, so you can afford to buy extras. Sure was nice to be able to color code an eight mic system. Sound was good.",1
4247,"I bought a set of these simply because I hadn't tried them before. I was running low on spare strings, so I figured it might not be a bad idea to experiment a bit.

These strings have a very crisp sound, but the ring seems to fade very quickly and perhaps drop in tone a bit. An issue I haven't had on this guitar yet, and wasn't replicated on later strings.

Also worth noting that these strings were very durable, outlasting all but DR's, though they didn't maintain that ""new string sound"" half as long as DR's.",1
4248,"I am not used to them they actually slowed me down a little. They are thick picks no knife edge at the tip. I am pretty sure when I am used to them I will shred with them. The tone is very bright. Pinch harmonic are so easy!!!
J.P. knows what he is doing I am sure I just need more time using them.",1
4249,"A bit disappointed in this.  It is too long to fit in my Carvin SC90, which is the whole point in me purchasing it.  Other than that, it works fine, if it will fit in the guitar you're working on.",1
4250,"I bought one of these nearly 8 years ago. Now I really wanted to learn how to play. This was not one of those ""maybe"" kind of purchases for me. I give lessons now. I know a thing or two.

 If you're getting this because you're not sure if you, or the person you're gifting this to, really has the interest then by all means get one. However, plan on replacing it fast. It's cheap for a reason and it feels cheap. With guitars, you get what you for up to a certain price point. This is an OK starter guitar for someone who may not have the drive or patience.

If you're looking at this as a first guitar and you plan on playing, learning, practicing then pass on this. Epiphone makes great guitars and for double the price you get a much better feeling and sounding instrument. I've played on more than of these and a common issue is staying in tune and not sounding right in anyrhing but standard tuning. For examoleexample, if you want to learn metal this guitar will not satisfy you.

 The epiphone les paul standard, typically around $300 is where you should go. They fret easier and sound richer. You may also want to check out a fender telecaster modern player around the same price. It's a different feel due to the maple fretboard and really is fantastic for chords - where all beginners should start anyway.

I've gone through a number of guitars since I bought one of these. The lesson learned is when you get to the $300 - $500 you'll get quality not only in build but in comfort and tone.

I love epiphone, but depending on your level of interest in the guitar this particular model may be something to pass on. Go put your hands on one of these at guitar center and then compare to a slightly more expensive lp standard. There's a difference and it does matter. Try various models and pick the one that fits your hands, your body, and whispers ""buy me"". Craigslist is full of blind buys for a reason.",1
4251,"These are OK....I have a lot of guitar wall hangers where the yoke actually swivels very easily. These do not swing easily like my others. I do NOT like that. Otherwise, they look pretty good and they do hang guitars. So I can't complain too much, but if I knew beforehand that they did not swivel easily like every other guitar hanger I have ever seen, I would have bought a different brand. They are actually stiff enough that if, for example, I hang a Tele where a Les Paul was, I actually have to manually straighten the guitar because unlike every other hanger I have ever used, gravity is not enough to let the guitar hang perfectly straight by itself.",1
4252,"Inexpensive product. It works.  It's a really tight fit for my Rode NT2-A. Sometimes it will lose grip and let the microphone sag downward. Not ideal, and I can't imagine my mic is over 3kg. Hopefully it will hold up.",1
4253,it had too much buzz. too light all the way,1
4254,"Initially seemed ok, but not great quality... Until a friend sat on it, and it bent. Now its useless.

Update: Ohuhu agreed to replace my bench. I haven't had much chance to use it to know how that will turn out, but they have made a good effort to make things right",1
4255,"Unlike the other Planet Waves strap I order that was labeled ""leather"" but was in fact, vinyl.  This one is leather.  Hard, dry, leather.  After some conditioning it's ok.",1
4256,very nice,1
4257,"Not durable strings. Literally 2 hours of playing wears them out. However, they sound really rich before then...  ""Elixir guitar strings"" needs to make some of these. Then they would last.",1
4258,"Loved the price point of these, and they sounded great at first, but after a couple of gigs, they sounded dead.",1
4259,So so,1
4260,"I wasn't expecting the fit with my Audio-Technica ATR2500 to be so very, VERY tight...
I almost couldn't get it to fit and was a bit scared I'd damage it.
I finally got it to fit into place very carefully and got it adjusted to a good position... only to realize that because the Pop Filter wasn't adjustable, I couldn't have the buttons and monitor port in an easily accessible place and still have the mic facing the pop filter properly.
So I can't use my monitor port at all, since it's being covered by the mount's grip.
And I feel like I can never adjust it, because I may not get it back into place, ever again.

Overall, it does it's job, but is just a BIT awkwardly designed for this sort of mic.
I suppose it could be my fault for not checking close enough, but I think I may be able to get it in a workable position with enough effort anyways.",1
4261,"This is handy for camcorder. It is really helpful to have the cold shoe adapter. Sadly, however, the lapel might broke within 5 minutes of the first use. I had it clipped on the the inside of her blouse.",1
4262,"Cheaply made, vague assambly instructions but works in the end.",1
4263,"I like this mount, but the screw that attaches the mic to the mount was made poorly.  It only screws in about one full turn before getting stuck.  I contacted Blue, and they suggested that I exchange it with amazon, but also implied that they were aware of this issue.  I already paid for rush shipping on the mount, so I was not willing to go through the hassle to pack up this huge mount, do ll the paperwork to send it back, and hope that my replacement would not have the same problem. Blue said they did not have a replacement screw available, but I asked them to update when they do. Hopefully that will pan out.

Other than that, the mount is nice. Huge, but nice. As others have said, the cords on the mount are too short but I just unhooked half of them and it works much better.",1
4264,decent buttons... but just didn't work very well as a replacement on Grover tuners on my LP.  Item as described and fast shipping,1
4265,i use these mics when I have clients who want to MC at gigs. sometimes it fades in and out but otherwise they're ok.,1
4266,"Only certain cartridges fit in this case,other than that it's a sturdy case.",1
4267,These fit pretty well in the guitar case but I do find that it is tedious to have to refill it as often as I do.  Will probably look for some other options for humidifiers.,1
4268,"I was dissapointed in the packageing more than anything. Instead of being three complete & separate sets of strings they were slopped together in multiple individual 2 strings here, two there without much rhyme or reason. ... once I saw that I haven't even changed the old strings out. The strings may be great but are, in my opinion,  very poorly packaged. I will not buy them again.",1
4269,"Revised rating 10-03-2016 - Down to 3 stars from 4 stars. Reasons:
1. I eventually had to clip off one of the side clips that hold it in place because it was just too difficult to get it on and off without scratching the wood around the sound hole. My guitar suffered a few new scratches in the meantime.
2. Even before I made it easier to get in and out, the pickup did not stay in place reliably, which caused variations in the sound and occasional to frequent noises from vibrations.
3. Although it is reported to be a magnetic induction transducer, I found that although it doesn't pick up acoustic sound waves from a nylon strung ukulele, it could produce sounds from vibrations when placed against the wood itself. This leads me to thnk that it might be a combinattion of a magnetic transducer. and a piezo-electric device.
For these reasons I knocked a star off the original assessment. The quality is so-so and the sound is at best inconsistent. I have gone back to using the Deaan Markley pickup since it fits nicely, doesn't scratch the woodwork, and produces a consistent sound.

Original review:
At under $13 USD, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neewer-12-Hole-Sound-Pickup-Acoustic-Electric-Transducer-Microphone-Wire-Amplifier-Speaker-for-Acoustic-Guitar-Good/dp/B00ADHKKZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neewer 12 Hole Sound Pickup Acoustic/Electric Transducer Microphone Wire Amplifier Speaker for Acoustic Guitar Good</a>&nbsp;seemed like a good deal. I have been using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dean-Markley-DM3011-ProMag-Plus-XM-Acoustic-Guitar-Pickup/dp/B0037FR4HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dean Markley DM3011 ProMag Plus XM Acoustic Guitar Pickup</a>&nbsp;for many years and thought that perhaps with the passage of time, the technology might have improved.

First, the Neewer pickup is very hot, and picks up sound very well without having to push up the gain on the signal at all. This gave me a very funky tone on the E, A and D strings. However, I found that due to the wire cable coming out from under the casing, the high end of the pickup was slightly elevated and made contact with the strings - E especially - and provided at best a rattle, and at worst, a pinched,extra-scalar tink of a sound.

So, I had to bend the flange that holds the pickup to the edge of the soundhole a bit up so that the top surface of the pickup would move down and allow the strings to clear the metal. Not perfect, but better, and I will probably continue to adjust it rather than go through the hassle of sending it back.

The product was shipped in a padded envelope, inside a thin pasteboard boox, which was torn . Whether this had any bearing on why the product was bent, I can not say with certainty. Certainly, unless they improve their mailing package materials, or the box in which the product is sold, it seems that it will be susceptible to damage.

Would I recommend this? Yes, with qualifications as noted above. Seems to be a decent value at the price.",1
4270,"Good beginner instrument.  Sounds a little thin, but for kids who are just starting out, this is great first ukulele.",1
4271,"this is a cheaper brand~ for studio ok~
performance i would buy a better quality one!",1
4272,"Definitely not Nuetric, Amphenol or Switchcraft quality - inconsistent size differences between connectors causing difficulty with some equipment and other manufactured cables.

Insulators melt fairly easily so you have to be quick when soldering connections..

 Would not use for items that have to be connected and disconnected repeatedly however I would use for permanent installations where the connections are rarely changed.",1
4273,Overpriced pine tar.,1
4274,I didn't like this pedal. Not for me. Thats not to say it wouldnt work well for you. Its just that my amps distortion and boost channels provide much better tone than this pedal.,1
4275,"I've been playing music for about three years now, I got this guitar because it was ten bucks and I wanted something that looked pretty, read the reviews and had some scary horror stories, I ordered a green Cutaway, but it was busted in shipping, so I changed it to red, it came, the case looks like a plastic bag, but for the price it will keep it dry? My pitch pipe actually wasn't tuned properly, so I threw it away, came with extra strings (WEWT) and a strap (DOUBLE WEWT) and some picks (TRIPLE WEWT)  I didn't get a book, but I didn't want one anyways. It is a cheaply made guitar, but for what you get you can't complain, however if you plan on learning guitar I would not recommend, because the action (distance from strings to the neck) Is honestly ridiculous. Oh yeah and the bag opens from the bottom, and you kind of just have to ram the guitar into it, not the best design. I digress, if you want something that looks pretty and you can hang on your wall. For ten bucks, where can you go wrong? And if you decide to tune it and strum on it....Well it will play for the most part, but it won't sound the best.  The neck is HUGE by the way, like I'm holding an oak, granted I'm used to slender necked instruments. I will admit though, after a while of playing this guitar, I actually grew attached to it, I would buy another one.  I'll keep an eye out for the next time they are on sale, between the strings the strap and the picks, I don't mind getting a free decorative guitar =P
Oh the picks are triple pointed. So they feel weird if you're not used to them, but they have the most use out of em, they are also about a medium-heavy pick. Not my personal favorite but still. Anyways I hope this review helped if you have any questions feel free to ask.
OH before I forget yes, it did smell like a chemical the first day or so, when they go on sale I will see if the natural wood one has the same smell it could be the factory or the fact that it gets painted as soon as it is ordered. Who knows.",1
4276,These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit.,1
4277,I bit through mine right away. :/,1
4278,"Overall, the product is ok and definitely improved the sound of both my nylon string and acoustic electric guitars. However, I was not too happy to find that the box introduces some unwanted compression, specially noticeable with the nylon string Yamaha. So, still searching for a better preamp.",1
4279,works great,1
4280,"I received my order in 7 days. The guitar was double boxed and no damage occurred. The product specifications state that both the back and sides are made of mahogany which was the main reason for this purchase. It also stated that
the finish is a natural gloss. Both the back and sides are made from a very bland type of wood (not mahogany) and the stain hides  most of its detail. Also the fingerboard is described as being made of rosewood (a beautiful hardwood). Its not even made of wood, It appears to be made of ABS plastic which is just fine for sewer pipes but not to sure if its ok for the fingerboard. The following is a better description of some details.

There is no truss rod (a lot of classical guitars don't have one). The fingerboard appears reasonably straight with no bulge at the neck to body joint. (some cheap guitars have this and causes string buzz).
The fingerboard's width is: 2.00 inches (at nut) and 2.50 inches at the sound hole.
I measured string 6 clearance: fret 1 is 1.6mm. fret 12 is 4.0mm.

I plan on keeping the guitar. It appears to be well built. Looking into the sound hole reveals good workmanship. This is a nice guitar and would be even better if it was as described.",1
4281,"I really gotta say it : its OKAY.
C'mon, the best position to attach them isn't useful because they will be at the pressure point when you put your guitar on wall hangers. Expected more. Gave my old one to my girlfriend, and i KIND of miss it.
Anyway, your call.",1
4282,Just doesn't provide the sound I'm looking for.,1
4283,"ok, didn't like the sound they put out as other brands",1
4284,"Decent enough to add to your guitar as reference markers. They sit low and you cannot feel them under your fingers. Installs easily and holds firm. I put them on my classical guitar. They look ok and at quick glance you can not tell they are stick ons. They will do the job.
T",1
4285,"The finish on the capo is very poor.  It is cheap but if you wanted a quick capo that you could use playing out that no ok knee would ever steal, I think this would work great.  Very poor finish.  Other than that, works fine.  I would not buy another of these.",1
4286,This arm is good to have as a backup or a beginner's piece. But the nuts are likely to loosen overtime. WARNING: You can tighten this too tight and damage your table. Be very careful how tight you tighten this thing up. And try not to put too heavy of mics on this. They will not be super-supported on this.,1
4287,"There is no doubt that this amp has an incredible amount of volume from a micro tiny enclosure.  However, the 12AX7 doesn't contribute that much to the overall sound.  I bought this to get a good apartment-level amp, but the tone is at the higher end of the Pre and Master Volume knob.  I figured that I could get a nice round tube tone at lower volumes; that's not the case.  All the reviews and YouTube videos had a really nice clean tone and crunch tone. You just won't get those tone in a small room.
Well, the 8"" speaker and small size would mean that it is super efficient and perfect for an apartment.  It is super efficient and the low gain tones sound transistor-y.  The preamp tube has to have a little juice to get those nice tones... then the neighbors are knocking on the door.
The advertising shows the amp next to an iPhone, so ""normal"" reasoning would think that this isn't a real screamer.  It's a screamer!!  I wouldn't recommend for apartment dwellers or for your kid jamming in the bedroom.  That would be akin to buying him a drum kit.
I don't mean to disrespect the Micro Terror, it can get good tones.  My take is that the advertising makes it seem that it is a great bedroom amp and great tones at low volume.  Cranked up, it rocks.  At bedroom levels, it sounds like a tranny amp, nice clean tones that don't have that bloom of tubes.
It's a very nice amp, but just don't ya be thinking it's a small and cute amp that gets great tones at reasonable levels.  This amp will do a coffee house or small bar with ease.... without a mic.",1
4288,"I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different ""gel"" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well.",1
4289,"I could've given this product 4 out of 5 stars.  Never mind the unit having no ON/OFF Switch.  Never mind the overly Bright LEDs.  I can put up with those annoyances knowing how good this Behringer 1202FX mixer is.
But I am bothered by the fact that Amazon shipped out this item to me with a 110-volt Power Adaptor.  I had this item internationally shipped out to me here in the Philippines through Priority Courier.  One would think that Amazon had the sense to package my order with the proper 220-volt Power Adaptor for my country.  Afterall no mention was made in the item specification and description in the Amazon  ad about this item being 110 volts.  A quick check at Behringer's site mentioned having available power adaptors for every country or region. From 100 Volts to 240 volts. 50Hz or 60Hz.

It would have been better if Amazon considered adding a Special Instruction Box to be filled in by their Customers during Order Processing.  I could've emphasized that I wanted 220-volts only that way.

Nevertheless, I had no choice but to put up with a separate external Line Voltage Transformer for this product.",1
4290,....confusing to use if a Luther tries to  operate it (and we all know how dumb those people can be). I put a set on a guitar and it has a habit of cutting the string just a hair too short.  They look nice and stay in tune fine but mine that I bought in 2001 had that cutting the strings too short.,1
4291,"Great reverb, but for the price I would go for the Digitech Polara reverberation.... Just sounds way more modern and musical... This reverb has plenty of options but they are all somewhat standard.... The polara sounds insanely huge and modern.... Save a few bucks and go with digitech for this one",1
4292,"Son said, it is okay. His friend's tuner works better.",1
4293,kind of thin.,1
4294,Got these pickups a while ago. They're ok for replacement ones but I wouldn't consider them an upgrade because they don't sound super amazing. They're definitely good pickups for a guitar that previously had none but not for a Gibson or even an Epiphone for that matter that you'd want to replace the pickups for.,1
4295,"D'Addario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried, I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinky's But Found That These Last Longer, The Ernie's Bend and Play Well But They Tend To  Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernie's Start Corroding Within A Week, These D'Addario Strings Stay Brighter Longer, I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks, The Ernie's Only Last Me A Week, 2 Weeks At The Most, That Can Get Expensive Fast, All Around The D'Addario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me, Retraction, when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best, Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings, but they are no longer my preference, A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these D'Addarios. DR's last three times as long as D'Addario. the DR's cost a lil more but they are way better, for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings",1
4296,"I have a couple of these, one for the six string and one for the 12.  The six works ok, but the 12 is not so hot.  For the money you can buy a couple of Shubs and get better performance.  I started out with the G7th, but found that I preferred the Shub for both convenience and performance.",1
4297,"This is a quality case. I have a Lefty PT and to get a perfect Tele case to fit would have cost about $60 more and all I did to make this a tight fit was put a 4x5 foam block in front of the cutaway.  It was pretty secure anyway as the neck fits tight when the case is closed.
Cons: the center locking latch lifts easy too easy, the other two are fine, so not a deal killer, but a little irritating.
The open storage is nice, but the lack of flip lids means you need to lay the case flat or whatever you store is likely to come out.
Finally, you would think Schecter would have a fitted case for all models, lefty or righty, but hey still pretty good stuff and better than a gigbag for protection from water, beer etc.",1
4298,"Works fine, but smells like gasoline. Washed it and that made it less stinky.  Still works okay.",1
4299,"does its job.  It is a cheap kit, and here you pretty much get what you pay for.  The mutes seem harder than most, and don't dampen as well as others I have used in the past.",1
4300,"I bought this because I've had a TS9 before and felt it just didn't have that punch and bass warmth so I looked into this model because it has the other modes. But the funny thing is out of all of the modes I use the TS9 setting the most! Turbo mode is all boomy and farty bass with less grit and distortion, Hot is just louder with less distortion, The + mode is only slightly better for a little bit more grit but loses distortion and sounds a bit hollow. From what I understand its because of this extra low end that bass players favor this pedal. If you are shopping for an overdrive with a bit more grit and low end I would go with the Blues Driver or OCD. If you're looking for a Tubescreamer get the TS9, 808 or a Sparkle Drive. Skip this model unless the sound of farty broken speakers is your thing... or you're a bass player.",1
4301,"For the price, it's adequate, but has bad distortion at high volumes. If you're just looking for a BIT of amplification though, like 1/2 gym size, it works fine.",1
4302,"I wanted to like this more than I actually do. It's not loud enough (even if you have the volume up at its highest) if you are using it for practicing banjo rolls. You end up having to play very softly to hear the metronome. I suppose I could attach it (via the headphone jack) to a speaker, but that kind of defeats its portability. I'll use my Cherub and sigh and use this when I absolutely have to, but do be aware of its volume limitations. Otherwise it's a very trick little unit. Maybe I'll grow to like it better. Who knows?",1
4303,"For the price, I can't complain . . .  I did sever sound/comparison videos with this model.  This is a link were I do a sound/comparison test between the xm 1800s and the xm 8500

4304,"I'll start by saying I'm a guitar player, not a drummer. I wanted to get a small percussion device for adding drum tracks in GarageBand (Carl, the grundge drummer fro Seattle, doesn't always show up). I have been drumming on my knees, desktops, dashboards, and even conga type drums for most of my life, so rhythm is not a problem. I thought I'd try the Alesis to add a little hand or stick drumming. It's relatively easy to use, though it could be more intuitive.

I tried all the different sounds with both hands and sticks and will just say it was not what I was looking for. Even at its most sensitive position, I felt I still had to play pretty hard, it wasn't easy for me to be subtle. The sounds were OK, but I expected more, maybe at this price that's what you get. In any case I sent it back, I gave it three stars because it worked and did what it was supposed to.",1
4305,Sound very very low on playback. I should have listened to other reviewers.,1
4306,"I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner. Not sure if I lost it at a gig, or my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I'd bet the latter.

This micro tuner is smaller and less
obtrusive than the mini, which is nice. That's about the only Pro. There are a few other features I guess, like being able to select the instrument used, but I don't need that.

Cons: The readout is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be as bright. I play a lot of outdoor weddings, in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini.

This micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini. As you move closer to In tune, the bars do not smoothly move towards the center, so it's easy to over or under tune, and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done. And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.

Does it get the job done? Yes. But there is a product that's almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference. It might even be cheaper. If you're a beginner and want to select the instrument you're tuning and a few extra seconds isn't an issue, or you play in dark environments and don't need a super bright readout, this will be fine, but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one.",1
4307,"These clamps are ok for light-duty fixtures.  I'm not sure I'd trust them with anything super heavy or large.  These are very awkward to use, having to turn the knob over and over to installed/tighten/remove/etc.  I also bought some of the kind that wrap all the way around the bar, and they are infinitely more user-friendly and secure.  I recommend spending the extra money and buying the clamps that are the ""clam shell"" design that wraps all the way around.  These clamps aren't worth the money you'll save.  You'll most likely end up like me...wishing you'd put the money on these toward more of the better clamps.",1
4308,"Neat idea (as I have a tweed case, a tweed guitar cable, and now a tweed strap to match). It is an ok strap but I like a wider one when using an acoustic guitar--which is the guitar I use this strap on. It is probably a good strap for an electric--not that great for an acoustic.",1
4309,This has good sound quality and clearness.  The cable itself seems very sturdy yet not too thick.  My complaint is with the ends.  They constantly come unscrewed which is one of my biggest pet peeves with cables.,1

4313,"Basically a TOY.
Super lightweight construction, will not tolerate rough handling. Very bright, controls work well.
Good response to the remote functions.

4314,"This would be a 5 start product except the mounts break--consistently. A sales person at Guitar Center says many are returned with broken mounts, and to be sure and put one drop of oil on the swivel mount as soon as you unpack, before you try to adjust in any way. Still, I've had three of these and all three are in the garbage now. I'm back to my old faithful Intellituner, which is otherwise inferior.",1
4315,serves it's purpose but not my favorite.,1
4316,This product does what it is supposed to do. It really isn't any better or worse than any of the competitor products. There was no volume drop with this as others have indicated. It will hold up well just like any other Boss product.,1
4317,Not a bad drummers throne I use it to play guitar with my gospel group. I like you can adjust  the height . this would make a good beginner drummers throne,1
4318,"First, the quality of the effects are better with this unit than others in the below $300 price range. I've owned and used a great many budget effects units. Most of the cheap-o's are fine for live use but in the studio they really muddy up a mix, sound quite grainy, have a noise ""floor"" that could better be referred to as a desk halfway between the floor and the ceiling. You won't have those problems with this unit.

But, a few negatives. One, the VST plug-in to integrate this unit into your DAW is 32-bit only. It will not work in a 64-Bit DAW. I have PreSonus StudioOne 2 Professional (full) version, and it would not recognize the DLLs for this reason. Nowhere on the box, nor in the owner's manual, nor in the product description in any of the online sales listings I've seen do they mention this substantial limitation. When I contacted Lexicon, they did reply promptly and claimed that this ""product page"" serves as notice of the limitation: http://www.lexiconpro.com/en-US/softwares/mx-edit-mx400-v231-windows. I find that disingenuous, as this page is a page for the 32-bit version of the VST plug-in download and is buried accordingly. And, a brief, buried statement that the 32-bit driver only works on 32-bit systems does NOT convey that there exists no 64-bit driver and the entire selling point of using this device as a plug-in is limited to 32-bit systems. They should include that on the box, in the manual, and in the sales literature that promotes the plug-in feature.

Also, I bought the unit in January 2015 and the included CD-ROM would not install on my system, which is Windows 7. I got an error message from the installer that indicated my operating system is not compatible. It would not successfully install in compatibility mode either. Hard to believe they are shipping CDs in 2015 that only support Windows XP-era operating systems. No problem here, really, as you can download the latest from Lexicon's website. But, it just makes you go ""hmmmm"" and fosters some unflattering perceptions.

Second, the USB connection only controls the unit. It does not pass audio. Therefore, if you are going to integrate this with your DAW using the VST plug-in, you are going to have to pass audio from your computer, to the Lexicon unit, and back- either via analog or S/PDIF at a max of 48KHz. This will eat up inputs and outputs in your interface. As such, if you're currently using all of your I/O channels, you'll need to buy a bigger interface. So, this unit's plug-in feature is really not much different than using any external hardware processor with a DAW- only the fact that you can control the effects parameters from your computer instead of having to mess with the front panel of the device. And again, that is assuming that you have a behind-the-times 32-bit DAW.

Third, I'm not all that impressed with the reverbs. While they are better than other processors in their price range, you can hear the tail of the reverbs drop off in a very stair-stepped pattern. The decay is not smooth. They also sound a bit dark to me. To be fair, if this weren't a Lexicon I'd think it was quite good for the $ (and it is), but it's not what you used to get from the company's previous mid-tier products.

Another thing- none of the effects really blew me away. I much prefer the old LXP-15 II. That unit had a number of patches that would instantly add a WOW factor to a vocal or instrument track. With this model, I can get good results that sound professional and lack that ""cheap reverb/amateur studio"" sound, but I don't get the wow-factor.

Also, as is typical with higher-quality effects units, you don't have as much flexibility to combine multiple effects and fine-control the routing. For example, I have another manufacturer's budget reverb where I can feed into a de-esser effect, route that to an EQ effect that feeds a slapback delay, and in parallel route the output of the de-esser effect to a plate reverb, then sum the paralleled effects together into an exciter that feeds the output. You don't have as many effects or routing options with this one. BUT, that is typical on a unit in this category- your dollars are going toward increased sound quality.

Lastly, part of my decision to purchase was that I could use it as two MX200 units in dual stereo mode. Two discrete Lexicon effects boxes in one physical package. The drawback here, is that the two separate units are summed together internally and sent to one pair of outputs. So, you'll have to mix the levels between the two processors inside the Lexicon unit. That means you can't feed each effect unit's output into its own stereo pair on your console and apply channel strip EQ to each effect independently, which I always like to do.

On the plus side, the chorus effects are quite clean for a budget unit.

Overall, this device is serving a purpose- I needed decent verbs and choruses that won't muddy up a mix or sound cheap for my project studio. I would recommended if you need to fill that need.

4339,"After 4 months of use, here are my thoughts:

It's a good pedal if you're the DIY-type of guy. Why? Thanks to its fairly flimsy soldering job and loose cables within (that white wire in the pic should be connected to where the red-striped wire is soldered to). Even before i opened the housing, the white wire was already pinched against the metal body and needed replacement, anyways. I'd recommend you tape down some of these wires before you start playing.

In terms of functionality, I mean, it's a sustain pedal so it'll do the basic on/off functionality. You press to activate sustain and depress to deactivate. It all works fairly well when the wires are attached, internally. However, while trying to calibrate with Pianoteq 5 software, i realized that the pedal doesn't offer a half-sustain feature, which i didn't even know existed on digital piano sustains. I guess if you're getting into more technical pieces, it MIGHT be a useful function. I'm just a hobbyist so i don't need that precision to satisfy my own ego. In my honest opinion, you won't need that feature from 20+ years of playing and listening to classical piano music.

I do (or did) like that it was compatible with my cheapo Williams Allegro 88 which has god-awful sound coming out of what's being marketed as external speakers which was remedied by spending an extra $300 on a digital audio interface (Steinberg UR-22, but really anything will work if it has the right type of connections, like XLR or MIDI) and a VST (Piano 5, but again, if it's within price range and sounds ok, whatever works).

One thing about this pedal is that it sways left & right about 1/2 inch while using heavily. Don't expect the sturdiness you might feel from an actual piano. The casing is plastic but it feels sturdy and hefty enough. The depression tension is medium (not too stiff or soft) or something that I would expect from any yamaha uprights. The cable length is long enough (5ft) to reach around the back of my desk to they dusty rubber.

Anyways, I'm kinda in a bind since I could either repair this by buying a soldering kit and fixing it or buying a brand new pedal maybe from a more established brand that's compatible with my Williams (apparently not all pedals are compatible with all digital pianos.. which sucks). Any recommendations from an actual owner of a Yamaha, Korg, or Roland pedals?

UPDATE 3/3/2015

So I decided to buy a soldering kit and fix it. I reattached the wires and now it's working perfectly. I guess it's a 5-star pedal if you know how to fix it and a 1-star if you dont... I'll leave it at 3-stars.",1

Was not set up when delivered as was stated in the add, bridge was loose in the box, so be prepared to do this yourself or have it done for you if you are not up to this sort of thing.
Setting the bridge not too hard as far as placement, measure distance from fret side of the nut to 12th fret, then measure same distance from 12th fret to body to place bridge, might want to move the big string side about 1/4 inch closer to 12th fret. That should get your bridge on the body at correct location.
Setting up the intonation is a bit trickier. Should have same tone when you do the harmonic light finger pluck on any string at 12th fret, as when you press the string to the finger board and pluck it. Has to do with the height of the string above the finger board and will take height adj. of the bridge to do. I recommend going online to u-tube for instructions, or to Luthier if not comfortable doing this yourself.
That's why I am not happy with the advertisement saying the instrument was set up prior to shipping. It can be a big deal.

4345,"TL;DR version - pedal sounds good, hardware is 'glitchy' and not very user friendly, support is spotty yet friendly, pedal's ""songs"" (patterns) all start and end with a drum solo - a terrible way to start EVERY song. It's nice having a drum machine in a pedal but honestly, wait for rev 3 or 4 so you get a unit with all the bugs gone and the songs fixed.

Here's the really long version...

Bought one through Indiegogo crowd funding in November 2014. It was supposed to arrive February 2015. With two progress updates extracted from Beat Buddy (BB) and three missed ""arrive"" dates, it arrived late September. Expectations - already let down but let's see what it will do.

I bought the pedal with the extras (the midi cable and the remote footswitch - the footswitch came with a 12"" stereo cord to attach it to the foot pedal). The software for updating the pedal and modifying the songs (no real documentation so I have no idea how to do any of this) was finished a month or two after the pedal arrived and I downloaded it from their (BB's) website. I have a couple of 'cheap' PA systems (minis - like 4 channel powered mixers with speakers) and dedicated one of them to the BB. Learning to get through the the setup (drum choice) is fairly straight forward and almost intuitive. The sound quality from the pedal is good... as though each song (pattern) was a recording and not a bunch of samples  cobbled together to make a complete pattern. Each ""song"" can sequentially go through three distinct fills obtained by pushing the BB pedal once. Each song has a ""part two"" obtained by holding the BB pedal down for two seconds. Each song is ended with a four beat drum solo (as the song was started) after pushing the BB pedal twice in quick succession. During production I received an email stating that ""they couldn't find a durable enough momentary switch for the remote pedal"" so they installed two latching switches - I guess SwitchCraft has gone out of business - I personally don't like the feel of the latching switches.

I was sent an email from BB with a link to a promised firmware update for the pedal supposed fix certain pedal glitches. I followed the link, followed the instructions to install the update and the pedal quit working. After a week or more of emails to BB explaining the situation and asking what to do, I got a response, always with the explanation ""we've been too busy to..."", telling me to ship it back to them. I did. A couple of weeks later I get it back and I just had time, today, to plug it back into the sound system and check it out.

I assume I have the new revision of the firmware installed now that the BB is back from the ""factory"", but the pedal acts exactly like the old software except it's ""glitchier"" and now the remote switch seems to crash the cymbal whenever it wants (seriously - for no apparent reason the cymbal crashes (the left button on the remote) happens whenever it wants - stops when I unplug the remote switch. Also, there were two ways to pick songs (?) from the pedal's inventory but now when one of the knobs is used it simply loads one of the ""blues"" beats. Oh, and the drum solo beginning and ending - still there.

The pluses:

The drum sounds from the pedal are nice - very drum like. It sounds like someone playing a kit that's been well miked. The cymbals are good. Hi hats sound like hi hats... The sound quality coming out of the pedal is good.

The minuses:

Each ""song"" (pattern) starts with a ""drum solo"" - one bar of 'fill'. Most musicians expect a ""click count"" from a drummer, not a drum solo, to start a song. I've asked several times if this can be changed to a click count. When I'm not ignored, I'm told it's fixed. It's not. The songs still start with a drum solo. This is a big headache when recording as it has to be edited out.

Latching switches on the remote - they feel ""wrong"" (the number of pedals a musician has with latching switches? Zero, not counting the OEM switches that come with the amps).

The drum set knob no longer (after the update if I actually got the update) does anything but select one of the ""blues"" songs.

Aside from the annoying drum solo at start and finish, when requesting a ""fill"" via pressing the pedal once, the normally four beat fill starts when the pedal is pushed... if the pedal is pushed one beat ahead of the end of the bar - the fill starts and plays one beat. Pushed two beats ahead of the end of the bar - two beats of fill (of some piece of the fill being used) - this is annoying and sounds bad. Worse, in some instances it sounds off beat.

Oh... and if you slave this though another drum machine via midi, one or the other slowly slides ""off beat"" so that if they both, say, start at the same time at 108 beats per minute, after about four minutes the beats are no longer in sync.

Hopefully, the next iteration of the pedal will have a console that can be placed on a table with a multi buttoned pedalboard that plugs into the console to allow for foot operation of the major functions. Bending over with a guitar on (drummers don't seem to get this) is HARD to do, and shuffling through a couple dozen songs while bent over with  a guitar takes a while and can hurt things. As it is, I got an extension cord to attach the remote switch to the BB so that I can put the BB on a shelf at about waist high - MUCH easier to deal with that way and use the remote for its two functions.

My hindsight says I should have waited until revision 3 or later to buy one. Or waited until the ""other guys"" make a drum machine with a remote footswitch (like I've described) - that would be mo bettah...",1
4346,"This thing does what it's supposed to, but I guess that I was unclear on exactly how the noise would be suppressed.  I thought I could set the threshold high enough to get rid of unwanted playing noise such as sliding noise or the occasional noise generated by an unmuted string that decides to make unwanted noise.

Basically, if you mute the strings, this will eliminate feedback.  It will also get rid of electronic (60-cycle) hum.  It also has a mute feature.  It doesn't do much beyond that.",1

4353,"Let me start this review by saying that I did not purchase it new.  I traded one of my favorite guitars + a little cash for it.  I have been playing more solo gigs of late so I figured this was perfect for me.  I made arrangements to pick up this unit on my way to a gig since the guy lived about a mile from the bar I was playing at that night.  I plugged it in, ran a mic and my guitar through it and it sounded fine.  I have to admit, for the price it fetches, I was expecting a little higher quality sound but I decided to make the swap.  Anyhow, I played my gig that night with the Fishman and I was a little disappointed.  I asked people in the bar how it sounded and they all seemed to like it.  I discovered the next day after reading some reviews that this unit should be placed several feet away from the performer.  Otherwise, it sounds a bit muddy.  This is where I have a problem with it.  Most places I play offer small space to set up, therefore I don't always have the luxury to place the unit several feet away.  I also recently used it as a monitor for my band and they loved it.  We've had some feedback issues with our floor monitors in the past so this was a nice addition to the band sound, but for $1000, that's quite an expensive monitor.  For my acoustic gigs I use a Samson expedition 308 portable mixer and in my opinion it sounds better than the Fishman.  It also costs about half as much.  I tried out a new Fishman Solo Amp at a Guitar Center recently and this one sounded better than mine.  Doesn't everything sound better in a music store though?  Then u get home and you're like, ehh.  I have to say that I'm not sure if I would purchase another one of these if I were in need of a small p.a.  Check out The Samson first.  It sounds as good, if not better, it has 4 channels (as opposed to 2 w/ Fishman) and it costs a whole lot less.",1
4354,"I've purchased a variety of this brands cables. Some are ok. Some suck. I like these cloth wrapped so far.

I don't expect solid gold jacks for 10.00 bucks. So I know what I'm going to get. In many cases with these cheap jacks I wrap some plumbers tape, the stretchy lightweight kind around the threads to keep the damned thing from constantly unscrewing.
They aren't creating ""noise"" so from that perspective they're ok. I would return them if they were. Hope you get one that doesn't fall apart.

4374,"I carry 3 to 5 thin zildjian custom A's (not too heavy as far as cymbals go), along with 6 pairs of jazz 7A sticks (also not too heavy) to practice and local gigs 3 to 4 days a week. I don't treat the bag roughly, as my cymbals are greatly cherished. But in under a year of purchase, one shoulder strap has already ripped off at the connecting seam at the bottom and the other strap is about to tear. I had to re-tie and McGyver the straps to hold up to even normal to medium wear. I'm very disappointed to say the least, considering this bag wasn't cheap. Also, those cymbal separators inside are very flimsy and I had to immediately insert my own that were stiffer so they don't slip down to the bottom of the bag (where the supplied flimsy inserts now reside). So my final review is this: After doing my own handiwork to beef things up, the bag itself is surely secure enough and design wise its a beauty but in real world usage it's not built to last. Even with light to medium weight cymbals the seams of the straps tore. I'll try another manufacturer next time.",1
4375,"I'm giving a 3 because there is an annoying hiss when listening with earphones. It's still there when listening through the speaker, but much less discernible. The distortion is alright, but does not cover a wide enough frequency range and is only near-satisfying on very few settings. But I guess this was never meant to perform like a standard amp, but at least they should have taken care of the earphone hiss, since earphone listening falls directly under the application of this product.",1

4377,"All spring capos lose tension over time.  I've had this capo for a couple of years and it's worked great. Several months ago it severely lost tension so I had to unscrew it, add a couple millimeters of bolts and washers to the shaft, and screw it back together.  It worked for another month or so, but now even at the highest tension it is only capable of holding down the strings on my classical guitar without buzzing.  I was surprised it would fit the wide neck, and I'm glad it will still get some use.

I purchased mechanical capos (Shubb) to replace all of my spring ones.  Same price, but will never lose tension unless they catastrophically fail and fall apart.",1

4379,"The good:
- lag not really a factor
- some of the simulated tones are very accurate representations
- relatively inexpensive for what  you potentially get

The bad:
- volume uneven- i play this through an iPad and Amp and sometimes the volume out of my amp fluctuates dramatically between string strums
- occasionally when switching 'amps' through the app I have to either reset the app or unplug the device as the volume goes to zero
- volume levels vastly different when switching from effects mode to clean
- many of the default amp effect settings have so much distortion it's just noise and I have to turn it way down

overall it's fun to use to try different amp styles, but in a gig setting not realistic or anywhere as good as a decent pedal board",1
4380,"With all of the well-received efforts put into their Music Man guitar line and the popularity explosion in the boutique pedal market over the past several years, it's no surprise that Ernie Ball would jump on board and put their spin on an expanded effects line.  I think most people who have heard of this ""Expression"" series were probably at least intrigued at the concept--a delay and reverb pedal where the repeat level/mix control is an expression pedal rather than a knob.  In my usage of the pedal, I've found it to be solidly built with some thoughtful design, but a number of issues that will probably make its mileage vary with different users according to their needs.

Pros:
-It's beautiful - I think of the finish as copper rather than rose gold, which makes a little more sense to me.  Of course, it's shiny and fingerprints and any scratches you might pick up will show up pretty well.
-The moderately bright built-in plate reverb sounds good.  Contrary to some things I've read, I wouldn't say you can use it as a reverb-only effect by turning down the other effects, as the lowest delay setting still has one repeat.  That said, the reverb meshes really well with the delay sounds and doesn't overpower even at high settings of all the parameters.
-For an expression pedal, it takes up a small amount of real estate, and having the jacks on the end of the pedal enhance its small footprint.
-Operation of the expression pedal and knobs is smooth but firm, which is pretty important for a pedal like this, for me at least, where you don't want your settings easily bumped by accident.
-The digital delay sounds are nice and full, pretty warm, and natural sounding.

Cons:
For my purposes, there are a number of issues with this pedal that prevent it from being especially usable as a studio tool, which is my primary need.
-Maximum settings are pretty tame on all fronts--if you need oscillation or cavernous reverb, you're not going to find them here--it's like the designers tried to determine the ""most useful"" range of settings and then limited the pedal to only those.  If what you're looking for fits within that range, you will probably love this pedal (and 1 full second is a pretty solid delay time range however you cut it), but for me it introduces limitations that my music is often going to butt up against, particularly in terms of repeat feedback, for which I need to have an ""endless"" option available.  Similarly, even with the toe all the way down, the volume of the repeats don't start at quite the same level as the original signal, which is another unfortunate limitation and one not shared by my numerous other delays (e.g., Seymour Duncan's Vapor Trail even allows for initial repeats louder than the original, for some reason).
-I like the idea of marrying parameters to an expression pedal, but having the only option be delay level is both limiting and a bit irritating at times.  Most of the time, if you want to set and forget a delay level setting, it's probably going to be below full volume, and it's pretty tough to accurately nail the same setting every time with a foot control.  The instructions, short though they are, indicate that there's a trim pot ""on the underside of the pedal"" to adjust the maximum mix setting (so you could, for example, make the ""toe down"" setting a lower volume).  This could mitigate the difficulty of finding the sweet spot, but then you're also robbed of the ability to reach full volume without re-accessing the trim pot, which, from what I can tell, is only accessible by removing all 4 foot screws.
-If you adjust any of the parameter knobs while the pedal is actively delaying, the delay sound completely stops until more signal from your guitar passes through.  This is a big bummer for me, as my studio work often involves tweaking parameters of reamped guitar parts on the fly, and this completely nullifies that ability.
-Not necessarily a con depending on your use of the pedal, but it's important to know that the delay circuit receives your guitar signal even when the heel is down, i.e., if you keep playing while your heel is down, your delay settings are still repeating and reverbing the signal and those remaining repeats will be heard as soon as you push your toe down, even if you've stopped playing (depending on the settings, of course).
-Needs a 9v power supply and doesn't come with one.
-No tap tempo included (though there is an input for one); I'm sure people who want to use this live will be especially irritated by this.  Pretty tough to make tempo adjustments without that functionality, and for the price, people are going to wonder why a tap isn't included.

Overall, I think this pedal has a lot going for it and is a pretty good first attempt at an interesting concept, but there are a lot of design improvements I'd like to see before it would be really useful for me.  In its current state, I think it would be most useful in a live setting, where the ""preset"" nature of the settings will probably fit in a lot of people's ideal range, and you can use the expression functionality to enhance a guitar solo, fingerpicking, or even vocals, totally on the fly and probably to great effect to enhance the drama and production values of a live performance in a way that a typical on/off delay can't quite do.  I'm looking forward to continuing to experiment with what I can use it for in a live setting--pedals with increased functionality always get more useful with practice.

For the more mad scientist types (among whose number I count myself), one of the main improvements I'd like to see is the ability to change which parameter the expression pedal controls.  The ability to alter delay time, feedback amount, and even reverb with the expression pedal would all be equally (or more) useful for what I'm trying to do and would add serious flexibility to the pedal and really make it something special that nobody else is doing.  For examples of using an expression pedal with delay time, check out demos of the Boss DM-2W and you'll likely have your imagination piqued as to what would be possible if the expression settings of this pedal were expanded.  In its current incarnation, I would recommend you get your hands/feet on one to demo and see if it's what you're looking for.",1
4381,"The raw audio is not all that great but after running it through EQ it doesn't sound too bad. Must have a poor response curve. Certainly useable as a backup to a boomed shotgun mic. I was afraid of the Rode Rec app because of horrible reviews. I searched for a number of recording apps on the App Store but did not find anything that would give 48 kHz and 16 bit depth and allow adjustable gain. In the meantime, Rode came out with a ""light"" version of their app for free, perhaps a response to really bad reviews. I am now using the free app. It's a pain to adjust the gain as it requires digging through the menus, but it does work. I am using this on a decomissioned iPhone 4. I use a 5s as my active phone. I don't think I would want to give any talent my active iPhone to carry in their pocket. Why would anybody do that? I would never use this microphone if I didn't have a decommissioned iPhone that was not worth more than $50. If you are making enough money to afford it, do yourself a favor and purchase the Senheiser wireless lav. It is ten+ times the cost of this mic. I'm just a poor schmuk so this is all I can afford for the time being.",1
4382,"First I must admit that I really do not like D,Addario strings. The packaging annoys me. Changing strings is always a hassel, because there is no individual packaging. The strings are relatively consistent. They tend to hold up well for a non-coated string. I put these on a 2010 Les Paul Standard Plus, because I could not get the action low enough with 10's. They did the trick. The overall tension and tone made the guitar sing. They do work well....once you get them on!",1
4383,"Fun little amp, I actually play harp through it, don't expect a ton of volume but remember that when it's clipped to your belt lol  Thry don't get any more portable",1

4385,"I won't lie.  I bought this item because I thought it was a great deal for a nice, sturdy case.  I really could have cared less whether or not the harmonicas came with it.  This is a very high quality zipper case with seven slots for the harmonicas to fit snugly inside.

As far as the harps actually go, well, there are two criteria on which to base them.  Yes, they are sturdy and well constructed.  However, they really do play like crap.  I feel like I have to strain my lungs in order to get a decent sound out of these, and that creates some really bad habits for my singing voice.  Furthermore, bending notes is a challenge in and of itself.  Sure, I can bend them and make them sound decent if I'm just playing the harp.  However, since I tend to play the harp and a guitar at the same time, the extra concentration it takes to make a bended note sound good takes away from what I'm playing on the guitar.

As a final note, these things really taste funny.  I think that was the biggest turnoff for me.  The nasty plastic flavoring made me feel like I was being poisoned as I played.  Now I would give these things two stars, because I have played worse harmonicas.  However, I made the purchase for the case.  The case would get five stars.  The harps would get two.",1
4386,Worked great until the clip broke!,1
4387,"This is a high impedance output device, up near the 1 megohm range, meaning a fairly low peak-to-peak voltage output down in the millivolt range. Most modern guitar pickups are fairly low impedance, having an output voltage in the 2V peak-to peak range and about 1K ohms impedance - and the modern amplifiers are also adapted to the newer hum-bucking pickups. I like this as there are times where I can not mic the guitar and this gives me a viable alternative for being able to amplify the guitar as needed. But please note this, it will have a very low output voltage that will not have a lot of output even at maximum input gain, producing a lot of noise with most modern amplifiers. I have opted to use an in-line preamp that is turned on when a guitar cord is plugged into the output and has a potentiometer to set the level as needed. Unfortunately, the preamp cost me more than the pickup, but I like the fact that the pickup has a fairly good range and over all tone quality that does not color the sound of the guitars I use it with. The preamp I use is also neutral in its dynamic range making it possible to use either the amp or mixing board to equalize the tone of the instrument. There are better pickups out there, but I like the fact that this attaches and detaches very quickly and does not mar the finish on my acoustic guitars with round sound holes. My preamp has about 1500 hours life on a single 9V alkaline battery.",1

That being said, for ~$20 it's not a bad deal for a guy like me. But if and when I make any upgrades to my pedal board, this will probably be the first thing to go.",1
4392,"I played Remo Powerstroke 3 heads on my snare drum many years ago.  I used to think there could be no better head.  I played Remo Ambassadors on my toms, a Remo head on my kick.  I loved Remo!

Then, when the Powerstroke was out of stock at my drum shop, the salesmen suggested I try an Aquarian head.  I wasn't impressed because it looked pretty plain, but I needed a head so I gave it a shot.  That was the day I realized the Powerstroke 3 was not anywhere near as good as I gave it credit for being.  It was good with the initial crack, but the sound choked after that when compared with the new heads.  I also noticed that it was far more durable and the surface didn't chip like the Remo.

I still have a clear Powerstroke 3 on another snare drum that I don't play as much.  I pull it out every so often to give it a shot, but I always go back to my main snare within a few minutes.  Even though the clear were never as good as the coated Powerstrokes, but there's still no comparison.  It may sound better in the studio with gobs of reverb thrown on it, but I now realize that the Powerstroke is all attack and doesn't have enough sustain or ring to it to really sound good live.

I don't mean to bag on Remo... it's a decent head, but the truth is that their competition has been making better products.  It's worth giving some other heads a shot just to make sure.",1

The Good:
The tuner is accurate, easy to read, and and has a display that can be used upside down or right-side up.
It's gotten even smaller than it used to be. It's so compact, I can leave it on my classical guitar's headstock and it won't interfere with the hard shell case at all.
The price is great.

The Bad:
This tuner is laggy. When I'm tuning a string up or down, and pluck the guitar string, it will not show any change in pitch. I have to wait a few seconds for the display to turn off, pluck the string again, and suddenly the tuner will show that the pitch has changed. This one aspect has made this tuner frustrating to use. Earlier versions of the NS tuner exhibited this problem too, but to a much lesser degree. I own two classical guitars, and I get the same results on both of them.

Alternative:
The Snark SN-1 tuner (http://www.amazon.com/Snark-13-JQCT-G3R2-SN-1-Tuner/dp/B003VWJ2K8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390954277&sr=8-1&keywords=snark+sn-1) which I've had for a couple of years does not have this lag problem.

Second, though I did not drop it into the sound hole, I will. Third, I can barely see the tuner indicator. I know that is the point, but shame on me for wanting to be able to tell whether or not I am in tune, at a glance. Fourth, it simply does not work that well. A Snark is quicker, easier to read, and stablizes; this tuner is all over the place. When the battery dies, I doubt seriously that I will replace it-just ain't worth it!",1

Trying to exchange them with the vendor was like a Chinese fire drill.  Not at all the easy transaction that it should have been.  It wasn't that they didn't want to do it, but they were just so damned disorganized in dealing with them.  Finally, I gave up.  They are still unopened in my guitar case, so.........",1
4450,"Yes, it's a stompbox pedal, but I bought it to use as a DI. It is called a sansamp, after all. Has multiple settings for mic placement, amp type and gain level as well as knobs for tone (bass & treble) control and separate volume and gain control. Basically, it's supposed to be a Marshall (British), Mesa Boogie (California) and Fender (Tweed) amp modeler. Go to Tech 21s website for specific details about sounds.

The California setting with gain amounts to distortion, The British setting with gain amounts to overdrive. The Tweed setting is my favorite - has a distinctive Fender tone. Even with my humbuckers, I'm able to get a very Jimmy Page tone which is very cool. (I don't know if he ever used a Fender amp, just sayin' it sounds similar to him on a song like For Your Life.) The big issue I have is none of the cleans are totally clean. And the Tweed clean is very muddy and muddled sounding, no matter what you do with EQ. At this price, I definitely expected more. If going direct with this (on Tweed/clean), leaving a room mic open and blended in with the mix helps with the muddiness, but the tone is still a bit overdriven.

I bought it a while back, rarely use it. Definitely try this out before buying, and seek out video comparisons of this and the Behringer version. I can't see buying this as an overdrive/distortion over a Boss SD-1 or OS-2, considering the price. IMHO the GT2 is overrated.",1

4452,"Behringer makes a LOT of electronics for guitar and bass. I have an FCB10 that I use and like, great controller for the price. The CS400 at roughly 20.00 is a decent pedal that will 'get the job done'. Is it equivalent to a Boss, Dynacomp, Visual Sound or Keeley compressor...nope. You will get 20.00 worth of use out of it though for sure. The housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a PITA. Just don't take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year. Good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point.",1
4453,"These do exactly what they are supposed to do--hold your music.  Sometimes they get in the way of the notes, but they are clear so usually if you tweak their position, you can work around that; the lower part that clips to the stand will keep them from falling off if you have to wiggle them out of a flush-against-the-music position.  Minus one star for not fitting my Peak collapsable music stand, which has a thicker than normal tray. But they really are made for the Manhasset, so I probably shouldn't penalize for that! But I'm going to, since usually when I need these it is for an outdoor gig, to which I have brought my own portable stand, rather than a bulky metal Manhasset stand! Good product, serves it's purpose.  Awkward to store and transport because of their length and shape. I'm always afraid I'm going to break them in my gig bag. Better than my old alligator-clip style clips, which had to either clip at the top of the music (going down the page, like these), or on the side, holding horizontally.  I like that these clip at the bottom, and seem more secure. You can also clip thicker music with these because of how they attach to the ledge of the stand. I don't know if there is a better product available or not, but I want to leave room for the perfect music clip, so I'm sticking with three stars.",1

If I were to get a larger neck size to promote entry then the overall body size would be too big for my finger.

The set screw is not functional as it ships. you will need to drill out the inner plastic ring if you wish to use it. The inside diameter measures about 6mm (.236 inch) as shipped. It is similar to a Telecaster Knob 17mm compared to 19mm (Tele) with a domed top compared to the Flat top of a Tele. They do not  include any indicators, unless you consider the set screw hole one. It's worth the cost if you get free shipping.",1

But later when I replaced strings on a quality guitar, I realized that overall these strings have a less-vibrant, duller sound right out of the package.  I tried them because in my years of playing I've never tried the Martin classical line of strings so thought I'd give it a go.  I find though the same results that I did with their ""silk & steel"" set; it's an ""okay"" string, but not a great string.  I've always used D'Addario in the past and that's what I'll go back to; the difference is major.  I'll save this set for ""backup strings"" or for a cheaper instrument, but for my prime guitars I'll stick to what's always worked in the past.  No more experimenting for me.  If it ain't broke...",1

4500,"If you need a inexpensive home theater PC speakers MS40 are fun. Their mids and highs are sweet e the mid-bass line is satisfatory. Those ones who intend to listen to MP3 and watch movies on PCs will enjoy MS40.

On other hand, if you need a reference monitor for recordings, forget it! No way! MS40 is quite uneven, lacks resolution and clarity on mid band and its treble has absolutely no resolution. Bass lines isn't good enough also, because of its lack of control and velocity (they are boomy speakers). Their quite apparent boxiness also let MS40 down.

Looking for a entry level reference monitor? I would recommend to spend a bit more and get KRK Rockit RP5G2 or a M-Audio BX5A. They cost twice as much, but sound 4 times better. You can't afford any of them as your budget is short, so go with M-Audio AV30 or AV40. In my opinion, even the chep M-Audio AV20 offers better mid and treble resolution than behringer MS40.",1

The treble strings have been always unwounded to give a contrasting sweet lyrical sound in the trebles. This is the first set where all the strings are wound & the resulting sound is .... just okay
I thought the treble strings would be silver wound & be very bright so i thought it may be a good match for my lutheir built flamenco guitar. strangely the trebles are wound in plastic. The sound of these plastic trebles is somewhat like hearing the upper frets of the wound bass strings. For example, the 1st e strings sounds like holding the 14thfret on the D string.
I cant imagine them being suitable for any classical performance. Maybe for a flamenco sound or even a unique pop guitar tone. the sound is somewhere between nylon strings & steel. not as mellow as nylon & Not as bright as steel. It may work well with a dark sounding guitar if u want a different brighter,percussive snappy sound. However note that these strings are not extremely different from a general savarez high tension set. Just a little snappier but with lots of squeak cos of the wound trebles.
Here's my only complaint : the finger squeak is unbearable ! i cant imagine using it for a studio recording (no one can listen to every string squeaking)even if u have very clean technique.",1

They are also now -after a few months of that same occasional and gentle use- beginning to shed the black coating at frequently fretted positions.  I use a medium nylon pick, but still the coating isn't too happy at the picking position, either.  It seems to me the coating DR uses is nowhere as durable as that on Elixirs.

4530,"Years ago I first spotted the MS-2 in a store window on 48th St and thought it was a promo item - the sort of thing manufacturers give out to retailers to catch peoples' eyes. The irony of a pint-sized version of the iconic Marshall stack was hysterical - and this was years before today's 3 and 4ft mini-stacks that, for some reason, I don't find quite as amusing.

The MS-2 was considerably cheaper back when I got mine (it's stamped 'Made in Korea' which I doubt is still the case), and that's my main problem: relative bang for the buck.

Considering not just Marshall's other practice models but the sheer range of amps in the 1-15 watt space, buyers should really ask themselves what they want such a small amp for.

I will say the little guy has been a favorite conversation item, but a useful piece of playing or recording equipment? Not really.

The plastic box is so light that you'll have to steady it when you're plugged in. As someone else mentioned, I noticed problems keeping battery power constant and would recommend a 9V DC adaptor to squeeze what little power there is out of it. The clean tone for such a small speaker is not bad, but like ships, that's not what Marshalls are made for (IMO). Unfortunately, the distorted tone is, well, just not very realistic.

And yeah, I did try close-miking the MS-2 once to see if I could get that Physical Graffiti crunch on tape. What I got was interesting in its own right but wouldn't fool anyone. (Maybe if I triple-tracked it...)

The 1 watt ouput would have a hard time being heard over some acoustic instruments so if you're at all interested in playing with others, you'll need more juice.

If you're an electronics experimenter, the MS-2 is useful to have on your bench for low-volt audio output. I took the back off once and the board and construction are actually quite clean. I'll bet it's a great candidate for circuit benders and hardware hacks and somewhere there must be a site dedicated to outrageous mods.

I don't mean the knock the MS-2 too hard for being what it is - a 1 watt wonder. At half the price it's going for it would make a great stocking stuffer and a fun gift.

But if you're really interested in a decent-sounding small amp for practicing or recording and you're already considering spending $40, I'd strongly suggest you explore what's available for another 20 or 30, including a classic Pignose that can sound terrific close-miked if that's your thing. Decide whether you'd rather play a 5-10 watt amp cranked or a 15-20 watt amp clean; either way there's plenty to choose from.",1

I give them credit I had a replacement next day. I have been fiddling with it for 2 days now the tuners aren't quite right too much slack and was hearing a screeching/squeeking noise when playing. THEN I noticed the saddle has a big chunk out of it under the 2nd string between it and the 3rd strings, so back again it's going! Then I started thinking I wonder if they are shipping 2nds in hopes no one will notice. I was in two minds whether to ask for refund or is see if 3rd time really a charm.

4577,"I own both this and the DW remote.  This is a great remote, don't get me wrong.  However.. the DW is better.

Few places where this falls short:
1) no real easy way to disconnect the cable
2) no easy way to buy alternate lengths of the cable, should your setup require it
3) no mounting hardware.  (need to buy your own clamp which adds to the overall price)
4) only comes with a drop clutch to mount your hi-hat.  If for some reason you don't want to (or simply can't based on your setup) use a drop clutch, you'll have to buy more hardware which adds to the overall price.

On top of all that, after playing both the DW and the Pearl for a few months each, I can say that the DW is just plain smoother AND quieter.  All you hear is the sound of your hi hat.  With this, you hear the pedal and cams moving every time.

Though one positive, since I already had the Pearl Eliminator double bass pedal, this matched perfectly, and my OCD was sated. =)",1
4578,"Sounds fine with no hum or other noise and the jacks are solid and fit my amps snugly, but the cable is stiff and lacking flexibility.

Bad: The thing is pretty big (the mic itself has more than 1/2"" diameter, the whole clip is about 2"" long) and it may be hard to put it in the sound hole - the clip touches strings and/or fingers. So, it may be rather tricky to place it on a guitar. I tried to clip it to the fretboard head, but it captures a lot of string noise and finger tapping, the sound is terrible. Clipping it to the bridge works better, but still not perfectly. Probably the best way of attaching it will be to remove the clip completely and tape or glue the mic directly to the body.

4587,"There is a lot of controversy about the ""Martinness"" of this. I do not much care about that. What I can say is it is thicker, overall less pliable, longer, and more bulky than its competition: the Dampit. The Dampit feels like it has been specially designed and made from a specialized rubber material. The Humitron feels like the generic equivalent of a Dampit. It is harder to squeeze and harder to bend and holds less moisture.

This does not come with any type of soundhole cover or penlike clip like the Dampits do, but I like the rubber lip on the Humitron's end a little more than what you get on a Dampit. That said, because the tip is oversized, it collects water and kinda hides water there. It takes about three or four times to final soak all the water up from the tip if you submerge the entire humidifier, so I try to leave the tip out of the water to avoid that issue.

In terms of the basic design, it makes sense and it is convenient for both sound hole and f-hole guitars. It will even fit in f-hole mandolins but it is a little long for them. That said, I am not sure how much moisture these type of humidifiers really hold to be functional in a very dry area. I would this or a Dampit in combination with another humidification method if you are are a dry area. In order to get them not to leak, you have to squeeze so much water out that it feels like--and this may be an optical delusion--that nothing adequate is left inside. And these types of humidifiers, in general, are a little difficult to tell when they are dried out, unless they are REALLY dry. I am new to using them, but I prefer sponges that have some size to them so that I can touch them or shake them and know immediately if they are dry or not. Dampits and Humitrons need to be taken to the sink and squeezed to test them, unless you want to drip water out. Then, my impression is, that that water you just squeezed out via testing just wasted the little amount that was in there, and you have to soak it again. These are first world problems, I know.",1

4593,"I purchased this QuikLok BS317 for holding my Fishman Loudbox, which has a 15-inch width. The QuickLok did not work for the Fishman because as the rubber bumpers were about 1 inch too widely spaced to cradle the amp. I temporarily made do by supplementing the rubber bumpers with cut pieces of preformed tube pipe insulation, which sort of worked. However, there was a more serious problem, which is that the upright arms on the QuickLok that support the back of the amp covered up some of the plugins on the back of the amp. These QuickLok upright arms are welded in place, a bad design flaw. Therefore, it's impossible to adjust them to uncover plugins you want to use.

Another issue is that this isn't only ""low profile"" in the sense that it folds up, it is also ""low"" in that it doesn't hold amps far off the floor -- only about a foot off the floor (I don't have the unit here to measure, but that's about right.

It seems like some design changes would help. One very simple one would be to make the rubber bumpers wider so that they can support smaller amps. Another nice addition would be sliding back supports that could be positioned so they don't cover the plugins.

I ended up buying a Stageline AS7 that worked well for my smaller, 15-inch-wide amp. It has sliding back supports so the plugins aren't covered, and it raises the amp about 20 inches. The Stageline AS7 is made to raise the amp up to 27 inches, but I didn't feel it was stable enough at that height (see my review of the Stageline AS7).",1

My husband has been playing for years and I was surprised when he said the covers on on the pegs at the top were a smart idea for kids.  I believe they are intended to hold the strings in place better.  My kids just like to play around on it.

For kids that really want to learn, there are little cards you can use to learn the cords and a few spare strings were even included.  Is it a guitar appropriate for music lessons?  Probably not.

After a couple of weeks I ordered another ukulele and waited for that to arrive before starting to work on the action.  I took a lot off the nut and currently there's an occasional buzz when I fret the 'a' string at the first fret.  It still frets a touch sharp at the first fret but acceptable.  My 2yro son has taken ownership of this ukulele and plays it when I play my current one.  I'll probably work on the nut some more in the future if my son doesn't destroy it.

4611,"Pretty damn good pedal for the first bit. Very sturdy casing. First impressions are great with a smooth, lower voiced wah with a surprisingly nice sweep. Slightly more bass than a standard GCB95 Cry Baby, but never gets as muddy as the Dunlop does in the heel position. The volume side is great as well, not as slow of a sweep as many full sized pedals, but that's to be expected and it does a great job for those looking to start playing more ambient stuff! No tone sucking either! That being said, right out of the box, both of the input jack sockets felt loose and I'd often need to press it right up against another pedal on the board to avoid the patch cables coming out. A month after purchasing it, I noticed a subtle crackling in the upper sweep of the wah. Two weeks later and that crackling has only gotten louder and worse, now enveloping the entire sweep with the unpleasant crackle of a bad pot. I suspect this would be an easy fix for knowledgable pedal tinkerers, but it's something that needs to be addressed.  For the price I payed, I really can't complain too much as the volume side works just fine, but, as many other users have reported, the wah side has an expiration date of sorts.",1

4614,"These strings have good sound to them if you play bluesy rock music, but I find they don't last very long. I prefer DR or GHS which are the same price range but last better. Go for the pure blues DR and you won't regret it.",1
4615,"If you are looking for a good deal on some cymbal stands, these are great. The fold up nice and everything. Only down side is that they are very light weight and thin. I wouldn't want to put a 22"" cymbal on the boom with these.",1

4617,Better for audio used. Not my favorite for the road.,1
4618,"Like the other Vine reviewers, I received one speaker to audition.  Reviewing one speaker is kind of like reviewing one shoe...but here goes.  :)

I've owned NHT 1.5 speakers for just over 16 years now, and those are known for their fairly flat response.  So, I think that I have a frame of reference when evaluating this design.  To be fair, I have yet to hook this up to all of the equipment that I'd like to and play different material.  So far, I've managed to connect it up to my TV.

I like that these are active monitors and have a built in amplifier.  However, regardless of the connections, when my speaker is turned on and the volume turned above zero, there is an immediate and noticeable hiss.  I was disappointed by that, and that's disconcerting to me in a speaker designed (IMO) for near field listening.  If I was using this in my living room at my normal distances of about eight to ten feet, I likely wouldn't hear it unless it was later at night.  However, sitting a couple of feet away from them, it's obvious to me.

The sound to me had its highlights, but it was overall in the ""okay"" category.  I thought that the bass had good volume and was clean, and most sounds were distinctive and clear.  The combined sound, though, seemed a little ""muddy"" to me and not at the same level as my NHTs.  The NHTs were about twice the price when new, but they are 16 years old, and the other reviews here are mostly very positive.  I didn't think that the sound was horrible by any means, but mine was not a glowing five-star experience.  That makes me wonder if I haven't given it a fair chance or if I got a dud (when also considering the hiss).

With the sound quality that I've experienced so far, combined with the hiss that is very noticeable at closer distances, I'd rate these as ""Okay"" (three stars).  I do wonder if I haven't given them a fair chance, so I will update this review if my opinion changes in the future.

Notes (not Pros or Cons, just things to think about):
(*) A number of folks on the Audioholics forum that I frequent consider using active studio monitors for computer speakers.  If that interests you, be sure to look at the dimensions, especially if you plan to use these on your computer desk.  They are not small and are relatively deep compared to other computer speakers.  Also, with the port being in back, you'll want to have some space between these and the wall.
(*) The connections are not typical commercial connections.  XLR and 1/4"" TRS connections may not be something that you already have cables for, so you might need to pick some up to use these.  Using the TRS connections is likely the easiest choice for most folks, and getting cables is fairly inexpensive.
(*) There is no speaker grill.  Cosmetics aside, that's something to consider if you have young kids or pets.
(*) This item listing is a single speaker, so double the price for a pair.",1
4619,"Its a decent overdrive pedal, but a bit dark sounding for my single coil guitars.",1

4621,The pick itself it's fine but it was too thin for me,1
4622,"Keyboard section is great. Synth action on the keys, not weighted, but still good for players whose fingers are used to piano or weighted keys. I found it easy to switch between this, a weighted keyboard, and piano.
Drum (launch) pads are not sensitive enough, which will be a real disappointment for expressive finger drummers. Hits at the lower velocities often did not take, and I found it mostly un-useable for drum playing. Sensitivity on the pads can't be customized. Also, it isn't possible to change these pads to other midi notes, or reconfigure any midi outputs at all, so for those of you who like to customize your keyboards to your liking, that option is not available.
It is quite easy to change the midi channel of the keyboard, making it good for players who use different virtual instruments on different midi channels.
The drum pads, however, always stay on midi channel 10.
Lightweight but still feels sturdy; good for travel.
Intuitively made, and it's easy to figure out what every knob and button is capable of. That it is not customizable will be a limitation, ultimately, but I'm using it along with an Akai MPD218 drum pad, which makes up for the non-expressive drum pads on the Launchkey.",1

4626,"I paid a bit more to purchase the actual Shure brand and it's OK but not great. Thing is, it looks awkward on the mic. It's a bit too big for an SM58 particularly at the bottom. There's no tapering off at the bottom but instead it just kinda stops sticking out around the bottom of the ball like a skirt. It's a case of function over form because it works keeping pops and breath noise off the element, but man it's not the fit or finish you'd think it should have being made with the Shure name attached to it. One other thing to mention, the foam itself is not as ""fine"" as I'd like if you know what I mean by that. Not sure how else to describe that aspect. Bottom line is that I've paid far less and gotten better foam windscreens than this name brand.",1

4629,"For just a little more, you can purchase a cremona, which is a quality instrument.  This violin, though more expensive than a Crescent; really didn't live up to my expectations.  It also came with a serious nick in the back that ate through to the wood.  I wouldn't highly suggest it.",1

4632,"This is a great idea, but unfortunately it did not work for me.  To start. I cleaned the edge of the fret board with isopropyl alchohol and made sure that dried completly before appling the dots. They were only on the guitar two weeks before they began to flake off.  Within a few days of that they were gone.  I had previously used office dots that are used for color coding file folders.  The office dots last about the same lenght of time.  In fairness I will add, I practice 3 hours a day.  So, maybe in that regard they held up quite a few hours.  But, they are too expensive to replace every 2 - 3 weeks.  I think, if dots are needed (I like having them)  it's better to put them on top of the fret board under the strings where fingers won't touch them.  If they stick there they might last longer.",1

4635,"As I read earlier, if you're looking for a nice deep bass drum sound, you're not going to get it by simply plugging this into a guitar amp.  I use my drum amp which has a nice low end.  It's still not as deep a sound as I prefer, but does sound okay.  One issue I have with it, is the amount of threads on the 1/4 inch jack that stick out of the block.  The nut came off on mine and it took me almost an hour to fix because there were so few threads for the nut to grab on to...  and really no way to get hold of the jack while putting on the nut.  I'd still recommend getting one of these if you're looking for convenience, but I'd also keep with it (I believe) a 12mm box wrench and tighten that nut up before use.",1

4639,"I got this stand because I liked the idea of having something portable with nice leg room.  However, it wasn't as stable as I hoped.  I'm using it with an 88-key Yamaha P-120 keyboard, and I had to extend the length of the stand all the way in order to rest the keyboard on its rubber feet (without putting just the flat bottom of the keyboard on the stand).  For some reason, they put large holes on the table top, and these made it more difficult for me to rest the keyboard on its rubber feet.  I had to position it just right.  At full length, the middle of the stand sags a bit kind of like a curtain rod at full length without any center support.  As I played the keyboard, it was ""stable"" but not $50 stable.  It wasn't very difficult for me to wobble it side to side.  For me, it felt kind of rickety.  The overall construction just doesn't give me full confidence that my expensive keyboard is resting on something reliable.  It does the job, but I would feel better if I paid half the price.

This stand is probably more appropriate for smaller keyboards or sound boards.  I do not recommend it for full-size keyboards that are moderately heavy.",1
4640,"I bought this Capo as my very first Capo as I started learning Guitar since July 2014.  Did extensive research and found this stylish and many good reviews.  Now after about 5 months of practice, I feel this Capo is good to some extent as it is impressive and eye catching. But But......

I didn't like it that much as it is pretty inefficient if used on the first fret.  String A & B buzzes a lot.  I have to re-adjust capo close to metal fret, then far away, mid way and somehow I do get a position where strings dont' buz, but when I start playing guitar, they somehow start to buzz again. Real disappointment there.

Also, when I press this capo on the string with my hands and strum then there is no buzzing at all.  The moment I let go and strum, then strings start to buzz again.

Conclusion: this is a very nice goodlooking, eye catching, impressive-stylish Capo, but it doesn't have that ""required"" press on the string if used on the first fret.  It seems okay to be working on second fret and other ones BUT NOT on FIRST FRET.  Why its a disappointment as I really needed it for the first fret play as my favorite song is played with Capo on first fret.
It is good but not good.  Why waste so much of money when it is not doing it's job on the first fret?",1
4641,"It should allow you adjust the band strength and should have something to protect the upper side of the finger. Afte playing for few minutes, it starts hurting the finger. You should use an adhesive plaster when performing with this.",1
4642,"I accidentally bought 2 of these flutes from 2 different sellers (thought I was buying a different key and by the time I figured it out, the 2nd one had already shipped).  They're both made by the same company and for all purposes ""identical"".  One however was made from bamboo with a more open-core, the other a more closed-core.  The first one played well, the second didn't play well at all.  I suspect though that with an instrument this cheap, it's ""luck of the draw"".  So I'm placing this review in both places to help beginning players.

One has to realize this dizi is under $4.  Compare this to the typical street-vendor standard which usually sells for $10 to $30 for the exact same thing... and this is a decent buy.  On mine the notes are accurate (even on the not-so-playable one), it is thread-bound to prevent the bamboo splitting, and the ends are paint-sealed for durability.  I think that's about all anyone could expect from a dizi at this price.

The voice is very high... a soprano.  It's not a piccolo, but it's high for a flute.  If you've seen dizi played on YouTube you've probably watched concert-level flutes... much more difficult to play and much lower voiced (even so, comparatively high voiced).  A Xiao is a much lower-voiced flute in general, and significantly more expensive.  The dizi is a high-voiced, inexpensive instrument.

If you're a beginner be aware that you must put a piece of tape over the hole following the aperture (or the flute won't play at all).  Ordinarily this hole is covered by a ""dimo"" tissue (bamboo membrane) for the traditional dizi tone, but one cannot expect extensive accessories at this price level.  (Still, one would think the manufacturer would slap a piece of tape on there... just to prevent disgruntled customers.)

Be aware that sellers will often sell the same brand of cheap dizi and call it a ""concert"" or ""professional"" dizi, and charge double or triple the normal price.  Don't be fooled by this.  There are dizi out there that sell for $70, $100 or more and they ARE pro-quality flutes.  But take a close look at the listings, compare one listing to another, and don't pay $50 for a flute you could buy for $15 from another seller.  One tell-tale mark of cheap flutes is white plastic or painted tips rather than ""horn"" tips (even artificial horn is better).  White plastic or painted tips (such as this model) is a sure-sign of a cheap dizi.

My suggestion:  spend more and get a decent dizi.  Do some research on the net regarding dizi, watch a bit of YouTube and find out what they are and how they're played, then spend $20 to $30 and get a dizi with all the trimmings.  You'll be far more satisfied with your purchase and get much more pleasure from playing it.

For $20 to $30, a dizi is a very inexpensive musical instrument.  If you want to play a dizi flute, I recommend skipping the cheap ones and investing in a ""good"" flute.  I own a $30 dizi (key of C) and I'm much happier with that flute.  For beginners, a key of D or E is recommended as a starter instrument.  Buy a $20 to $30 D-key dizi and you'll be far more satisfied with your purchase.  As my dad once told me: good quality is remembered long after low price is forgotten.",1

4646,"I only issued a three star rating to raise a caution flag with this harp.  It is not a typical diatonic harp, and if you are expecting it to sound and perform like one, you will be disappointed.

It is a fine, well-made partially-valved harmonica, and if you desire to experiment with a valved harp, the Promaster Valved Harp is a fine choice.  But, to reiterate, if you like the sound of standard diatonic harp and want a harmonica that will perform like one, this is not the harmonica you are looking for.  It can be harsh and unpredictable in tone and its reeds can sometimes buzz, blurt, or honk abruptly.  I am an experienced harp player and perform regularly. And I have no doubt an experienced player could have some fun with this instrument.  And If you are interested in this harp as a musical experiment, go for it.  But, if you want a good diatonic harp that will play and perform as you expect one to, this harmonica will be a squawky, quirky disappointment.  Order the regular Promaster (or Crossover, or Special 20, or Bluesmaster, or Olive, or, to save some money, a Big River).",1

Almost all home receivers/amps are rated for 8 ohms.  You would be overdriving you amp with these speakers. I went through the Amazon community to find out the true rating of the speakers, and I got several answers saying they were 8 ohm speakers.  When I received them, they indeed said 4 ohms on the back of the speaker.  If Pyle made these in 8 ohms, I would have kept them, but I had to return them.  Good thing Amazon is very understanding and honored my return.  I'm thinking that these speakers were made for marine applications because most boats have car stereos in them and car audio is usually running at 4 ohms.",1
4654,"Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat?  You can't with this!  It's too narrow at 17 inches.  I am going with a wider one.  (other than that is seems decent)

4660,I have been very pleased with other GLS Audio and Ethercon cables.  I thought I'd try to save a few bucks on these Speakon Connectors.  They are not as good as Neutrik.  The termination markings are very hard to read.  They also fit very tightly into genuine Neutrik female connectors built into amps.,1
4661,"Please read the whole review before you decide. If you want perfection ROTB, or just don't want to make any adjustments...you should probably  look elsewhere.
Bottom line: Pretty good!  When I first tuned it up ROTB, I didn't think much of it. It rattled, it had very uneven volume from each string,the action was high, and the top string (Hi-G) was so hard to press that it was unplayable. But I'm a tweak-freak. With any instrument, a buyer should expect a certain amount of ""Set up"". So I started making a few minor adjustments, and things quickly got A LOT better.
STEP 1, I adjusted the string heights (with the provided Allen wrench) at the Bridge (the bottom end) of the ukulele. This fixed the rattle. STEP 2, I removed the Hi-G string (which was FAR too thick a string for the job) in favor of a low G- a wound 32 gauge Ernie Ball Guitar (4th) string. Immediately this transformed it into a viable uke. MUCH easier to play. I haven't tried it strung with a Hi-G yet, but it would probably be do-able with a .10,.12 or. 14 gauge electric string. But I wanted it Lo-strung anyway. Those were the biggies, and ANYONE regardless of experience SHOULD be able to do those things, albeit by trial-and-error. Do those things, and you'll have a PRETTY good instrument. It's beautiful, the finish is excellent, knobs and switch work well. Tuners are great. Bridge hardware is a little cheesy, but it works. The pickups sound great in terms of tone BUT I had some hum in the volume knob, probably due to dicey grounding. In my unit, this goes away when the volume pot is maxxed out,which is okay because I do volume adjustments at the amp. It also might be fixable with more tweaking, but at this writing it was still there. Now, on to the smaller (and more complicated) adjustments. STEP 3, I removed and sanded the headnut to lower the action. This GREATLY upped the playability, and I recommend (but do not require) it. But its glued down well and while trying to remove it, I BROKE it. It's also easy to ""overdo""this step, SO if you're not equipped or prepared for this step, I'd skip it or leave it to an expert. I had a replacement, so I'm glad I did it. STEP 4 I  CAREFULLY adjusted the pickup heights to taste with a Phillips screwdriver. This made the strings all equally loud. STEP 5, I adjusted the string intonation at the Bridge. All these steps took a total of about 90 minutes. When I got done, it sounded great (minus for the hum), played great, and looked great. Intonation and action were totally acceptable. Is it worth the money? For me it is. I've played many instruments that cost more and delivered less. You can make a wide range of sounds on it from sweet to shred (YES you can totally SHRED on this thing) if you have the chops and the FX/amp. So...it's a good instrument IF you are willing to make adjustments.  Three stars for what they sell you...Four-and-a-half for what you can make of it. One final thought: If you want an authentic Hawaiian ukulele sound, you might also consider an Electrified ACOUSTIC ukulele. This unit gives you the notes, but it's a world apart from the classic ukulele sound. Having several traditional ukuleles, that difference is what I wanted. Before finalizing this review, I plugged in and played the ukulele, just to assess the overall purchase. Am I glad I bought it? Yep!
****UPDATE**** The more I play it, the better I like it. Surprisingly good for Blues/Fusion sounds. I still need to max out the volume (or touch any string) to get rid of the hum, but, for this price, I can live with it. Make it Four Stars!",1
4662,These cables worked alot better when they were made here.  These cables do not have the quality they once did. I have owned many of these some I purchase over 17 years ago.  I still use them.  These are not made as well.  Their good but not the same quality.,1

4665,"Let me start by saying I'm a die-hard D'Addario user; I've used their strings exclusively for over 20 years, mainly EXL-110s.  After hearing about these new and improved strings from a guy at the local guitar shop, I was excited to try them.  I really, really, REALLY wanted to like them - and I did, until one broke after 5 days.

For the most part, they really do live up to the hype.  First off, 5 of the six strings definitely required less stretching than a set of EXLs before they held their tune.  However, the high E string required as much or even more stretching; it really took about 10 min of stretch, play, repeat, before it settled down.

The tone of these strings is OUTSTANDING.  They really are hotter, and every single tone in my rig was improved, whether clean or high gain.  It really opened my eyes that I can do better than the same old strings I've been using for so long.  I'm definitely not a cork-sniffer when it comes to tone, but these things are the real deal.  I could HEAR it.  And they just feel really good to play, like a little smoother and slinkier than EXLs.  They are honestly a joy to play and hear and I really wish I was writing the 5 star review they deserve on most counts, BUT...

Five days.  I put on the new set on Mon evening, and the A string just broke on Sat afternoon.  I've never even broken an A string on this guitar, which is only about 6 months old and in excellent condition,  It's not a burr on the saddle, or any other such thing,  If I'd bought them at GC I'd be headed there to get my money back.  Now I'm in a tough spot: I've found something that definitely sounds better than what I've been using, and from a company I've been loyal to for two decades, but at 3 times the cost and questionable reliability.  At $12 a set I'm not likely to roll the dice on more sets of these; it might be time to explore my options by trying some other brands.  I know, strings break all the time, but as a gigging musician it's something you do what you can to avoid.  I generally don't go more than about 2 weeks without changing strings, depending on how much I'm playing, but I really was hoping I could stretch that out (because of the 300% price increase) with these.  Maybe I wouldn't be so pissed if they didn't claim to be ""the strongest electric guitar string ever made.""  Nope.  Fantastic tone, though.",1
4666,"The screw holes line up perfectly on my 2001 American Standard Stratocaster, but the hole to access the bridge block is not in the same place as the bridge, so I cannot change a full set of strings without removing the cover.

4667,As described.,1
4668,Was really looking for an around the neck strap where the strap actually goes under the guitar up the front then clips onto the hole but this one being so short that it clips straight to the top of the hole.

4674,"I got this for a Fender MIM jazz bass body that I completely customized.  I will say that I like the fact that it retains the Fender vibe and isn't as chunky looking as the Leo Quan and Hipshot A style bass bridges I have on my other jazz basses.  I like the slightly thicker base plate and the fact that the outer two saddles are in grooves to aid in saddle stability.  I also like the front two mounting screws for added  bridge contact.  That is where my likes for this bridge end.  First thing I noticed was that the supplied screws were of a smaller diameter than the stock Fender mounting screws.  I had the use a round tooth pick and super glue in each of the holes to provide enough grip for the Gotoh screws.  The second problem I encountered was that the grub screws to set the saddle height were way too long.  I like a very low action and the saddle adjustment screws were left sticking up out of the saddle.  Since I play mostly finger style, it isn't a big problem.  When I palm muted with a pick, the grub screws became an annoyance because they were digging into my hand.  Another problem is the fact that the saddles have only one string groove which doesn't allow for proper string placement over the pickup pole pieces.  It isn't a real problem as the pickup still works fine without the string centered between the poles, but I am kind of OCD when it comes to that issue.  If you use Bartolini, EMG, or any other type of covered pickup, it isn't noticeable at all.  I ended up switching the saddles with the threaded Fender saddles off my old bridge.  I still have a super low action AND the ability to adjust the string spacing.  All in all, this is a decent bridge, just be aware of these issues if you plan on a future upgrade with this unit.",1

While it's a great fit for our sm58's and Audix OM's it is way too small for the big fat Freeport mic. Not the clips fault but I thought that some potential buyers might want to know this.

IMO this is a pretty crazy high price for a single mic clip given all the other options out there. I do like the fact that it is not made of hard, rigid plastic that looks like it could snap at any moment. Note that the threads are plastic once you remove adapter piece.

Once you start tightening you can feel and see it starts to bend, so just be carefull when you installed it. As I said, it's a great cosmetic upgrade but I still don't feel confortable being so thin.",1
4679,"The printing on the entire strap is alright, but not awesome. It's Genuine leather (read, not real solid leather, but reconstituted from leather dust and scraps, like a Pringles chip). Would be much better as full-grain leather. The underside has a suede-like texture which prevents the strap from sliding freely on my shoulder (maybe that's yoru cup of tea, but I want movement so my shirt doesn't move around).

I think this would be a good starter strap for the kid who's not been playing for very long and wants to look bad ass and brvtal. It's got that part right. But it's not a pro quality strap that I'd want to use on stage.

Your mileage may vary.",1

4681,"Good picks. I don't think there such a thing as a mandolin pick, a banjo pick or guitar pick. There are picks and I find the best for the type of music I am playing. Picks get lost offten and more than offten they get stolen. These things are so over priced just because they are call mandolin picks. I paid $2.99 at a local music shop. I use them mostly for my 12 string. I use heavy 1.5 mm picks and very light .43 mm picks for my mandolins.",1

4686,Myself and our second KB player purchased these stands to achieve a matching look. The stands look great on stage but being as anal retentive as I am I notice the legs aren't perfectly straight and it bugs me. They tend to bow in a little and I'm always kicking the legs to try and get the stand to look right to my eye. The audience doesn't notice this I'm sure.,1
4687,"I have used a number of high end music programs so I must admit I am a bit spoiled. Unfortunately most of the high end programs are geared toward music production and distribution via digital formats not paper based distribution. My first experience with sheet music generating programs was an old program from Cake Walk. I believe it was called Music Write. You may still be able to find it cheap on Amazon or E Bay. Cake Walk made a more sophisticated version called Music Write 2000 which I never had much success with, but this gives you an idea the vintage of this software, It could only manage a single instrument line (both Bass and Treble Clef). It allowed adding guitar chord diagrams and lyrics. It allowed you to connect to a midi keyboard as both input and output so you could hear your creation with various instruments. It started recording directly from your keyboard and stopped when you hit stop or ran out of memory. Almost as soon as you stopped the notes magically appeared on the staff lines. You could move individual notes up or down or copy or delete parts with the mouse. It was simple and very useful for a budding singer or songwriter. Its primary limitation was that it could only handle a single instrument. Unfortunately the problems become greater when you add multiple instruments and sound tracks. Even the faster PCs of today choke if you try to add too many parts. So I can sympathise with Finale attempting to track multi instruments and tracks simultaneously. Their higher level product may be more stable, but I found PrintMusic to be a bit glitchy.",1

4689,"My son got these strings for his Schecter Hellraiser guitar. He plays on it a lot!! Mostly metal, alternative and modern rock. I'm not sure if it's the type of music he plays or just that he's used to different strings, but he didn't like these particular strings very much. He kept waiting to break one so that he could replace them. He said that they grab too much as he plays and that they are stiff. He's used to the Ernie Ball Regular Slinky strings. They are bendy and smooth to play on. This does seem to be a durable string and if you are playing songs with defined notes I'd say that they would work well. On the up side, they don't cost a lot to try.",1

It has an led meter to show how much compression it is getting over the signal. I'm never sure this does anything when the knob is below midnight. When its past midnight it has a noticeably squishy sound.  I gave it three stars because for the price its OK. The compressors I really like cost North of $200.

If you are trying to keep it in good shape going back and forth to school, this is not the gig bag for you.  I only need this so that my guitar is safe on car rides from Louisiana and Texas.  There is no real support or extra padding at the bottom of the bag as some have, so if you set your guitar down hard on the end you can hear it reverberate through the whole thing when it bangs against the floor.  It gives you one of those teeth gritting moments! :)

Anyway, if you only need something to make it back and forth on a safe ride, this is the gig bag for you!  If you are planning on hitting the road or take a lot of trips, invest in a more pricier bag!",1

The ES-57 worked fine, but I needed to do quite a bit of post-production work to get my guitar tones where I wanted them to be.  This mic also seems to have higher output than the Shures.  All in all, a great value, as I used them to record two CDs with good result, but the mic is not interchangeable with an SM57.",1

4715,"I wanted to use this for a simple bass guitar pedal board I'm building. Here is what I discovered after putting everything together:
 This unit works great as a power supply. It powers everything on my board really well, and doesn't seem to be adding any noise or taking away any tone.
 This unit DOES NOT work well as a tuner for bass guitar. It would not even track the lowers strings on my 4-string bass at all. So don't even bother trying it with a drop-tuned bass or a 5+ string bass.
 This unit works decently as a tuner for regular 6-string guitar. It tracks all the strings, but it's a bit slower and seems a bit less precise than other tuners.
I ended up not using this on my bass board. My Korg PitchBlack tuner tracks the bass perfectly, and is quicker and seems more precise. So I put that on my bass board, and put this Caline unit on my guitar board. It seems to be working fine there so far and powers everything up really well.",1

They come with attachments that point downward to grab the carpeted surface more securely, but they work better in theory than in practice.  They're probably fine on a flat surface, but now that you know, think about another model if you're going to put them on carpet, unless they'll be way out of the way of anybody bumping into them.",1

This one is the jaw harp equivalent of a $50 violin or those guitar starter pack or a $100 trumpet. With some efforts you can pull something out of them and probably an experienced player can even make them sound decent but it really should resonate more on its own to begin with.",1

I wanted a big shaker for a big sound without having to mic it, but this one is just TOO big with too little material inside for the size. Construction is great, and it will work in a pinch, but the small amount of material inside the shaker makes it a bit of a chore to get a good sound out of it, as you've got to move your arm quite a bit to get a decent sound out of it. The 5-inch version of this is probably a better idea. Worth noting that the material inside this shaker is pretty large and coarse compared to the typical shaker sound I hear so often. I ended up also purchasing one of the Meinl ""double barrel"" type shakers and have had much better luck with that. Different sound for sure, but the mechanics of it are much better for me.",1
4723,This is an okay metronome but it's rather irritatingly loud.  It does have a button that leaves the blinking light on but kills the sound.

If this is something you expect to be using regularly, I recommend saving up and getting something a little more substantial.

4735,"The Tascam US-366 gives you four inputs, but the line RCA outputs can be used as inputs instead, giving a total of six inputs. The unit itself is attractive and solidly built with a robust looking control panel, and very smooth working knobs. Much of the user interface will be on the PC screen, where you have access to the mixer panel. You also have an effects panel that can be used for one of the inputs with a compressor, de-esser, and noise supressor. Switches on the bottom are for one time setup features and let you select whether the digital in is coax or optical, whether the RCA jacks are input or output, and whether to use multi-track mode. The top of the unit has the controls pictured, which include a switch for phantom 48v power, should you need it for your mic. They also include the knobs that for practical purposes you'd want on the hardware, since turning levels down, plugging things in, and setting them appropriately should all be done in the same place, and having the phantom power switch buried in a software screen is potentially more dangerous.

Installation was a bit awkward, and after the drivers were installed, my native audio drivers for my on board audio (latest drivers for my motherboard's audio) blew up. The instructions for the install had me reboot my computer, and when I did, I didn't have much luck after it restarted. The ""interface"" page of the software showed the appropriate values, but they kept blinking on and off. I checked the Windows Playback Devices to see what was listed, and the device kept appearing and disappearing as if I were constantly connecting and disconnecting it. The Windows Device Manager kept refreshing itself so it was impossible to look at any particular device there. I uninstalled the driver, restarted the computer, went to the Tascam website, got the latest drivers, and started again. This time, I don't see the playback device at all.

It seems like a nice device, and I find the layout of the hardware very well thought out. The software (if it worked) seems basic and hopefully as time goes on there will be more features added. But for now, I'll have to call it quits and will try again on a different computer.

With this sort of conflict, it's impossible for me to tell under the circumstances which driver is at fault, and it's entirely possible that the problem lies with the IDT drivers, which are not supplied by Tascam and are not part of the package but are used by my computer. I will update this review when I get a chance to try everything again on a completely different computer system. Unless a lot more reviews appear showing similar problems with the drivers, it's too early to blame Tascam. Unfortunately, the Vine program requires me to put out a timely review, so all I can go by is the look and feel of the hardware (five stars) the look and limited feel of the software, which could be improved, and research I've done indicates that the quality is excellent when it works. Hopefully there will be enough other reviews that this one can be viewed in context.",1
4736,One thing that really separates boutique picks from production line picks is a nice speed bevel (at least for the players who prefer them). The Primetone line is one of the only Dunlop picks to come with a bevel and it's not bad. It's a little too sharp instead of being gradually sloped. This 504 model is VERY small...even smaller than a standard teardrop. The 5mm gauge is super thick...start out with 3mm unless you know what you're dealing with. Bottom line: worth trying out but don't expect anything amazing. Spend the money on boutique picks...they're SO worth it!,1
4737,"I've decided not to use it.  I have a Strat style guitar that needed a new nut.  It fits the slot but needs to be customized for string spacing and action hieght.

The mic works OKAY, and it's definitely better than what I was doing before where I had NO mic and had to rely on my iPhone's built-in input. This mic does allow me to move around while my iPhone is filming, which is nice, while keeping my vocal input fairly level. Of course, that's as you'd expect... having a mic attached to your shirt. However, as I said in the beginning, I need a BIG increase in volume in clarity because I have such a soft voice. This mic just didn't deliver in that regard.",1
4752,Theyre alright I guess. If you're worried about it getting stuck just push it through your trumpet with the snake.

4753,"I am a huge fan of D'Addario/Planet Waves NS Capo products and have several of their capos.  This is the first time that I have encountered their ""lite"" version (thermoplastic which is still .... plastic) and I am not overly impressed.

The capo is the same type as the pro version except they've constructed it out of plastic.  While the capo absolutely works on my guitar all the way up the fretboard, I do not particularly like the feel of plastic.  For <$5 more, you can the NS Guitar Capo Pro made of the aluminum.  It isn't that different in weight and both seem to work as well from the outset ... but the longevity of the plastic version concerns me.  Maybe that is my own hangup.

Given the materials used, I rate this 3 stars.  In the aluminum, 5 stars.  The single-handed 1 screw design makes it easy to maneuver and creates a clean line on any instrument.  Personally, for the money paid for nice instruments and beautiful woods I want my guitar to have the attention ... not a bulky capo.  Design-wise, these are really great.",1

4756,"The cut of these reeds is very good, and when they work, they really work well. From a tone perspective these are pretty hard to beat for the price. The problem is that it seems like it's impossible to get a semi-decent box of these with two good ones and at least a few other usable ones. These aren't as good as they used to be. I hate the way they've individually wrapped each reed - it is a royal pain in the butt to open them, and trust me, there's zero benefit to supposedly ""sealing them at the proper humidity"".

Overall, I think you can get a reed that's just as good as these for less from other manufacturers today. Vandoren must be riding on their reputation right now...they certainly aren't doing anything to stay competitive and sell these things to me. Compared to Vandoren I feel that other companies give me a better box of reeds with a lower percentage of ""duds"" that have a way more consistent strength. Seriously, the most recent box of V12's I opened, I had reeds that felt like they ranged between 3 and 4 in strength. Some were literally unplayably hard and others were so soft that I found myself choking my air stream. Meanwhile I can get a box of D'addario reeds under one of their many premium brands they've launched recently in quarter sizes and they are pretty damn consistent and play way better out of the box by comparison.",1
4757,"While it works and functions well, the inputs/outputs are so...loose and fidgety. I pray everytime I put in my headphones that it won't break. For this price, I really think they should have given me more stable connections. More solid. basically, it feels really cheap and breakable.",1

I'm using an ADK studio condenser microphone on phantom power and the output signal, even when gain is only 50% up, has too much background hiss to be acceptable.  Sure, I could process out the noise in the software but that's also unacceptable.

It may work fine with a dynamic microphone or with a condenser mic on a louder instrument, but for my requirement it is too noisy. I haven't tried it with anything else.

I purchased this to replace a non-USB Behringer mixer that ran out to a Sound Blaster external USB audio interface to my Dell Laptop - a solution that works great, no noise whatsoever!  But this uses several cables, extra power supply, and is lots of trouble to set-up compared to the M-Audio.

The advantage of the M-Audio is it's simplicity:  one cable out to the computer; mic in with phantom power provided; unbalanced instrument input; good headphone output; Stereo line out (RCA), and no power supply required.  If only it were quieter.",1

So i set up a different cabinet with it and stopped the flutter and vibration complaints but I still have trouble finding that vibe for my distorted sound. The amp an all in one combo nice for quick switching to get ideas down. I have the 40 watt version. and it is nice and loud enough for a drum kit and other instruments. There are multiple amp models with a couple metal Peavey amps. It takes a while to get around the over digital perfection of the modeling and find a workable tone. But this thing is made for noodeling and experimenting i9n which at times I have stumbled into some nice tones and sound.
  There are lots of fx and amp voicings  to choose from. I like the reverse reverb and the envelope filter. These are two things that grab you when going through the settings. Yet I do not really use these fx that often and am still struggling to find uses for the other fx whitch seem to always miss the mark.

  This amp would work well fo people on a budget and need an all in one or a nubie who is searching for a sound to get good at. It gives a lot of options for the money and is nice to have around for all the bass guitar, electric and acoustic,, presetting options. However it is not very adjustable with the reverb and delay. these do not have many non pc hook up options. So a lot of times they just do not seem to fit with what I am playing....

Of course I am a bit set in what I like and someone new to amps may find this useful.

 If you want to use the looper at all then be prepared to fork out another 119 dollars for the foot switch. UGH.... They didn't incorporate any non foot switch options....

So again the speaker flutter and vibration due to the terrible design and cheap materials in manufacturing kill this all in one set up from any pro sounding gigs ...
The cabinet just plain sucks... I hope someone lost their job in this fiasco. No, but mayb some bad heartburn for a while?

 So lots of options to try... But few sound great but many are useable the delay and reverb are just hard to work with in that the sound just dosn't do it for me. Definitely try it out at a moderate level( to play with a drummer)l before spending money ... Two an a half stars... ok three....
P.s.  people are always using and playing the amp it is easy to learn and with lots of ways to experiment it gets tracked often in conjunction to other amps for the fill and writing parts. Dosnt mean the tracks will be final but it is a good sketchpad for lots of different people coming and going. Well thats why I bought it.

4769,"Please notE that the above review of this model is in error.  That is really the E-109 and works great.  The wrong picture is being displayed for the E-109 showing the E-108.  Amazon, you should fix that.

The above actual E-108 had a faulty microphone and was noisy internally.  Amazon is kind enough to send me a new one and pay shipping back for the faulty one.  This will be completed within about 2 days - great customer service.  I did get to see the lights move when they should not have and I was still impressed.

I look forward to the new unit arriving in a few days.  I would still recommend this unit.
Remember, the evaluation above this one is for the E-109.  Please change my review to VERY GOOD - RECOMMENDED.",1
4770,"I love Korg tuners but this is not one of their best.  It's accurate enough but it doesn't swivel and thus the direction is limited for mandolin or guitar.

4773,"Don't buy colored or painted trumpets.  The paint starts chipping off really easy, also there is a very slight turpentine sort of smell from the paint I suppose.  I think trumpets are meant to be natural or brass color.  It plays ok but I'm not a real trumpet player, only a beginner.  It comes with a cool bag and hard case, white gloves (really?), a trumpet choke (for the lack of a better word), cleaning fluid, a tuner and a small book.

My only issue is that trumpet metal is maleable.  A little one dropped it on the carpet once or maybe on a hard floor and the bell got slightly bent.  So I had to sort of reshape it with my hands to a sort of perfect circle again.  And in the process there was some more paint chipping as you probably guessed.  Well I shouldn't say paint chip!  It's not so much as dry chipping.  The paint is solid but it just sort of scratches off if you know what I mean.",1
4774,good cheap cord for beginners,1

4778,"As far as fit goes, I used this on a Mexican tele and it fit just fine. When I first saw it, before I took it out of the package, I thought of sending it back. It had all kinds of marks and sloppy folds and cuts. The chrome job was really crummy. It also had a sharp burr, which I had to file. I don't know how it stacks up to other bridges, but it seems a bit thin to me. I don't know how it compares to older originals but I'd bet it's a bit thinner, and I am sure it wouldn't be finished and made so badly. Having said that, I kept it and I am mostly happy with it because, even though the original is much thicker and better made, I just can't jive with the modern style bridge with sound and especially for looks. I googled to see if other people were complaining and another guy put up picks of his bridge and it was worse than mine. He did seem to have gotten a better chrome job however. It will change your tone. It made my tele a bit thinner and lighter sounding, which I like. (After using this for a while I must say I really like the sound much, much better than the original Mexican six-piece bridge. The Mexican plate is much thicker, but it is the thinness of the old style plate that gives it it's real tele sound. The guitar now sounds more like a real old style tele.) I got the compensated brass barrels to go along with this, from WD, which I do like and are well made, and this came out much cheaper than buying a complete bridge setup. I know there are supposed to be some other excellent choices from companies that go from a bit more to a lot more. I wouldn't say don't buy it, but I would suggest looking around more before choosing this one.",1

4780,Sounds great in a distinct way. Scoops out the mids and leaves you with a lot of high sizzle. Fantastic sound if you're a bad singer and you want to hide your voice and cut over loud guitars.

4784,You get what you pay for: The screws on the adapter wear off quickly and then it is impossible to adjust. I had to find a new telescope adapter to use with the stand.

4786,"Okay, for years of music-playing I was mocked for not using these. I switched to them a few years ago and yes, they're good, for strumming. For perfect tonal control, they're not the best. If you're a rhythm guitarist or are playing ska or something and are stuck on Fender poly picks? Make the switch. Take the time to adjust. If you're a metal guitarist, soloing, well... don't. The feedback is inconsistent.

All that said? If you're experienced, hell, you're gonna try everything like me. If you're just starting out, don't believe the hype you may be hearing. Maybe it was my local meta-culture, but I never stopped hearing it. They're good tools for chords. Not good for speed. Too flexible.",1

4793,"This is my second rewrite of this review Jan 3, 2010.  Sometimes a piece of equipment will have a design defect that only becomes a problem in some circumstances.  This headphone amplifier sometimes acts as if it has no input decoupling.  If you are lucky and it likes the output impedance of your DVD player, sound quality will be superb.  Assuming this is the case, the only remaining issue will be whether the output power is adequate.  AKG K 240, and 271 will put out about 98 dB SPL at the clipping point where distortion begins.  Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 80 ohm also work fine. This is loud enough for me, in fact having more power is a danger in my opinion.  Rock fans who like 115 dB SPL will find 98 dB SPL totally lame.  AKG K 240 monitor phones made to the old 600 ohm standard will not be loud enough for anyone.

When this amplifier is connected to certain cable and source impedances, supersonic feedback appears to occur.  As you turn up the volume at some point the volume will drop suddenly.  Others have reported hum or static.  This is a rare problem that I have seen only a few times in 45+ years of messing with electronics.

BOTTOM LINE:  This may work fine, as it does for me when I use it with my Sony DVP-NS55P or cheap Philco DVD player.  It does not work on an LG player which works fine with other amps.  The problem is stable over time,  and whacking it around a bit has no effect at all, so it is not a loose connection inside. Lack of decoupling leads to unpredictable performance.

TECH NOTE:  The theoretical high frequency limit for a CD is 22050 Hz.  For a DVD LPCM audio output the theoretical limit is 24000 Hz, assuming that the LPCM recording is mastered at a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz or higher.  SACD is higher yet.  In practice the upper limit for a CD is about 20,000 Hz,  few people have enough hearing at this frequency to notice any loss of higher frequencies.  AES (Audio Engineering Soc.) ""working group"" calls the CD (when properly recorded) transparent to almost all listeners.  Back in the 1970s David Hafler sold amplifier kits that had an elegant output filter set to 30,000 Hz.  Input circuits were designed to be very stable even when supersonic frequencies from radio and TV stations leaked into the audio input.  A small number of extreme audiophiles found fault with this limited response.  In response, some amplifiers are designed to work at much higher frequencies, resulting in unstable operation.  I for one do not like finding 100 megahertz FM radio signals at an amplifier output.  Decoupling inputs and outputs above 30,000 Hz has never, in my 45+ years of setting up stereo systems, caused a customer to complain.

UPDATE:  May 21, 2013.  I have two units, one has developed a dead spot in the level control leaving three fully functioning headphone outputs.  the second unit is fine.

4794,"Lousy connectors and slightly noisy cables, but overall not bad for the money. Wouldn't use for recording at all.",1
4795,"I have used MANY guitar cables, and I usually try to find good-quality but not too expensive. This was a decent price for what appears to be very good quality. The downside is that it is very stiff and holds it's winding (memory), making it a pain to work with. It catches on things, easy to trip over, etc. Sound-wise it seems fine; I don't notice any difference from my cheaper cables, but I haven't used it for recording where it would be most noticeable. My biggest gripe was the packaging. It comes in a huge, cardboard-and-plastic package that you could fit a garden hose into! What a waste. I wrote to the company with comments, but they did not reply.",1
4796,"I really wish I could love it.  It sounds OK, but is also nasally and dry.  I tried a variety of 12AX7 tubes, but couldn't get one that really clicked with me.  I've tried it with various tube amps, a Fender Deville 410, Hot Rod Deluxe, BandMaster, and Vox AC15.

It's not expensive, so if you're thinking about buying it, go a head.  It certainly provides a nice crunch and the built in noise gate is a nice addition.  But for its size there are better pedals, such as the DigiTech Bad Monkey.",1
4797,"This winds up much nicer then my plastic jump dunlop which tends to flop around on the tuning pegs, this one does not flow around and you don't hit the wood which is nice. However, the part that trims the wires doesn't lock into an open position or rather it doesn't have a stopper and if you are changing strings all by yourself and don't have a workshop with stuff to hold the headstock for you while you do stuff, your going to really only have 1 hand to cut the strings with because your using the other to hold the guitar or move a stray wire out of the way if you happen to have more then one. If this had a spring and stopper it would be MUCH easier to use. So the cutter is a big of a pain and consider its 50% of this tool it should have been made a bit more functional. I should not need two hands on the tool to cut the wire.",1

4800,"+ Feel of keys: 4/4 for a keyboard in this price range; my favorite thing about this unit.

+ Aftertouch sensitivity: better than Roland, but still hard to control smoothly.

+ Arpeggiator: this is a well-implemented feature EXCEPT that there's no latch button. I assumed, because Novation has been making various keyboards for several years, that it would have this basic feature but, no.

+ Faders: felt a tiny bit gritty and -- what was more frustrating -- they would spontaneously wake up and broadcast whatever value they were last set to. This didn't happen all the time, by any means, but it happened at least once every time I used this keyboard. I worried that it would get worse over time.

+ Knobs: I'm afraid these are as bad as everyone says. Mine were accurate and didn't twitch like the faders, but they are loose and wobbly. The knobs and faders on the Roland equivalent (A-500PRO) are smoother and give you a feeling of precise control.

+ Programmability: I gather that most people want these to control soft synths on their computers. I bought it, though, to control a couple of hardware synths via MIDI. The faders were fine for sending CC values; I used them to adjust amp and filter envelopes. The knobs could be programmed for CC values, but the NRPN implementation is poor. If you're buying this to get more knobs for a synth that primarily uses NRPN, don't; unless Novation updates the firmware, it's really not set up for that. Even sending CC values, the knobs were frustrating. These are endless encoders so, turning clockwise, the knob should increase the value from its current position, not from the absolute minimum value. Other keyboards, including the Novation SL series, can increment and decrement CC values, but not this one apparently. This makes it useless for adjusting a sound during a live performance, while you are actually playing. Unless your current value happens to be the absolute minimum, you and your audience will hear a jump.

+ Support: if you're in the UK you can call Novation on the phone. I'm not in the UK, so I emailed support with my questions. One question was answered in three days (we're sorry and that's a good idea, but it can't do this currently). Slow, but polite. When I had more serious questions (what's going on with these twitchy faders, how can I program the knobs to adjust values smoothly?), I waited one week and received no answer, beyond the automated ""We'll get to you shortly"" message.

Then I returned the controller. I'm honestly not sure what to recommend in its place. The Roland A-500PRO is more compact, has keys that feel just as responsive, and has better knobs and faders. But it can't be fully programmed without a computer, its aftertouch is stiff, and the mod stick is spring-loaded so that it returns to zero when you release it. (There are workarounds, but this is still a minus for me.) The other obvious alternative is the Akai MPK49, which I haven't tried.",1
4801,"Works well for wall wash application, but not for stage lighting.  While I was impressed they came with instructions, the instructions did not include the settings and the color that the manuals setting would provide.  It is a guessing game - and I'm not into that too much.  Good housing, nice hardware with the unit - a larger knurled knob to tighten the light to the bracket would be nice - would allow for tool free repositioning.  Will I keep them? YES.  I'll just be using them for curtain wash applications.",1
4802,"Behringer makes a slew of pedals, from terrific to mediocre. This one falls somewhere in between. It has a number of interesting effects that more or less simulate a Leslie speaker sound, and some variations, but it has a light that flashes when it is on that is very annoying. This changes from red to blue depending on whether you've chosen slow or fast speed. You can't turn this off. It will constantly flash, even when you're not using the pedal. It's quite distracting, and if you cover it up with tape or something, you won't be able to see when it's on or off. That alone is enough to turn me off from this unit.

The other annoying feature is that although you can change from slow to fast while playing without having to stop and change a setting, this requires a 2 second holding down of the pedal. That wasn't quite the issue with me, as I usually just use a single setting for most songs and only occasionally adjust it to something different, but that, combined with the fact that the flashes change from ""mostly red"" to ""mostly blue"" also means you have to pay more attention to this pedal instead of concentrating on your playing. The Behringer Vibrato pedal doesn't do quite the same thing, but I much prefer it because it has no issues, unlike this one.",1
4803,"After looking back at other options after I bought this, it is a great idea, but not the most efficient design. It sounds great up close, and works for beginners in audio recording like myself, but I wish I bought something a little more practical with the money I had.",1

With this product and I would think it was working only to find that the output was only set lower. When compared with the same output I could see no difference. Make sure you buy from a reputable dealer so that if it does not work for you, you can return it.",1
4809,"It does come with most everything you need to make the drum.

Assembly was fairly quick and straight forward.

The tough part was sanding the pieces together.

I used a belt sander and an orbital sander for that. It still took 30 minutes to do with power tools. I don't know how long it would have taken with the enclosed sanding blocks!

The snares seem a bit flimsy, but I can get new ones from the drum store.

I thin I'd order the $59 Ovanongol (sp) kit instead if I had the means to glue the pieces together.",1

4821,"I use Elixir 80/20 bronze strings on most of my acoustic guitars, but I'm not a fan of the phosphor bronze variety. To my ear, the PBs sound thin and ""shooshy,"" for lack of a better word. The thin tone is even more apparent through a piezo pickup.

I realize that tone is subjective, but I tried Elixir PBs on two very different guitars (small-body 000 and big ol' dreadnaught), and I didn't care for their sound on either instrument. However, Elixir 80/20s sound great on those same guitars.

Your mileage my vary, but I've spent a lot of years (and money) trying to get good natural and amplified acoustic guitar tone. Strings are a big part of that equation, and for me Elixir phosphor bronze strings didn't cut it.",1
4822,I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.,1
4823,"It sounds like it's Behringer.  Very fake, cheap sounding phaser, but it's all I need.  I got it mostly for that big airplane woosh, and running it in the loop, it does that fine.  The highs are kind of harsh, but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame.",1
4824,Does the job,1
4825,"I've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised.  I don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there.  To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic.  Well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack.  It doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine.

THey fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some ""sparkle"".  But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable.  The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to.

The bottom line:  I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't really see them becoming my go-to picks.  I like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations.  I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers.  Worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright.  You know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up.",1
4826,good for the price,1
4827,They say this model is too bass heavy and therefore inaccurate than their lower numbered models and it sounded pretty true for me. The bass is heavier yet trebles were also abit too sharp for my liking and the deal breaker was the fitting on the head for me.

That's too bad because we both like my Cordoba Concert uke which uses the same tuners.

I tired unplugging everything and setting it back up but that end result was worse all I heard was noise and I tried 3 different guitars. When it was working It was fine(that is why 3 stars instead of 1), not noisy at all (i have a noiseless board with a one spot so...)It's to late to return this so I don't know what I will do with this.

Update- after waiting a total of five months I contacted them via their facebook page and was asked to email them again. After exchanging a few emails they told me that they couldn't do anything and to contact the seller. I told them the return/exchange window has closed, so there was nothing the seller could do for me. Then they told me to "" try and negotiate with the seller to see what they can do for me"".

4843,"Sounds great without any overdrive or distortion pedals. Once you add those, it had a subtle, weird high pitched tail end when soloing. I returned it, just didn't work for me.",1
4844,"Would love to give it 5 star because it works great, but it looks like it got ran over before it made it to my mailbox",1
4845,"I've heard lots of metal players review these and say that they helped with their speed. They're smaller than average plectrums.  I tried hard to get used to them but just couldn't.  Different pick strokes for different pickin' folks, I guess.  I don't care for them very much.  They're built with typical Dunlop quality (excellence).  They're good for what they are and I'm sure some players will still really dig them.",1
4846,Picks up the guitar vibrations good but doesn't seem to tune exactly ever time time. May be my user's error... just seems like the tuning isn't super tight.,1
4847,"The hanger itself is excellent, so far. The screws, and especially the drywall anchors included are a complete joke. If you value your instrument, drop them off in the nearest trash can and use real screws and anchors from the hardware store. I'd have given this hanger a higher star rating, but given the critical nature of it's attachment to the wall, these anchors and screws seem like very a risky choice given the potential value of what may be hanging from this thing.",1
4848,good enough for the price,1
4849,"I'm not going to recommend this over the $15 capos. It's better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made. I decided to try this one out, but the construction of it makes it feel like it's going to break if I pull it too hard. And, because of that, it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove. But, once it's on, it works.",1
4850,"For some reason I thought these would be thinner. It is a fairly stout piece of wood. I'm generally more of a light to medium weight pick guy but wanted to see these and see how they felt. Comfortable to hold. There is really no ""give"" at all in the pick though, it is a solid piece of wood. When used on my classical and an old 12-string the pick does produce a nice, mellow sound. Great addition to my pick collection though, but don't think I will use it much.",1
4851,"I am using this pedal on my Peavey Classic 50 410 combo amp. The pedal states it is for this amp, but the buttons are reversed? The reverb button switches the channel and the channel button turns the reverb on and off? A little lack of quality control I'd say. I can use it, but it's not right?",1
4852,"These strings sounded great, but after a while some of the coating started wearing off and a weird green substance was on the strings.  They still sounded good, but it was weird.  They were a little overpriced, though. I'm currently using DR RARE's.  Half the price and the sound is better (in my opinion).  The DRs also feel alot nicer on the fingers.",1
4853,A little confusing too much going on.,1
4854,Good,1
4855,It is okay.  I keep a humidity guage in my guitar cases as well and these do not seem to put nearly as much moisture into the case as other humidifiers I've had.  That could be due to the very small size of the moisture holding sponge inside this unit.,1
4856,"Nice and very useful gadget but the construction is weak. It is made of cheap plastic and would easily break. Well, I still need it so I will keep it and handle it carefully like an Egg.",1
4857,"I've used this color strip for several college parties, and I'm pleased to report that it has generally been successful in providing a cool edge and nice ambiance to the parties. However, here are the details:

(1) Great for small/medium parties... and nothing else.
If you're using it for a party held in a living room, basement, garage, dorm commons room, etc., this thing can power it up by itself, though you might want to add a small light on the side. I've even used this to light up a floor on a rooftop party. However, any bigger room/hall, and you'd need to join it with bigger artillery. At the very least, if you're a DJ, you could use it to light up your DJ booth for a nice effect. If your party is drawing more than 60-70 people, it won't be enough on its own.

(2) Quality is OK.
After easy/moderate use of this product, I noticed that the blue light would give an awkward flicker every now and then. I personally take this to be a shortcoming of the product, and after taking very good care of the color strip, I wonder if this flickering is indication of poor quality. As you use the product at any given time, though, the flickering goes away- it's mostly present while the color strip warms up. It doesn't look normal to me.

(3) Controls are a bit tiring.
One of the controls adjusts the sensitivity of the sound sensors; that is, if the sensor hears a house beat going at 130 bpm, it will flash the lights accordingly, at 130 bpm. If you adjust the control at very high sensitivity, the lights will alternate at ANY bit of sound- thus, the lights will flash rapidly regardless of the beat. So why is this an issue? If you have two songs playing at slightly different volume/decibel level, you'd need to constantly change the sensitivity of the color strip. I hope that Chauvet will fix this problem in their future products.

(4) For the money, it's good.
It's selling around $70, which is pretty affordable for a color strip. The LEDs are very nice and shine brightly, but this piece won't light up a very big dance floor. For medium to small events, this is a great addition to your light rig- as long as you take very good care of it.",1
4858,"I really don't like to use products like these because, 1. if you use them you loose dexterity because the tips stick to the string and you have less feeling in your fingers
2. because if you are a beginner you want to build callouses so you won't have to use these.
after saying that, I still ordered these because I had to, i had developed blisters (the nasty painful ones with air and pus), i needed something to protect my fingers. This did a good job of that but they kind of slip off your fingers if you play too hard. Moral of the story, don't get these unless you really have to. Your better off getting some light blisters and growing scar tissue over it. A tip for those who already own these, putting baby powder on the outsides help it be less sticky.",1
4859,The product is good. I use it to store and carry my guitar around. It's useful for what I need which is just something to carry a guitar in. I've had it for about a month and no problems. There is a little bit of room in the bag when the guitar is in it so I try not to bang the bag around too much. Doesn't have much cushioning either.,1
4860,"Well, it's plastic...",1
4861,This item use to be really of a strong built but now it kind of weak.  I wish they lower the price even more.,1
4862,"Pushing a microphone out of the way when I'm not using it is very useful, having the cable built into the arm means less mess for me to deal with. this is a good basic boom microphone holder. It has reasonable reach and doesn't make a lot of noise when you move it around.",1
4863,"It works as it should but the right angle ends stick out way too much. So my pedals have to be separated more. In other words, these cables aren't a very good space saver on your pedal board",1
4864,This Item make from China never fix with MXL MT-001,1
4865,"Bought these to compare to what I have always used (Super Slinkys) and have to say I wasn't impressed. I tried three sets on three different guitars and all three sounded much more thin and tinny than I expected. They also did not seem to last nearly as long and the SS strings. Lesson learned-if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",1
4866,Worked for about a week the the weight of the guitar pulled the sheetrock anchor out of the wall and left a huge hole now. It needs to come with better anchors.,1
4867,"I bought this to replace my aging M-Audio 25-key Oxygen. It is smaller than expected: it reminds me of those small Casio keyboards of the 80s. Anyway, it has saved me so much desktop space. I love the size. It's great for what I do (write bass and lead lines, close voiced chords). I'm not a fan of the joystick mod/pitch wheel but I can get over that. What I can't get over is ... it isn't mapped for Reason! The pads are not mapped correctly for Kong. Heck, Reason didn't even auto detect it. And, according to Akai's support, they have no plans on doing so. Instead, they put the ball in Propellerheads' court. It will likely not be resolved and will require instead on user hacks. Because of this I'm returning mine.

I'm disappointed. I shouldn't have to hack the editing software to get it to work with the industry leader in electronic music production.",1
4868,"It was good delivery, the product works well, but came sealed bag but without a set of strings. That is, I only got 9 sets of strings. I paid 10 and got 9. So no good.",1
4869,"They are decent quality.  It's hard to tell from the pictures online, but the skulls are just painted on the top.  That makes them look sort of cheap up close.  If the skulls were inside the resin of the knobs I would have given them five stars - just a more refined look.",1
4870,"I have a Sigma DR-7, which is a Martin authorized guitar similar to a D28 full size dreadnought.  The strap is too short when set to its' longest length to be worn anywhere except fairly high on the chest.  Also, the leather is thin, has little cushion, and appears cheaply made. (Time will tell)",1
4871,Well I guess it works? I don't know what I was expecting. I was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar. I had to tie the other end around the guitar area but I don't know I guess it is okay it doesn't really bother me it is just that I wasn't expecting it. Also the actual band where I can put around my body is not THAT comfortable but it is okay and I can move around in it and secure it to my body.,1

4875,"This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes. But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume. The pickup is very, over sensitive.

Also, spend some time where exactly you place the pickup, it makes a big difference! Try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something.",1

4880,"Purchasing Hohner Echo Celeste Harmonicas has been a ""hit and miss"" experience for me.  Several weeks ago, I ordered one in the key of D.  I needed to adjust a few of the reeds toward the middle of the harmonica.  However, I recently ordered one in the key of F.  It was a disaster!!  The seals on both sides of the box were broken.  The instrument is barely operable, and I will definitely be returning it.  This may mean that someone opened the box in transit and damaged the instrument.  But I think a better explanation is that someone working for Amazon sent me a ""dud"" instrument that was rejected by another buyer.  If the latter is the case, shame on the company!!  If you can get an Echo Celeste that is properly tuned--in other words, the reeds are properly positioned--you will be very pleased.  This instrument has a very warm and beautiful sound.  I use tremolos to play folk music and church hymns.  They are great for Christmas music and playing national anthems.  I most recently learned the Soviet Union's national anthem, which sounds great on my Echo Celeste in the key of D.  Good luck finding one that does not need any work!!",1
4881,"Affordable, but the zipper broke after 1 year",1

4885,"Well, I love that it's lightweight and foldable, so it fits in my gig bag very nicely. Was not in love with the fact that the little nut that holds the sliding part in place stripped out after the SECOND use. It wasn't really necessary anyways, so I didn't return it. Other than that it has worked fine. A great alternative to the big bulky thing I used to drag around.",1
4886,"Sounds great, when there is no crackle! Crackles more then it doesn't.",1

I have left it open around a music stand for a few weeks and still waiting for the spring to weaken enough to use it. I hope this is an isolated occurrence and not a new trend. Once I get it weak enough I am sure it will work as great as my previous ones.

Will update when I get another one.",1
4890,"It does what it's supposed to, I guess. It tightens/loosens strings, clips strings, and pulls pegs. It's also a good price. My only concern is that it feels like it's going to disintegrate in my hand, making me think that I should probably have just spend a little more money and used the other wire cutters I already have in my toolbox.",1
4891,"Updated my review to change from 4 stars to 3 stars, because after 6 months, the lights are almost completely dim. (I've only used the power cord, but I just now got the same result using batteries)",1

4893,"Update: I've had a this capo a couple months now and have a bit different viewpoint now. I've downgraded it from 4 stars to three. I've since returned to mainly using my Shubb capo for a couple reasons. Compared to the Shubb this capo seems to darken or dull the tone of my acoustics a bit. Also, if not set exactly properly I get some buzzing that I don't get with the Shubb.  I think part of the reason is that the rubber on the Shubb is harder and seem to set the strings against the frets firmer without excess pressure needed. I find that I have to  ""set"" the A&E capo with more care, sometimes needing to press it together and sometimes needing to set is on a bit of a diagonal and not straight across.  Still it is a decent capo, very convenient... but still needing a few refinements.
..................................................................................................

Just received this capo today. I've previously been using a Schubb Deluxe capo and have been pretty happy with it as far as playing goes, but putting it on the guitar can require two hands, is a bit slow and you cannot store it on your guitar while not in use like the Keyser style capos.

This capo is pretty decent. As others have noted it has adequate spring strength to depress the strings without bending them out of tune. However, I did find the sharp corners on the fret side of the capo quite annoying. For example, when capo is on the 5th fret if I finger an Em with 2&3 the corner of the capo would poke the knuckle at the base of my index finger. Without moving the capo much higher on the fret I did the only logical thing and filed down the corners, rounding and polishing them.

Though another minor detail, I didn't think I'd be so aware of a rear facing handle, but I suppose it's easier to install than having to reach all the way across the neck to put a capo on.  Would I buy it again? Possibly. It's inexpensive and works but could use some further refinements.",1
4894,I just pulled it out of the box and was surprised at how flimsy the product is. I'll hold on to it and see how it holds up.,1
4895,Does good but not worth the money.,1
4896,"Because the sounds are not so bad. And the price is amazingly cheap.

But the hiss is just too much. If you try to play at high volume it is unbearable.

Ona side note, It is plastic but it seems sturdy. It's a pain to change the battery.
It's very hard to get a clean sound.",1
4897,"More gain and uncolored reproduction than a Shure 87a, at 1/4th the price.  Feeds back easily.  Not for use on an enclosed stage.  Need an open stage.  Cannot get closer than 4-5 inches away with my mouth, or the sound gets weird.  Can't remember exactly what it did.

Used 3-4 times, and then it died after 3 months.  Amazon said to ship it back for replacement.

Good for what it is, if the next one is more durable.",1
4898,Some of the strings were already corroded when I open the package.  Cleaned with extra fine sandpaper and they were okay.,1
4899,"The letter displayed seems to have issues with which note we're actually dealing with, although it does seem to be handling the tuning aspect ok. Just takes a few seconds to make the decision to change the note on the screen.
Good luck finding enough space on a 3 per side headstock....",1
4900,"Extra light just isn't for me. These strings sound a bit tinny and wear down extremely fast, leaving them looking dirty very quickly. Though the sound is bright, it lacks a certain resonance that higher gauge strings tend to have. I was trying these out, just to see how they were, and while I'm sure they'd work well for some people, it just wasn't going to fly on my guitar

Pros:
- Nice packaging
- Bright sound

Cons:
- Don't last long
- Wears quickly
- Snaps under high tensions, be sure to adjust your tress rod before use.

All in all, they're okay, just not for me.",1

They were different than what the other guitarist in my band had and they were easy to identify that it was mine if it was on a stage or the ground. Then I noticed that the graphic begun to wear off after normal and not necessarily hard picking. I love Fender! They are my favorite brand and that's why I got these. I loved the color and the logo brightly and confidently printed on the front. So when the graphic basically disintegrated, I was left with cheep plastic. Not thrilled.",1

Besides that this is an OK hanger but like I said don't hang anything that has a lot of weight on it or you might be sorry!",1
4906,"I bought a pair of these just over a year ago, at first they worked just fine then I started getting static when adjusting the Volume control to the point where the Main speaker was not playing but the other one was. Having bought then outside of the US it was very difficult to get the warranty honored so I decided to fix them myself as I am a technician. What I discovered was the volume controller which is also the Power switch was defective, and I could not get a replacement. so what I did was replace the volume control with another one and and added a power switch. Now it works like a charm.",1

Sure, my equipment is not exactly high-end, but I must say I had maybe expected a bigger difference to the sound -- that warm tube sound that everybody is talking about, and I can't say it made a big difference on my setup. Perhaps the preamps in the mixer and in the recorder are not to bad after all... It may be more useful as a direct box if you need it. It is also very noisy, with a lot of hiss if you turn up the gain a little. On the positive side, it looks very nice and seems well built, although the LED-lit vacuum tube is gimmicky and makes me wonder if the tube is really operating at all.

They only problem I have with these picks is that they start to break apart after some extended use, even before the pick's tip starts to naturally wear off. They tend to break at the tip point and exactly at the border between the different camouflage colored plastics. So while playing you might suddenly end up with a pick that has a large chip broken off at the tip section. It happened to me already several times and is very annoying. I seem to have this problem the most with these lighter gauge picks and not with the heavier ones from the same brand.

They bowed the neck a bit, which I readily resolved with the truss rod, but they sounded rather dull and flat to my ears, nothing like what a Telecaster should sound like.

In addition to running the acoustic guitar through the Vocalist 3, I also mic it with a Beta 57.  Blending the two seems to give me a fuller, and more natural sound.  If you're only running guitar direct, maybe the clicking noises wouldn't get picked-up as much.  The 3rd & 5th harmonies are pretty good...the 7th's, and octaves, not so much.  The higher ones better than the lower ones, at least for my already deep voice.  The pitch correction is OK I suppose if used at 50% or less.  It's not really gonna create any magic for you anyway, but it will smooth things a bit...and won't sound over processed if you keep below that 50%.  The gender bender doesn't work well, again at least for my voice.

If it wasn't for those footswitches, I'd give it 5...and keep this processor.

They are very responsive and very professional with dealing with issues with their product.

Customer service plays a big part with products I buy especially online, and KLIQ Music Gear's is top notch.

I mainly rely on (verified purchase) customer reviews, hence I am updating this review for others to see.

====================
I bought this tuner mainly for my daughter's violin, for the chromatic tuning. The problem is, it displays the ""flat"" version of notes, example, if you try for F#, ir displays Gflat, for C#, it displays Dflat etc.  For a child training on her violin, to see if her finger is in the right place it can get confusing.

Another emphasis on this tuner is the bright colorful display, what is not mentioned is, it has to be at the correct angle to be seen properly especially the ""NOTE"" as it is in white and is very thin.

The control is also in a cumbersome position when you change settings ( I have my tuners mounted on the left side of the scroll).

The tuner that came with my daughter's Kennedy Violin is a lot better.

====================

I can think of 3 improvements for this tuner to make it the best:
1. Make the yellow and red indicators thinner to make way for a bigger and thicker ""Note"" (letter), and if possible, make it light up green  too.
2. Move the selector swtiches to the top
3. Make a selection switch for flat (b) and sharp (#) display",1

4987,"I bought this to use as a selector/combiner to route multiple instruments to a single amp. ABC Selector/Combiner is its name, right? It does not do it. It only works as a single channel selector, because whatever instrument has the strongest signal overpowers the others so their signal doesn't get through. For instance, say I've got my guitar, keyboard, and mic plugged into the A, B, and C spots. My guitar sucks up all the signal, and you can't hear the keys or the mic. I have to turn off channel A, and then I can hear either the mic or the keys, depending on how I have their volumes set. So it's really only good for ONE channel at a time. If you have three instruments with equal signal output strength (good luck!) AND you want them to play through the amp at equal sound (which would be never!) THEN it combines. What I needed instead was an unpowered mixer, like the Behringer Micromix , which has volume pots on the channels, so that you can turn the various channels up or down individually.

We knew going into it that the sticks were not the highest quality and they would break.  However, it is really nice to be able to give a pair of sticks to a student and not care if they brake.  I would not recommend these sticks to a drum set player because they are really thick sticks and they had a little bit of a slick coating on them.  So again, they would work well for a percussion ensemble with some young players, or front ensemble players that are using things like buckets, trash cans etc.",1

5000,I've purchased 2 pairs of these sticks and the rubber/anti-vibe in one of the sticks popped out.  I sent for a replacement for the first pair and didn't bother with the 2nd pair.

5001,"This is the stock replacement for the Peavey Classic 30 amp. I was reading options for a reverb improvement for my amp and found that the Accutronics 9EB2C1B (MOD also makes this upgraded version) was a suitable 3 spring upgrade to the stock 2 spring unit. Although this stock reverb sounded OK and worked fine, the 3 spring version sounds so much better! I am happy that I spent the $8 - $10 more on the 9EB2C1B.

I was able to install my new 9EB2C1B in a matter of 10 minutes with a phillips screwdriver. First I pulled out the tubes so they would not get in the way. I noticed the stock reverb unit was not screwed directly into the base of the amp. The 2 screws only went through the black bag holding the reverb unit down. Once I had the reverb out of the bag (along with the piece of cardboard that was under the stock reverb), I pulled out the 2 RCA jacks, plugged them into the new unit, dropped it back into the bag, with the stock cardboard piece, and then screwed the bag back into the bottom of the amp. That was it... not difficult at all.

So although I think the stock reverb sounds OK, I personally prefer the buttery rich and smooth vibrating tones that are produced by the 3 spring 9EB2C1B. I also upgraded my stock tubes to JJ tubes at the same time and WOW... this is like a totally different and stronger amp.

It is slightly better than my stock Taiwan DS-1, however the difference takes substantial attention to discern the difference.  Sounds closer to that stock DS-1 than my Keeley modded DS-1 to me, however I appreciate the increased tonal range and attention to detail.  It will NOT get you a Satriani tone with just any amp, or at least not without careful adjusting.  Through the clean channels of my Marshall JVM410H and my Carvin X-100B it has more 'hair' and not as smooth as Satch's tone.  I dial down the grit from his setting and find a happy medium with my Marshall gain and a Neunaber reverb pedal plus delay in the effects loop.",1

The bad:

The built-in, too-short Lightning cable was a HUGE misstep. If you want to use Korg Gadget, you have no choice but to place the Lightning connector under the iPad. Because the area beneath the iPad is quite shallow, the iPad ends up being propped up by the connector, not the groove in the StudioConnect. Worse, the connector's built in, so there's nothing you can do about it! Maddeningly stupid design -- I can't imagine what they were thinking.",1

Considering it has 1.5 octaves lower than a soprano uke, and only .5 octave higher than the guitar, the body size should have been closer to a guitar size and not half way between a guitar and a uke.  As such, the frequencies do not show themselves.  A uke is great because it is simple and small and perfect for the high frequencies it is meant to play.  Use this as a easy to carry and play guitar, but do not expect the high ring cute sound of a uke or the openness and bass tones of a real guitar.",1
5023,"Okay, but wobbles with weight of DJ case. Good idea but needs to be made with thicker material, and different locking devise, loose fitting.",1
5024,It works well but only fits my corded mic.  Cordless will require an additional adapter.,1
5025,It did not solve the rf problem on the Mackie 1402VLZ that was demodulating a nearby AM radio station.  I believe this filter would have helped if the rf were only common mode and if the mixer did not have a pin 1 problem.  I ended up switching from dynamic mics to CAD C195's.  These powered mics allowed the trim to be lowered 20dB where the rf pickup does not cause a problem.,1
5026,ok,1
5027,"It depends on what units you use for setup.  If you use metric or decimal inches, it's probably pretty decent.  But, I tend to use 64ths for string heights and there is only one tiny area that has 64ths you can use.  It is probably the smallest bit on the ruler.  The best string setup helpers are the little boxes along the edge and they are either metric or decimal 40ths of an inch 0.025 increments.  I've converted the numbers and can use the thing, but will probably get a different one in the end because I'm old and set in my ways.  I can see it being decent if you setup metric.  As it is, it's worse than the small rule I was using because the 64ths markings are a little smaller.",1
5028,"This was airmailed from China. It arrived nine days after I ordered it, so no complaints there. The box was a bit dinged up but it was lined with 3/8"" thick slabs of styrofoam (with a big plastic bag to protect the instrument, as styrofoam tends to weld onto things) and the ukulele was undamaged.

This instrument is very well built. The wood is quite interesting, one of the acacia species, though I have no idea if it's African or Australian acacia. The back is a three-layer plywood, with a bookmatched acacia veneer face which shows some interesting stripes. The peghead face is also acacia veneer with stripes and a bit of flame figure. The top seems to be made of bookmatched solid lumber, with mild figure but prominent chatoyance - the effect in some woods which makes them look dark or light as your viewing angle changes slightly. The sides are two pieces (not bookmatched), again showing interesting stripes and some flame figure. The neck looks like the same wood, but built up of two planks, like just about all other ukes nowadays; the two planks are not well match visually, so are obviously two separate glued planks. The tuners are standard open geared cheapies; I've bought sets of identical tuners for about eight dollars (I like to keep an assortment around in case any fail on my guitars, ukes, banjos or mandolins). Though inexpensive they work reasonably well; one of the knobs on this instrument is slightly loose, which is mildly annoying but doesn't interfere with its function.

An Aquila label was stuck through the strings, but, oddly enough, it was for SuperNylgut strings, rather than the usual New Nylguts which most of us mean when we order Aquilas. So far as I can tell they're soprano strings, intended by the manufacturer for soprano ukes tuned high g-C-E-A. SuperNylgut high G soprano strings are Aquila number 100U; New Nylguts would be number 4U.

The fretboard is, as usual on ukes, flat, and looks like some sort of rosewood, of no striking appearance. The fret finish is excellent, with no trace of sharp edges anywhere ... though that may change during the winter in North America, when indoor humidity is low and all our fretboards shrink slightly and leave our fret ends protruding.

Note a peculiarity - the pearloid-esque position dots for frets 5, 7, 10, and 12 are not quite as shown in the photo; rather than two dots at the 12th fret - a conventional and very sensible arrangement - mine has two at the 7th fret, and only one at the 12th. I have no idea why.

The little carved leaf or vine pattern around the sound hole looks to be burned in by laser. The ""Caramel"" script on the headstock looks carved, though I'm sure it's laser engraved as well.

So, how does she sound?

Very muted. Perhaps it's just hard to get much sound out of this tiny body, or maybe the soundboard is too thick, but whatever the cause, you certainly won't annoy the neighbors playing this. Hell, you won't even annoy them if they're in the same room. I don't have another sopranino for comparison, but even my cheapest plywood soprano uke is a sonic powerhouse compared to this little guy.

When tuned to standard uke g-C-E-A the strings are undertensioned and don't sound good. Tuned up two half steps, to a-D-F#-B, they sound much better.

Setup is poor, perhaps the worst of any new ukulele I've bought recently. The action is much too high at both the nut and the bridge. Perhaps because of this, intonation is poor. On all four stings, notes at the twelfth fret are very sharp. The tailpiece is so high that I'm afraid major surgery might be needed to lower the bridge; I don't think that just sanding the piece of bone down there a bit thinner will lower it enough.

So, all-in-all, a mixed bag. With only slightly more effort the manufacturer could have made a far better instrument - really, it costs no more to make a bridge the right thickness than it does to make it the wrong one - but the price is very aggressive and I can't say I didn't get my money's worth. I've bought or inherited ukuleles which were essentially unplayable - genuinely shabby workmanship, ghastly intonation at all frets, mysterious dead spots all over the fretboard - and this certainly isn't one of those. It really doesn't sound bad; it just doesn't sound as good as it might. And it certainly is cute.",1

5032,"As a stand alone, ie. w/o the separate stand attached, the practice pad works great. That being said, the stand that came with the pad is just OK until you get to the attachment from the stand to the actual pad. The pivot point is very unreliable and I would say not very well thought out. It doesn't seem to tighten down firmly, so there is a looseness to it and it wobbles. I just set the pad on my coffee table, I will probably use the stand for something else if I can figure out how to make the pivot point more user friendly.",1

5036,"Hi, I just wanted to add the helpful note that these brackets will only work for the newer line of Pedaltrain pedal boards. I have a Pedaltrain PT-2 (which is not the same as the Pedaltrain Classic 2), with the two ""port holes"" in the back (vs. being just open in the back between the two bars), and this made the Voodoo Labs Pedal Power 2+ hang too low, below the lowest point of the underside of the board.

The correct brackets to purchase for a Pedaltrain PT-2 (and others) are the ""Pedaltrain BRKT-1 Mounting Bracket for Voodoo Lab - PT-JR, PT-1, and PT-2,"" which I found on a different website.",1

I tried plugging it in to different sources, and still got nothing. I plugged the Shure back in, and everything was working again.

I would not rate this product lower than a three out of five because when it is functioning, it does sound good. I've listened to the audio through videos I've seen online and it clearly works with others just fine.

Long story short, I recommend getting this mic through Amazon Prime so if it does not function, you can easily return it.",1

5041,"My review is based on string size too. The strings sounded good but when I play in the higher notes they dropped off in guitar singing power. High notes just don't have as much volume? Also the strings are to slippery and my fingers slide off the strings when I try to hold them down. (more finger pain)  These are custom lights. I recommend regular lights. You can apply more power and volume to them thus making the guitar sing better. I'd say for a quiet area the custom lights and experienced fingers would sound awesome. I like to be able to play hard and loud when I need to.  If you want a softer touch. easier bend,  custom light is for you.",1
5042,"My regular small amp is a old AC15 from the 60s. I took it to my tech for a cap job & new tubes. Since it would be several weeks till I would get it back he gave me a AC15VR as a loaner. If you are considering one of these as a lower priced AC 15 you will be disappointed. It sounds like the real thing in the way the AC 15 models do on any of Vox's Valvetronics modeling amps. Similar but no cigar. One of the outstanding features on the real, even the more recent Korg versions, is the amazing spring reverb. How somebody could have thought this digital disaster could have been a reasonable substitute is beyond me. The other big letdown is the volume. While on paper they are both 15 watts, the real thing sounds twice as loud. I tried out a ac30vr and it sounds about as loud as my regular AC15. On its own it isn't very gigworthy. Overall it sounds like a Valvetronics amp stuck into the AC 15 model. If you can't afford a new AC15 I would suggest searching out a used one, even a more recent Korg all tube version,  for around what a new ac15vr costs. I was so happy when I returned the loaner & got my baby back. I would only recommend the VR to somebody who has not used the real thing",1
5043,"BOTTOM LINE: The Orange Micro Terror is powerful hybrid amp head capable of driving any number of speakers you throw at it. It's low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your hand.

WHY ONLY 3 STARS? For starters, this is what I would consider a ""novelty-boutique amplifier"", because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss, but it's lack of clean headroom is evident. It's an Orange after all, and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1-channel to work with - this head is for you. Playing with a Les Paul, I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing. I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30. I was able to find the ""sweet spot"" on the Tone knob, which for me was around 1 o'clock, and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max... I had entered a very musical, lush, and totally gig-worthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with. However, as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we're starting at 5 stars) I have to subtract one star. I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesn't exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise, which leads to feedback. I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if you're in a rock band, already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and want something quick and small to use to rock out with. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse. This leads me to my final point: if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple (but GREAT) one.

WHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal. Having owned several different combo amps and head/cabinet variations over the years, the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I were starting over from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed. This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert stage venues.

(TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL: I've noticed this review, and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes. It seems like, people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the caveat of ""but it's $150, what do you expect?"" or they begin their rave review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I don't judge gear just by price, I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing. If you're dropping $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150~$250 for a great cab... why not spend that $300 or so on a great ALL-tube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels, better EQ, and the option to route to an external cab from the get-go?)",1
5044,"Working well to elevate my center channel to ear height.

5045,"To be fair, this is a quality pedal ... it gets a high percentage of good reviews ... lots of people like it ... however for me, it turned out to be OK but in the end there were other OD pedals that were simpler and gave me what I wanted ... I think this pedal will more than meet the needs for folks in the ""Paisley Zone"" of tone ... but it isn't for everyone; perhaps other pedals are better suited if you want to ""sculpt"" your own sound, not imitate someone eles's ... fortunately there are some really good choices out there in the same or better price range; I settled on a couple of OD's by Fulltone ... picking a pedal is not an easy process but if you can try before you buy, I suggest you spend some hours trying out different OD pedals before you decide ... determining a pedal for you from review and on-line demos just won't do it (believe me I know) ... if you can't TBYB, then be preapred to have a trade/sell plan for pedals that don't make the cut ... good luck and Play On!",1

5052,Good product. A bit pricey though when you consider how easy it is to make yourself.  I needed it in a hurry so I just ordered.  Works well though.,1
5053,While this is a very well made guitar stand there are design concerns. The back leg is much shorter than the other two which when using a heavier guitar tends to leave the fulcrum much too close to the tipping point. I have a Les Paul standard that tips the scales at over nine pounds and it takes very little effort to tip the guitar forward and over.  I have the back leg wedged to prevent this but I warn you to look at a different model perhaps the GS 414 if you have a guitar over seven pounds. If nothing ever comes around the stand you should be OK but if someone even walks by I would be very concerned with the stability.,1
5054,"I went through a private sale of a friend to obtain my Zoom H4n, so it's not going to confirm that I ever purchased it via Amazon. The deal was that my friend works at a production company and his boss bought a ton of them, then realized he bought too many. So, he started to sell them at a cut-rate to get rid of the extras. My experience is a little unique but I felt it should be documented anyway.

Anyway, I bought it brand new in the box, unopened, untampered with, everything still in the factory wrapped plastic and tape. Immediately, I opened everything and the contents were all in the box (no missing parts). I put batteries in and started doing tests. First, I stood in one room and tested the mics. Everything worked fine, very clear microphones. Sounded like I was standing RIGHT there when I went to listen back to my recording. I was very happy and impressed. Then I went into another room and plugged in an external lavalier mic into the ""ext mic"" input jack located on the back. Although it was plugged in and both the transmitter and receiver were on, and I could hear myself through the headphones...as soon as I hit record, the Zoom would start recording with the external built-in mics instead of my plugged in lav mic.

Confused, I recorded anyway, unplugged my lav mic and then plugged in another lavalier mic. I could hear myself, everything sounded okay, I pressed record and it recorded through the lav successfully, no problems. I plug in the lavalier I just had problems with one more time, recorded, and I could hear myself fine...it recorded successfully. So, it went from not receiving signal to receiving signal.

SO here's where it gets really interesting. After a couple of days and using it maybe three times on the job, I think to myself, ""Well, it's been a couple of days since I got this thing, let me take it home from work (where we do productions involving automobiles) and do a review on it."" I put it into the plastic Zoom carrying case it comes with, drive home (40 minute highway drive), pull it out, pull my camera out, flip it over and the power switch on the side is loose. So loose that you can rock the Zoom back and forth and watch the switch slide back and forth by gravity.

Luckily, my friend spoke with his boss who is going to come in this morning and give me another Zoom from his stack of Zooms and handle returning this one for me since we have a deadline we have to fulfill for our next segment.

Anyway, happy but disappointed. Assembly error maybe? Who knows?",1
5055,"We all have different tastes in guitar picks, I know,  As I wrote elsewhere, the Dunlop Tortex are awful for acoustic, in my opinion.  These Ultex are much better.  Not as noisy, better feel.  Still not my favorites.  I'll have them with me for spares.",1
5056,"In fact, I might buy another.  This was my second attempt at buying a delay pedal on a budget.  Years ago had a Danelectro Fab slap echo but was not impressed and didn't see the possibilities except to make a 'room' sound.  This seems to go beyond that but is still a very simple pedal.  Hate to admit it but I can't figure out how to put a battery in it as I can't see how it opens up(supposedly the pedal lifts).  regardless, it's a great bang-for-the-buck pedal.  There is def a feel of plastic about the pedal switch but since it's just going into a switched loop I doubt if I'll ever break it.  Recommend for the beginner or cheapskate(like me).",1

Also, this harp, in my opinion, is uncomfortable to hold. The curled-up cover plates feel a bit sharp.

Instead of buying this one, save some money, and get a better harp at the same time: buy a Suzuki Manji. It is more comfortable to hold, has excellent build quality, and great tone as well.",1

I also found that you had to fit it correctly or it would make some notes louder than they would be unmuted!  My favorite mute is the heavy brass one, followed by the artino.  The heavy brass mute needs to be put on properly, though.  You need to make sure it is quite snug with the bridge or else it will vibrate and it could potentially fall off while you are playing.

All three of the mutes have the exact same slit sizes (for fitting your bridge), so if one of them does not fit your bridge, it is likely that your bridge is too thick.",1

Even though cutting allows it to fit, it loses the original tight stretch.  May be I should have cut it halfway from the small end so that it will allow the O Port to fit the sound whole by letting it overlap, in the same time it would retain the stretch because the large side is not cut.

Even with the cut, I still hear the improvement of sound quality.  So far so good, but I need to do some more test to see how it effect the various situation.

I wish it comes with the size that fits well.  However, for the price, it's worth the quality improvement.

The video on Amazon.com on how to install it is very helpful.  You actually could insert the O Port without removing the strings, with a little big of effort.

5074,"I bought this amp to replace a heavy Mackie M14000i that I got tired of lugging around.  The weight difference is fantastic.  Sounds fine and runs cool.

When I received this amp and took it out of the shipping box, there was something rattling around inside the amp (never good). I took the cover off to find that the air dam for the fan had come loose (it was lightly held in place with an adhesive strip). With the cover off, I had a look around.  Nicely designed main circuit board, but... two huge issues caught my attention:
 1) There was a glob of splattered solder on top of the board.  I picked it up with a wet q-tip, but on a board full of tiny surface mount components, this is a recipe for long term problems when it gets loose and shorts some component out.
 2) The engineers were nice enough to put connectors on the two things that often need servicing: the fan and the front panel, but some idiot though it would be a great idea to cover these connectors with globs of glue!?!?!? making them non repairable / non serviceable.

So I fired up this amp for the first time, and it is NOISY (the fan that is).  Behringer claims that the fan is speed controlled, but is sounds like it running full tilt when the amp is ice cold.  I had to put a DVM on the fan to verify that indeed it was running at 7.5V (out of 12V max) when cold.  The fan is considerably louder than the Mackie, and is noticeable from 20-30' away even with background music playing.

I've been using it for about a week now with various speaker configurations.  The amp seems happiest at low impedances (2-4 ohms).  I don't run that much power typically (150W per side into 2.6 ohms) and the amp never seems to get warm.

Pros:
Great price
Light weight
Runs cool for moderate wattage in 2 ohms
builtin hi pass / low pass filters are handy

Cons:
Manufacturing / Servicing issues
NOISY!!!!

The AT2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh. Second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser. It is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts, but there are a bunch of better mics near this price. Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 (stay away from the studio projects C1) both exceptional microphones for the price. Although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing, the MXL 2003a. A lot of people have claimed the studio projects C1 sounds like the Neumann u87 it doesn't, the MXL 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under $500. With that being said the AT2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great, to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone.

My reasoning is that it would be less expensive than a 12-string guitar, and would be a lot less time consuming than trying to keep 12-strings in tune. It works reasonably well on something like a Strat or Teley. I am, however, curious to hear the results on an acoustic electric. If you're looking for an identical 12-string sound on a standard electric guitar, you'll be disappointed. However, I will write a testimonial on an acoustic electric steel string guitar when I can find a friend who owns one.",1
5112,"This tuner is amazing, even more so considering the price. It's chromatic, so it will tune anything! I tune electric and acoustic guitars, bass, ukulele and mandolin with it! I've bought three for gifts... It's great.

This tuner *is* amazing... But fragile!",1
5113,A very light duty Drummers Throne. Didn't impress me at all but I will be keeping it. Using it for keyboard use. I own a drummers throne that I bought many years ago that is heavy duty and with way more padding and 2 inches wider. Wish I could of found a name printed on it somewhere.  I prefer it over this Mapex Throne I just purchased. To be honest here with everyone if I had been able to see this seat in front of me as to how it is made rather then buy it as I did sight unseen from Amazon I would of probably walked away from it in a store. The metal it is made with is very thin. Light to carry but I would of preferred heavier duty metal like the other one I own is made with.,1

Also, the feedback elimination circuitry helps, but again, if I invest the required time, I can manually do a better job of that too.",1

And like me you thought they were all the same... some differ in depth just enough to prohibit the lock being inserted over the strap.  So 2 outta 3 ain't bad I guess for the price. (the ""offending"" lock was trying to place it on an Epiphone Nighthawk with a Parsons suede strap.)

5124,"I've bought two Pedaltrain units - a PT2 and a PT Jr - and in my experience, you should always simultaneously order some other mechanism to attach your pedals to the board. The Velcro supplied with the PT grips well to itself, as it should, but its adhesive backing is just not up to the job.  The velcro just doesn't stick to the PT's cross-bars or to the backs of pedals well enough to prevent them coming loose.  This is an especial problem with narrow but heavy pedals where the stress on the adhesive is concentrated.  I ended up using cable ties to keep my pedals from falling off, which kinda defeats the purpose of the rig.

I've now resorted to using Godlyke Power-Grip Pedalboard Velcro Alternative tape.  Not only is the tape-to-tape connection better, but the adhesive is too. For this reason you should take it as a given that the PT will end up costing you at least 15-30% more than the advertised price to work well, since you have to buy a better tape as well.",1
5125,"I really wanted to like this pedal, but ultimately, it was so noisy that I had to return it. The chorus is very warm and inspiring. From a subtle doubling to a wide vibrato type effect. The effect itself was beautiful and lush. the one knob operation was simple and effective. However, the background noise and hiss made it unusable. I tried it at various points in my signal chain, switched out cables and power supplies, in the effects loop of my Mesa Dual Rectifier, straight into the front of the amp... nothing seemed to alleviate the noise and hiss. Too bad, it would have been great to keep it and enjoy the sounds I was getting. The noise floor was simply too high. Amazon was great to deal with and processed the return quickly and without any fuss.",1

The biggest issue, however, is the fact that this cable does NOT work with phantom power. I have tried several condenser mics, and this could not supply phantom power to any of them. I brought this up to a professional audio recorder, and he had the same issue with this same brand before.

It works very nice with dynamic mics, but don't buy this if you hope to use it for mics that require phantom power.",1

5133,"It's okay. In one very tiny box you get 12/16 or more channels of mixing, stereo recording, compressors, EQ's, effects, and a wireless interface that doesn't require an app. That part is key. No way I'd buy a Behringer knowing how well the music business has kept up with the breakneck pace of cell phone development (they generally don't). I have 2 other pieces of digital gear that are completely useless because my iPhone 3 doesn't work anymore and the Apple store stopped selling them almost a decade ago.

I really wanted to fall in love with the UI. It replaced about 100 pounds of mixer and processing gear and weighs a couple pounds. It doesn't even need a full rack box; you could fit it in a backpack. The WiFi sounded incredibly cool, too. And it's easy and intuitive to use. I was able to give the divas in my band their own personal monitor mix control so they could set levels without me. And having our sets divided into programs made it easy to set up mute groups for the horns, guitars, and vocal mics. It has automatic and adaptive feedback cancellation, which actually works. It plays intermission music off of a USB stick, and it'll record your set onto a different USB stick.

But there's also stuff I didn't like. The obnoxiously bright blue LED that indicates... nothing at all.. it's just basically a power LED.. is so bright it makes the already poorly-labeled controls impossible to see and ruins your night vision if you're trying to use other better-designed gear on a dark stage. I see that the LED is red in the photo here so maybe that's been fixed. The WiFi does indeed flake out all the time, and I discovered that plugging in a laptop directly to ethernet didn't help either; sometimes the web interface just goes bonkers and stops working. This is OK if you don't need to control it during your set... but sometimes it's not OK.. because sometimes it also just stops making sound altogether. Soundcraft put a lot of good effort into making this the fastest-rebooting digital mixer I've ever used.. but unfortunately it makes a horrendous loud crash when rebooting.. so watch your amplifier. And your ears.

The preamps being noisy? Look, it's a live mixer. The hiss in the preamps is not a big deal for a live event. If you're trying to use it as a studio mixer, get a good preamp for your mic. The thing costs $400. It's not going to have hand-wired Neve channels in it, no matter how British it looks. Yes, the noise is audible. No, it's never been so audible in an actual concert that anyone noticed. If you've ever been to a concert and put your ear right up to a cabinet you will see that all live rigs hiss.

I have a hard time believing this is an analog mixer. There would be a lot more circuitry in there if it was. I'm pretty certain that everything inside happens in the digital domain.

My band leader was so gaga over this piece that I could not make him understand that my workload as soundguy was worse than when I was hauling four crates of amps and mixers out of the van. Yeah, my back wasn't as sore anymore, but instead of working hard before and after the show, I was working hard through the entire set. I had to give up some of my own tunes because nursing this mixer constantly and dealing with all the bugs was too distracting for me to concentrate on practicing. And when he started adding all this extra garbage to it, like hard drives to store a terabyte of intermission sound, wireless routers to (not completely) compensate for the broken WiFi, recorders, brackets, USB hubs, and all kinds of other unneeded junk, we quickly made our way back to hauling four crates of gear out of the van. Not being able to focus on music and being a slave to a new rig that was much lighter than, but far less reliable than the old analog mixing gear I gave up, was most of the reason I quit and went looking for another band to play with. In a way, this mixer ruined the experience of being in a band for me.

If this mixer had working WiFi, OR if it could multitrack straight to disk, OR if it never crashed, I would be fine with it and I'd probably have bought my own to use at home. But all of those annoyances together with the retina-searing ultraviolet search light made me quickly fall out of love with the UI.",1

I like Vox pedals over crybaby's or any wah but I would never consider buying this Vox amplug for myself. I'm not a purist. I believe in using what works and it works to an extent. It's just not even close to the real thing. I know, for a fact, there are people out there who feel the same way about my RI amps and guitars and they're right. Economically they may be on another level than me. I wouldn't demean this to someone who already had one but I would suggest they save up for, even a cheap Vox ac4 if that's the sound/feel they're after. As much as I love Vox I can't recommend this item.",1
5140,"First - the old adage 'you get what you pay for' still holds true. That being said, so far it's fine. If you only need the effect once in awhile, this isn't a bad option. It does, however make a somewhat loud pop through the amp when I step on the switch (electrical noise not the physical click of the switch). It seems to do this when in a chain of effects - I don't recall that it did it when I tested it out by itself. This noise may be masked in a live situation - we record this weekend so we'll see. I will say that the switches used in this and a couple other of these cheap mini pedals are not as smooth and silent as the one on my TC Electronics mini Spark. And I would have bought a TC Electronics mini delay, but it uses a smartphone app to download configurations to it and I don't have a smartphone. And I'd like to get a pedal from etsy, but they're usually a bit spendy.

Ah - I just saw this update on the product page but it could use some better translation I suspect.- ""In case the switch clicks hard which sometimes causes a pop through the speaker, please take apart the pedal and adjust the Screw nut in the tap of the nail."" The tap of the nail?? Well I'll take it apart and see if I can figure it out. At least they gave me a troubleshooting tip, so good points for that.",1

But this IS worth the money if you want a genuine Alder, Fender body - the MUCH more expensive USA Fender bodies in '3 tone Sunburst' don't look much better I promise you.

Cons:  Not chunk-a-fied enough for onstage performance unless you have plenty of room to let it sit by itself with guitar in toe.  The rubber used on which your guitar rests is rather slippery requiring you to be extra cautious while placing your guitar.  I play a couple of different instruments and switch between tunes.  This is a concern.  Plus, while, from a portability standpoint, light as a feather is a good thing; On stage, not so much.

I was hoping for a match for the ""Squier"" branded gig bag I bought 15 years ago (which is still as good as new).  No such luck, though.  The materials used in this seem cheaper, the handles are not as heavy-duty and are more ""strappy"" if that makes sense.  That is, the handles are simply extensions of the 1.5"" strapping material.  They haven't been reinforced in any way, or folded over and sewn up into actual handles.  Just a couple of straps to grab.

I wouldn't use this as my primary gig bag if I was playing out on a regular basis, I just don't think it would hold up.  But for general use, back and forth to rehearsal, etc, I think it works just fine, and should last for a long time.

The MXR however, doesn't color your tone, it maintains your clarity and harmonics and adds a touch of compression so you just get more ""punch""... more ""crank"". Just listen to Gilby Clarke. A Micro Amp set at about 2 o'clock in front of a VOX AC-30 or AC-15 and yahooooey!!! The Boosta Grande might work okay with acoustics or for clean PA purposes, I suppose.

5172,"I purchased one of these from zounds and I kept it for a week then returned it. It sounded fine, it looked great but I just didn't feel it was worth 300bucks! I guess others felt the same way too because I see these things forsale 2nd hand on ebay all the time.

What I like about the filter is that it does make your voice sound really dry. But don't be mislead this dryness effect also varies by where you are originally recording your vocals. I found this out as I placed the unit in several locations around my studio apartment. So it's not a 100% guarantee that it's going to sound great without you having to do some Mic work.

Another thing I liked about the filter is that it's really adjustable and you can place it into lots of positions till it topples over! I don't think anything had me as nervous as seeing this 300 dollar filter hit my floor but luckily I caught it before it did. The stand itself could use some more work on SE's behalf but I suggest caution when setting this thing up.

Ultimately in the time I used the filter I realized I could probably get the same desired effect for cheaper and that's what I sought after. Eventually after some research on google I found an inexpensive reflection filter called the AE-F made by Soundkitz and that's what I ended up using. It gives my vocal range the dryness I was looking for and has really been pulling its weight in my studio. I really do enjoy using it but just be warned it's main difference is that it connects itself directly to your stand so that if your using a boom mic you might have to do some rigging up.

I really can't say this SE filter is a bad product because it isn't it's just more expensive than it should be. I also saw that there's a watered down version of it that they made but I skipped that because the AE-F reflection filter I got was even half of that price.",1

5175,"Not that good !!  Does not work well with overdrive or distortion, not worth the price at all . I would say sound wise very plastic , not real .

5176,"I'm a guitar player that enjoys a sweet, bluesy tone (Stevie Ray Vaughn, electric Clapton, etc.), sometimes dipping my foot into light metal (Van Halen, Avenged Sevenfold, etc.), and rarely into heavier stuff (Metallica, Sabbath, etc).  Sure, I'll occasionally want some Floyd, My Chemical Romance, or Hendrix, but it's rare.

Coming back to guitar after a long sabbatical--I sold my axes and pedal kit ten years ago--I needed to repurchase most all equipment.  I decided to get ""newfangled"" and get this Zoom G1 (the Expression pedal model) and keep my amplifier simple, a nice tube amp; I wanted to let the amp be relatively clean (not digitized effects in the amp), and let the stomp boxes do the modeling.

I was thoroughly disappointed with this Zoom G Pedal on so many levels.  Let's begin with the fact that it does not have the build quality of the Boss and MXR pedals that I once owned.  This is pure plastic, foot pedal, switches, the works (except for the bottom plate, which gives it some weight).  If you plan to stomp on it (gently) from standing, forget about it: you'll have to chase it across the floor since it doesn't weigh much, and baby it with a light foot (stocking foot?).

Perhaps its biggest shortcoming, which is typical for these multi-effects pedals, is that there are so many ""layers"" of programming software to wade through every time you want an effect.  It's very intrusive.  Owners may say ""You've got rocks in your head, man.  Program in the ones you want and set it, forget it.""  If one wants to do that, it's fine, but it's hard to argue the simplicity of a few knobs on a few good pedals.  Any stage musician would know that they become familiar with their pedal board enough to tweak that particular song in about five seconds.

Well, that leaves the variety as a selling point of this Zoom, then, right?  Not if you have an ear like line.  The pedal gives thin, digitized tone (at least through a tube amp; and if one owns a digital amp, buy the right one and it has most of these effects built in!).  The issue is that, if you like straight on rock and blues like i do, there are about 80% of these effects that you'd not even consider using.  If you want to sound like a space ship, a vacuum cleaner, a hover board, an ocean wave, or like a guitar playing into a bedroom ceiling fan, then this is your modeling pedal.  If you want to sound like Jeff Beck or Synyster Gates or Slash, it's really not what you want.

If you read the reviews, many say ""great pedal for the price"".  Ah, there's the kicker.  Is it the best for it's price?  There is little doubt, this is a fabulous pedal for the guitarist with a cheap digital amplifier who bought the one without enough internal modeling for their tastes and now wants to make their axe sound like a screeching goose or a herd of water buffalo or a Martian talking through a bullhorn, and who plans to play only in their bedroom in stocking feet.

But for the guitarist who wants to play straight ahead rock and blues like their favorite downloads and CDs, everything from classics to modern rock, and may play in a garage with friends, and wants easy tweaks to adjust to their favorite tone, and plays generally in shoes, the better choice is a couple of new Boss pedals (or other similar pedals), with 5-year warranties, heavy and solid, more compact in size, and know that you're paying for simplicity, tone, and build (strong).  The key to begin with is distortion, and Boss Distortion pedals like classic DS-1 start at $49.  Even a tube amp has Presence and Reverb built in, those are unnecessary to duplicate in the pedal, so use some money to buy a Looper (eg Ditto Looper) if you want a looper; much easier to use and more versatile than the one on the G Zoom box.  Who doesn't already have a guitar tuner?

With only a couple pedals plus modeling on your quality tube amp, you've got a similar set up for 98% of all the songs you're ever likely to play.  So, you decide if the seventy bucks or so for the Zoom G1 effects pedal is actually a ""good deal"".  I would say that it's sticking a toe in the water when you will eventually want to take a plunge.  Oh, but what if I don't want to play guitar in a year or so?  You'll get a heck of a lot more in resale of one Boss pedal than you will this Gx1 Pedal (which is cheap enough and fragile enough that people aren't going to buy your used one).

The beauty of distinct pedals, like the ones from Boss or any other pedal, is the ability to build your pedal board, to buy and trade and sell.  Many will buy used, such as the Boss Blues pedal, $99 new, used go for about $50; or better yet, you be the one to buy it new with warranty, then sell it for fifty bucks when you're done with it, so the cost of use is the same with much less risk than buying used in the first place.  Bought properly, and avoiding pedals that don't truly change your sound all that much (compression pedal for non-gigging guitarists, anyone?), one can have everything they need in quality pedals for $150, and sell the whole shooting match used for half of what they paid, easily, making the total cost...well...about the price of this Zoom pedal

These are my observations.  Seems the reviews of this pedal emphasize the variety of tones and the low cost; I wished to give an alternative perspective of unnecessary tones and seventy bucks out the window is the most expensive device you can buy (unless you use it as your only modeling pedal and it lasts at least several years, both of which are highly unlikely).  Cheers and happy strumming.",1
5177,"This is decent. It would be better if it had a screw down for hooking up an external ground wire from your AV and amps to help get ride of a 60hz hum or line noise.

This did help clean up my cable coaxial noise. Cant wait till the day we don't need to use a cable box anymore.

Does it make things sound cleaner, makes pictures look better? Ah no it has no effect on sound quality that I can tell, or anyone that has heard it in place.

Since the addition of dedeicated 20amp lines to my theater room this powerstrip is hooked up to a 15amp line and now only runs smaller devices that don't draw much power such as a PS4, harmoney hub, Wirless router,  cable box and Pre-pro.

If I didn't have it I don't think I would notice a difference or miss it. But its worth a shot if you really want a fancy looking power strip.

5178,"I've gone through about a dozen different sets of strings to try to land on the one I love. Change strings every two weeks and keep the boxes with a few notes to try to keep track and hone in.

I love DR strings. Great company, quality products. I love the look of the Black Beauties; very cool from that standpoint. But to me they felt like they were on the stiff side (as opposed to strings that tune up with what feels like less tension and thus softer touch). I couldn't fall in love with them though and probably won't ever buy them again because when fingerpicking they squeak. Skin of picking hand across string emits and pretty loud squeak -- at least for me. Climate, skin quality, playing style could all have something to do with that. I tried everything I could think of or read about doing: a little fingerease, or fast fret, or talk to keep things dryer, or nothing helped.",1

5183,"The the Pick Punch itself is 4.5 stars. The pick strips are about 1.5 stars. My main issue with these pick strips is that they aren't solid plastic. They are in three sections like an Oreo cookie: outside decorative layers and an inner plain white layer. What that translates to is that they don't make very durable picks because they break in layers. They need to switch to better source materials for these pick strips to be more useful and long lasting. Currently, I have pieces of broken picks all over the floor when using them.",1

5185,"Fender actually has a few of these mini amps.  I've tried out the ""Super Champ"", and while none of them has particularly ""good"" sound quality (even for the size), the Super Champ probably performs better than the Mini '57 Twin.  That being said, the Mini '57 is the most attractive of the three with actual wood casing and a fabric/tweed exterior.  Even the knobs are semi-realistic in appearance.

Unfortunately, the benefits don't extend much beyond the appearance.  The amp gets reasonably loud but has a very flat, solid-state nature to it.  It overdrives quite easily, but not in an appealing way.  Since this mini amp tends to be more expensive than similarly-sized alternatives, I expected a little better.

That being said, I most wanted it as a desk-topper or conversation piece for my office, and it accomplishes that goal just fine.  We're just in an era now were very small speakers (even inexpensive ones) don't have to sound absolutely terrible.  For example, I have a 30-dollar bluetooth speaker next to the amp on my desk, and the sound quality (particularly low) end of that speaker annihilate anything coming out of the Mini '57.  But it's an attractive decoration that reminds me of my guitar hobby, so as long as that's the intended function: mission accomplished.",1

No one else makes the side arm, put an standard screw on it...I might want to put a goose neck on it or heck, maybe a mic clip...  In their defense I haven't tried to unscrew the adapter that is in their boom (so that it fits the tiny screw) it may come out and install in my telescoping boom that I need to put on it - but why even have that silly annoyance??",1

Once it's attached it's fine, but then it's the same coming off, I have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried I'll damage a microphone.  With expensive equipment, I'd use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me.",1

That being said you'd be better off just buying something a little more dedicated than a contact transducer like this.  While it accurately reproduces the tone of a guitar (or really anything that vibrates to produce resonance) HOWEVER every single time you move, the pickup will reproduce that as well.  That means if you play in a way where any part of you is rubbing on the body of the guitar, it sounds like an orchestra of carpenters sanding wood.  I'd recommend this as more of a tuner than a go-to for acoustic guitar amplification.",1

5211,"I've owned this pedal for about 8 years.  It's good overall, but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me.  They just sound a bit inauthentic, and this is noticeable at times, but in a band setting probably wouldn't be noticable.  I think it's the way they trail off.  The tails tend to have a little unnatural decay, or something.

I've been using the Boss Fender reverb pedal for about 3 years now as my main reverb (neither of my amps have reverb) and what I've done in the last year is that I use this Digitech with a wetter setting (usually church or hall) if I want reverb on a solo.  For that application it works fine and sounds great.  As a ""leave it on all the time"" reverb I find it a bit lacking.

But if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse.  Plus this thing is obviously rugged, I've abused it (not really, just regular gigging abuse) for all this time and it's never failed to work.  But that's been my overall experience with Digitech stuff for a long time.",1
5212,Tried these multi-flexible picks but for my acoustic use they aren't flexible enough.  Otherwise they are super great and I imagine for electric guitar they would be very useful for lead & rhythm.,1
5213,"Having been a big user of the old Morley Echo-Volume Pedal, back in the 70s/, I was eager to see if finally, someone made an echo pedal, that was truly a pedal, and not just an on-off, stomp box. The unit is very attractive, pretty compact, and the sound, even when running a microphone through it, instead of guitar, was nice, and noise-free. However, I did have a few complaints, and hope they update and improve upon this first one.

First, a minor but annoying thing, was where you plug in the cables. I couldn't neatly plug in two right-angle cords, plus a power adaptor plug, without a traffic jam, since they are all in the front, and in a pretty narrow space. Related to that, was the fact that since it doesn't work with batteries, and you must have an adaptor, the fact that one is not included, seemed pretty chintzy. And I'm not so sure it was made clear in the listing, that you could not use this unit right out of the box, but would have to first go buy the proper power adapter..

The other, more major complaint, aside from the pedal not doubling as a volume pedal, as the old Morley did, concerns the reverb function.
Apparently, the amount of distance you push the pedal also determines the amount of reverb applied, as well as how much delay. If I'm not correct about this, someone let me know, but from what I could tell, & in reading the instructions, and on-line, this is how it is.
This was probably the deal-breaker that caused me to return it for a refund. Reverb is not an effect that typically increases & decreases within the course of a song, or even set. Usually you set the reverb, and leave it, then any other effects are added. I want to have the reverb there, set, and then add delay when I want to enhance it.

Delay + reverb is a nice combination. However, with the pedal back, so there's no delay, it means there's no reverb either. If I were to set my mixer channel to where the amount of reverb was just right, then I'd have to either zero out the reverb setting on the pedal, or as I gave it more delay, there would be even more reverb, probably making it too much.

That I have only a  totally dry signal, or one with reverb & delay, so that if I back off the delay, I also lose all my reverb, isn't very appealing. It would necessitate having to have & use another efx unit, to supply me with more constant reverb...",1

5220,"I guess I'm just not really into fiddling with a bunch of presets and editing them on my computer. I do like using pedals, I have a bunch of them, and I'm okay with fiddling with all those knobs (insert phallic joke), and I enjoy using my Yamaha THR modelling amp. So why did I have such a mediocre impression of the Fender Mustang? Well I guess this takes me back to the fact that this was my first amp I ever bought, back when I was first starting out with guitar, and back when I had no clue about gear and what to look for.

Being this was my first amp, I had really didn't have a whole lot of expectations, but I bought this on impulse for two reasons, It had, and still has great reviews on amazon.com, and it was really affordable, less than $100 with free shipping. Those are all really good merits, and it can be applied to this amplifier, but what I got as opposed to what I expected was where the disappointment set in. I honestly didn't know anything about amps; I'm still not that gear savvy, but am able to actually find what I like now. This amp is a modeling amp, I had no idea what that meant, or even that that meant something to most people. What it does is that it's an amp that has the capability of replicating sounds of different popular amplifier type sounds like Tweed which are supposed to be like old school Fender sounds, and British type which is supposed to be in the area of Vox and Marshall amps. It also allows you to try different effect types, like reverb, and chorus, and phaser etc. Now, that all sounds really cool and useful, but it's pretty limited, don't get me wrong ,this amp is a good sounding amp; good, but not great from my subjective, but not snobby (at least in my opinion,) point of view. What annoyed me what that it was kind of a chore to dial in specific tones, first you had to choose what kind of amp type you want, then you have to keep switching memory banks to dial in certain tones and effects when you want to try and hear a difference. If I remember correctly, if you switched memory banks but didn't mess with any of the EQ/effects settings, it would retain whatever sound was on the chosen memory slot on you're on, which is a good thing, but the memory banks to save your settings is also kind of annoying. It was denoted by a letter and whatever color your led light next to it is, i.e. memory bank ""C"" color green, which is not a very fun way to remember something, so unless you've got it written down, the easiest way to remember was to plug your amp into the computer, and use the FUSE  software to see what the settings and effects/amp type is on that memory bank. Speaking of which, the FUSE software kind of sucked, my computer isn't very fast, but the software wasn't super high tech, it just seemed lackluster and I feel people rarely used it, most of the uploaded presets people put up were kind of the same thing and there really didn't seem to be a big diverse of sound in the FUSE community. The other model Mustangs seem to have a digital display screen which tells you what preset you're using, so those might be a better investment if you're considering this amp. The only other thing I really didn't care for, and this goes for most modeling amps, the effects settings. Why do most of these companies feel the need to put multiple effects on one knob? Let alone the fact that you can't use say phaser, with chorus and reverb. The only way to do that? Use my good old friend, the FUSE software, the layout is kind of cool looking, it shows the pedal type, and the type it trying to mimic, like say bright green overdrive for Ibanez (not sure if that really was one, but using it as a reference point), but I don't really care for using my mouse to adjust the amount of of the effect, I'd prefer if each effect had it's own knob on the amp and I didn't have to hook it up to a computer in the first place. Overall, it's an okay sounding amp for the price, but there are better options I'm sure, if you like the idea of tweaking your sound via computer and maybe doing some home recording, I'd recommend finding software that does just that instead.",1
5221,"I am a fan of Alesis. I have two other of their products. I also have a drum machine that I love! And a very good 4 channel mixer for a pc. I generally like Alesis products. This keyboard was a little underwhelming to me. It is big, it has 88 keys and that is great. But the keys don't feel much better than my inexpensive Casio keyboard from Costco. And it actually has a lot less features and programability.

The weighting, for those who don't know, has nothing to do with the weight of the keys, so if you are expecting this to have heavy, ""piano feel""keys you will be disappointed. The weighting refers to the fact that this keyboard can detect the weight or pressure you strike the keys with. So if you tap them lightly, they play softly, if you hammer down on them then they will respond with louder notes. It does this fairly well.

It comes with 5 built in sounds, they are pretty good. The piano, organ and synth are good. The electric piano is ok and the bass is not bad, but the built in amp/speakers cannot keep up well at all. You cannot get any appreciable volume out of it and the lower notes simply won't play on the speakers.

I hooked up to Crown 75 watt amp that was able to power some good reference speakers and the notes are there, the 20mwatt amp and built in speakers can't handle them.

The lesson feature is nice, and I haven't fully explored Skoove, the free 3 months of online training, but it looks interesting,

This is a competent keyboard and someone who knows how to play can make it work. It is more of a no-frills, solid practice or perhaps gigging piano and it is good choice. Although it does not come with a bag or stand. It does include a music stand, but it is no frills.

It has a couple of outputs, including headphone and rca. It does not feel solidly made well enough for gigging imho.

In the end, this feels like an ok keyboard that is missing a specific purpose. There are better keyboards for gigs, and better choices for home and practice. It is kind of big and bulky and while it is nice, there are better pianos in almost any class. It is almost a jack of all trades and King of none.

Some positives. It has good sounds for piano and organ. Synth is also solid.
It has a neat practice setup with student and teacher both able to play same notes.

  >  Combats String Breakage
  >  Ends premature wear at the bridge and nut
  >  Gives you increased sustain and overall performance*

*NOTE: On the package I received the last feature states it is ""Tech-tested and approved"".
The last one on the Amazon product page, ""Gives you increased sustain...""  was NOT listed
on the package anywhere.

The reason I put up this difference is that there is so much science, snobbery and wishful
thinking when it comes to guitars and their various parts and performance abilities that
one has to wonder how anyone could measure the difference of ""increased sustain"" with or
without the Lubrikit. This is the where the huge gray area on the issue of sustain is used,
on this web site, to induce the novice to buy this product. Obviously, Planet Waves, the
maker of Lubrikit thought so as well and does not have that product feature listed.

The one above that talks about ""premature wear at the bridge and nut"". Okay, kind of makes
sense that with less friction there would be less wear, especially with the wound strings
grating against the nut and bridge. Nuts do need replacement after many years of use anyway.
I give them that one; it could help lengthen the use of the nut. If you have a luthier change
your nut it will cost you more than the Lubrikit.

""Combats String Breakage""; sure, if there is less friction and those strings are able to move
along the bridge and nut with ease the strings are less likely to break. Now, if one is a
professional musician, one is changing one's strings anywhere from daily to weekly, so this
issue is probably is a wash. If you are a home player or occasional coffee house player
maybe you might get more mileage out of your Lubrikit.

""Removes friction to help you play in tune""; I don't really understand this one. Wouldn't the
strings be more apt to go out of tune if there is less friction? I guess I don't understand
the physics of this one. I have to plead ignorance and give this one a wash.

Often many of the problems (chronically out of tune) or betterment (sustain) guitar players are
working on usually have to do with a bigger problems than simply oiling your nut or bridge. There
are so many variables that come into play that one needs a list to rule out the source of the
problems or find a way to make the guitar a better player.

For about $6.00 you will have to assess whether it is better to buy this product or say, change
your strings for $6.00, to solve the tuning problem. That is what I did. The guitar purchased
would move out of tune after playing about 10 minutes or so. The Lubrikit seemed to stabilize
the strings but only for 10 minutes. The strings were simply old and no longer usable. So I
replaced the strings. Voila, no tuning problems when using new strings.

So many questions and not many answers. I apologize for that. Yet you have to ask your self if
this product is worth the money to you. I gave it 3 stars because there is no way, short of
scientific measurement, to tell if most of the product ""features"" actually work. I have seen no
scientific data to support it other than second hand suggestions from other players. It doesn't
seem to hurt the guitar or the strings and that's a good thing.",1
5247,I found the buttonholes rather tight.,1
5248,"Not a bad little mini amp.  It does get loud but the sound is very distorted much past half volume. So if you expect this to be loud and clean, forget it.
I bought it to plug into a ukulele that has a built in pick & preamp.  What it's really good for is when playing with other guitarist, the uke can get drowned out.  Plugging it into this amp and elevating the volume just a bit works well to even out the volume level with others.",1
5249,"Ehh... thought these would be the bridge between metal picks and fingernails. They are very clumsy and didn't give me the feel I like. However, good product, fit well and pretty comfy if you like pucs on your fingers.",1
5250,"Seem more ""jangly"" at first play than I'm used to with Martin Phosphor strings.",1
5251,"It attaches easily to our solid and hollow bodied Gibsons. Of course, they both have the ""side"" knobs or buttons, not on the back as some other reviews have pointed out, which would twist your strap. The strap itself is strong black webbing -- plain looking, and nothing sexy about it. It is easily adjustable in length, and that's a good thing.

I have had no trouble putting the strap on, and only a little more, getting it off. It's handy to be able to do it quickly, and it feels secure. You don't want several thousand dollars worth of instrument crashing to the ground because of a faulty strap!

We do agree with the critics that this entire $23 item comes down to the two plastic connectors, and even more, to the seemingly flimsy ""arms"" on these that grasp each button, and in this way, keep your guitar secure. Clearly, the Ernie Ball company is proud of this clip -- they've applied for a patent. But it seems to us, unless you can easily replace this whole clip if and when an arm on it breaks, this is the Achilles' heel of the item. All four arms on our strap are functional, but we can see that if even one of them breaks off, your money will be down the rat hole.

This is a great idea for this strap, made to let you get it on and off easily. But there's a big problem if and when the plastic clip gives out. You've been warned!",1
5252,"For the prices you get a lot of sounds but many are just useless white noise. Levels can jump up or drop severely from normal to effects..... no even in and out. I just needed a few effects (flange, Chorus, etc) so for the price of under a $100 it was worth it. The ""Vox"" pedal is the size of an infant's foot. To change batteries you have to unscrew the the four rubber feet on the bottom and take the cover off. Not very convenient at all. There is no AUX-IN so you can practice with recordings. A looper would of been nice but now I am getting into a more expensive unit. If they dropped 1/2 the effects, made the battery change quick and smooth, added a 45 sec looper and AUX-IN and XLR out, it would surely be a winner! But they didn't!!",1
5253,"This is a rather lightweight but well constructed pedal. I have used it with a Roland Juno Stage. It works well for triggering effects such as the rotating speaker effect. The downfall of this pedal is that when used as a Volume pedal, it provides a Very limited range of volume; not enough to be practically useful. I replaced it with a Yamaha FC-7 pedal, which provides an excellent volume range, and is an even more solidly constructed unit.",1
5254,Very thin compared to my other cords--this is more closer to pedal connector thickness.  It also carries a lot of capacitance for a 10-foot cord.,1
5255,"made using as little material as humanly possible -  Thin tubes and somewhat flimsy.

It does 'work' however.  It's just not all that stable - and as for durability - we shall see, but my hopes are not high on this one.",1
5256,It's a pick...,1
5257,"I read some of the reviews, and I'm not sure why some are rating this so highly. I play at weddings, corporate events, and festivals and I wouldn't bring this to mix a jazz trio with as one person has suggested. It really doesn't have a lot of power compared to a real PA system.
This I plan on using when I don't have a want or need to lug a PA around. It does have a decent volume level for moderate sized rooms, but again, the last thing I would do is mix multiple channels on this thing. As far as vocals though, it will suffice. It doesn't cover much bass, to be expected from a 4.5 inch cone.
Why did I rate it as ""liked it""? Well because I was simply looking for a small solution for my smaller to medium vocal gigs. I would also put my keyboard or sax through it, but again I would never mix anything with this little thing.",1
5258,A bit clumsy in its responses.  Hard to read the needle,1
5259,"I purchased this amplifier to pair with a Pyle PASW18 18"" subwoofer cabinet.  It absolutely works, but there are some drawbacks that will cause different users different levels of irritation.

First, the amplifier is powerful enough to drive a single 18"" sub to be heard in a live sound situation with a relatively loud band, but, with the sensitivity near maximum.  The specification for output power seem to be not really stated anywhere.  1000W seems to be about what the amp will output in bridged mode at maybe 2 or 4 ohms.  I'm guessing the power output at 8 ohms bridged is closer to 200W, but I can't really say.  The amp is lightweight, so that's a plus.  Now on to my concerns:

My biggest issue with the amp is that it does not fit in any of my rack cases, and I have several different ones.  It sortof almost fits in my great big plywood case, but the vertical spacing on the screw holes doesn't jive with anything I've ever seen.  The horizontal spacing also seems really off, compared to my other rack gear, making it not at all fit into any mainstream rack cases.  I thought I'd just use it without a case, but even being very careful with the product, it is showing a lot of wear on the case, cosmetically, so the finish seems to not be holding up on par with anything else I own.
The inputs and outputs are nice to choose from - the amp accepts XLR and 1/4"" inputs.  I use a DOD crossover, which has a balanced 1/4"" output for LOW SUM OUT, so the option to use a 1/4"" TRS input is nice for me.  There are binding posts and ""Speakon"" outputs.  I have exclusively used the speakon outs and they make good connection, but feel a little cheap when connecting and disconnecting, unlike anything else I own that has speakon connectors, save for my sub cabinet from this very same manufacturer.

Personally, I am not remorseful about my purchase, but, if I had to do it all over again, I'd get something else.  My Behringer iNuke1000 is lighter, fits perfectly in my rack, and is comparable in loudness.  It lacks the 1/4""TRS inputs, but I can use an adapter.  Maybe someday when I have some money set aside to improve my rack, or, more likely, when this amp dies on me in the middle of a show, I'll replace it with a Behringer.iNuke3000 (400W into 8 ohms stereo).

In summary, pros and cons:

PROs- low price, nice I/O options, works okay
CONs- cheap chassis not conforming to standards,  low-ish output",1
5260,"OK however not very thick nor very high quality. Very basic. Also got another brand of a ketboard cover around the same time and the same thing. It will work, however, surely there are better quality covers out there somewhere?",1
5261,These are too small for the microphones on the headsets I have. Thought they'd stretch enough but they didn't.,1
5262,"Sad this unit doesn't sit at an angle back toward me.  It sits horizontally level/parallel to the floor.  I'd like it to slant, or be adjustable to various angles.",1
5263,"These aren't my favorite banjolele strings, as they sound a bit dull to me.  I much prefer the Aquilas banjo ukulele strings as they have a brighter sound on my Recording King concert.  The LaBellas are super-long, I think I could get two sets out of all but maybe the C string!

I'm keeping them for emergencies, but recommend the Aquilas instead.",1
5264,Didn't work for me.  I hate um.  Gave it three stars only because the quality is outstanding.,1
5265,"I thought cotton would be more comfortable, but this strap is just OK. I had trouble with the eyeholes being too tight to slip over the fasteners on my Epiphone and PRS. I finally stretched them the out and got them on...but just barely.
IN comparison to my Fender and Smith straps, this is my least favorite, but for less than ten bucks, I had to take a shot.",1
5266,"I bought this control surface to use with Reaper (DAW) running on a 2012 macbook pro. What I found was that the only way to use this is in reaper is to download klinke's mackie mcu plugin. Even after you download that, the compatibility is spotty and a lot of time and programming is necessary to get it working smoothly. A deal breaker is that you can't get fx plugin feedback to the bcr2000, which means you have to use something called ""soft takeover"" which is really annoying when tweaking plugins.

Long story short, it wasn't as compatible as I had hoped. I ended up returning it and getting a Novation Nocturn for my purposes.

All in all, this is a pretty sweet controller, just do some research before you try to get it working with Reaper in particular.",1
5267,"its ok but not the killer unit the hype says it is....a lot of unusable tones....
I can live without it....",1
5268,It works good. I prefer my previous Gibson polish which was in an aerosol can.,1
5269,Does the job for a good price.,1
5270,"The vinyl covering was not glued down sufficiently. It came loose in 4 places.  I will apply contact cement....easier than shipping it back!
Other than that, it's a nice case.",1
5271,We had to return them because they are very short,1
5272,"Just ok. I play more with a pick than with fingers and find that with these they sound better when playing just fingers.
The bottom sounds lacking and the stings seem a bit on the thick side.
I prefer a true lightweight and these seem more medium weight.
They do seem to have less squeaking than the stings they did replace.",1
5273,"It gets the job done.
I've had an expensive version of this and it sounds the same.
The body is plastic and cheap though.",1
5274,a good deal for twenty dollars...i think it would be fun to feed it into a casio wk 200 sampler,1
5275,Meh,1
5276,"Not the most stable and moves a bit but as long as you don't bump into them, they're great.",1
5277,Does the job. I would say it is the weak link in my signal chain however it has never been an issue (yet). Using it on a pedal board that had a power supply that died to power two or three digital effect pedals. Great to keep using my original pedalboard without replacing the expensive power supply.,1
5278,"Wow, this was pricey! But the only thing I could find for finger positioning on a violin. It came on time and undamaged but it is just stickers. Really if I had had more time I would've searched for something a bit cheaper.",1
5279,"To be honest I'm not very impressed by these, they are and feel cheap. I'l get more expensive strings next time and go back to Medium since these are too bright for my taste",1
5280,Durable. Hold up well with concert playing but not marching band.,1
5281,"Cheap plastic with some metal. They work yet they are not smooth and I have no idea if they would last. If you are looking for some spare parts to have in a guitar repair kit, they are a good price and better then having a broken machine head.",1
5282,sound low and tight,1
5283,"I just bought a pair of these and used them at the first gig on Friday.

The BAD:
1) I doubt that these are actually 1000 watts. I have used other speakers that were much louder. I can crank them and sit right in front of them and not feel it, so they definitely don't push much air. They can get loud, but don't seem powerful. I tested them a crappy korg 100W PA system with 2 8"" speakers and the Korg may have pushed more.
2) Due to the lower volume, the gig I did for 200 people Friday (I expected only 100), wasn't hardly loud enough for people to hear 30 feet back.
2) They sound way too hyped to me. It sounds mid scooped with the uppers slightly boosted and the bass slightly boosted. In light of the bass boost, unless you use them in monitor mode, they need to be on stands or else the bass will overpower the speaker (not in a good way, more in a feedback sort of way).

The GOOD:
1) They match my anthem pickup pretty well and give it a good sparkle due to the eq and clarity",1
5284,"Good Sound, easy to tune, only concern is that it is somewhat fragile",1
5285,"It seems to work just fine but if she isn't using it much, well, maybe it isn't the product's fault. I am a pianist and keyboardist so I find the small keys a little painful, but that's hardly a surprise!",1

5287,"didn't realize these picks were so tiny, about half size of normal pic.  the texture is nice, but too small for me.",1

5289,"If you want more heavy duty get the 800 or 900 series PDP is a good product for price but if you play ""hard"" more than a beginner I would recommend spending a few extra $$ for the 900 series hardware",1
5290,Tailpiece has a scratch on it. Thinking of sending it back.,1
5291,Very noisy with no way to get rid of it with gain control.  I still use it but it is not near the quality of the one my friend has.  Wish I had looked at the name of his......it was amazing.  This one works but man is it ever noisy with lots of strange sounds.,1
5292,I got two years out of them before a section of the coiled cord degraded internally and shorted out.  I cut out the faulty section and that fixed the sound but now there's also a bad connection somewhere in the earcup.  More surgery I guess...,1
5293,Not very good. Crap tone. What do you expect out of a tiny plastic amp!,1
5294,"For the price works well, but it provokes considerable high frequencies loss.  You have to add all the highs to your amp to compensate.",1
5295,"This product is less a brush and more of a ""fluff"". Pushing it through the slide after playing picks up some moisture and probably does keep the horn clean, a bit like pulling a cloth through.

For what it is, it is ok.",1
5296,"I like this bag quite well, it's nicely padded, but the stitching along the length of the bag, as it passes one of the handles, has already pulled out (after only two uses).  Because the handle doesn't depend on that stitching, I believe it will continue to support the bag, structurally.",1

5299,"I am revising my previous review on the 3250L's...
I have now only had these on my American Stratocaster for two weeks.  I loved them so much at first that I ordered 5 other sets and restrung several of my other Strats and other guitars.
BIG mistake.  Why am I so impatient?
These were unbelievable right out of the box, bring my Strat to life, giving it an unbelievable feel and sound.
But, with every positive, there's usually a negative....and wait for it.....wait for it...yup, there was.
I changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my Strat and noticed all three smaller strings. G,B &E were all flat on the fret side.  They were already worn out.  I suspected something as the sound had changed already too, becoming flat after only about a week.
This is NOT mu only guitar, I now have 17 total and rotate playing so I bet I hadn't played the Strat for more than6 hours or so.
Now, I'm so disappointed.  I'm going to step up to the 250's, then the 150 if I have to.  I love the sound but don't want to change strings every week.
To make a long story short, I wouldn't buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings.",1
5300,"ok idea, but pad to thin bearly touches the strings, plus the action is very low on my guitars so it won't go all the way up the neck towards the nut unless I stretch the strings. so I just run a fiber cloth with a little cleaner under the strings and you old timers like me might remember the tool for wiping off the dust from  your records. well I still have one so I use it to wipe down the top of the strings",1

5302,"Not entirely clear that this is a string through the body bridge in the description. It only has one picture... which does not show the backside of the bridge to know if it has top loading holes or not (which it does not).
 Not all standard MIM Fender products have the string through version of this bridge, some have the top loading, so the description is not accurate either.  It is a good quality bridge other than that, for a decent price.",1

Using the FretGuru in practice takes some patience and a really good eye. If your using a precise instrument like the FretGuru, you need good eyes-  especially for the fret wear depth gauge. I was not blown away like all these 5 star reviews and maybe my expectations were too high.  I'm just a guy who likes to play guitar for fun and tinker with my guitars and if my string height is off by 1/32 of an inch, it's not a show stopper for me.

5317,"I've owned several multi-effect pedals in the past, even one Digitech.  Up til now, they all had one thing in common: layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments.  It was a pain.  Then I saw this one...with KNOBS! I did a lot of research, and was torn between the RP255 and the RP355. I decided to go cheap and got the RP255.  So far, that was an OK decision.  The RP255 has plenty of features, and is a good compromise between menus and knobs.  I recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation.

To sum up the device quickly, the RP255 is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want, but you may need to work at it.  As with many multi-effect pedals, there is a selection of (60) factory tone/effect profiles, to save you the trouble of programming new ones.  These are mirrored by 60 ""user-defined"" profiles, which are identical to the factory presets.  The difference is that #1-60, can be modified by the user, or left as-is.  The factory presets, # 61-120, are not modifiable.  So, you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory.  You can also ""reset"" the entire device if you want to, but if you do you will lose all of your modifications.

In addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer, there are also two additional features which are very useful: a (pretty basic)drum machine and a 20 second looper.  The looper is really why I bought this pedal.  It's easy to use, and it overdubs.  I only wish Digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper.  20 seconds really isn't much.  FYI, you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time.  No biggie for me.

OK, all that's good, so why am I disappointed in this unit?  Pretty simple.  I'm an older guy, who has been playing for approximately 50 years.  I've played every kind of music there is, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets.  This may be a slight exageration, but it seems like 95% of the presets are some sort of (obnoxious) distortion.  Come on guys, not all of your customers are 13 years old!  I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices.  Now, I'm faced with working out all of my own presets.  I'm back to programming menus again, ugh!.

So that's about it.  It's a solid piece of equipment, with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from.  In all honesty, if I had been aware of this, I would have probably not gotten this unit, inspite of its good design and quality.",1

5326,"... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong.",1

5331,"Marketing Claims versus Delivered product. In this case on the razors edge of over stated with overzealous cost cutting shortcuts evident. QC generally refers to Quality Control (in this case fast and loose.)

It's not a bad instrument for the asking price. Several flaws are evident such as the binding intersection located at the neck joint which is a little arbitrary on one side (Yay, not a bolt-on!). Also the plating of the bridge posts shows several pits. Advertising claims it delivers setup (For a 3 armed monkey wielding a mallet....). Stickers on the back of the headstock confirm QC and setup (by a slacker obviously).  Delivered condition of setup-terrible, horrible, awful and otherwise poor (there are strings, and screws affix various components :-). Strings are hacksaw finished but could help file down new frets. Fret work is smooth already however on a straight and true neck. Finish is attractive, semitransparent and delivered as glossy in contrast with the satin finish appearance of the product image on this page.

Can it Be Saved?
Gloriously, by adding coated strings such as Elixir's or DR Extralife-10-46 gauge (stock string gauge). A good Polish, and a real setup including bridge height, saddle adjustments, pickup heights,  string height ( it eventually agreed to low E@12thfret / 2mm height, hi E@1.5mm height. then some slight nagging to eliminate a buzz between the nut and 1st fret. Lemon oil on the fret board. A dry lubricant applied to the nut and bridge components.

 Restrung with DR Red Devils, the tone unplugged sounds really musical and well balanced.
 Playability- fast and fluid all the way up the neck and very easy on the fingers.
 In the end with substantial work invested its now a decent guitar for the price.

But, no yearning for two of these or other Epiphone offerings.

First off, it's made out of a cheap plastic and long term durability is questionable.

Thirdly, When my gigging partner has his pageflip on, my sync just quits. What is that about?

Unreliable would be the bottom line here.  I've emailed tech support and have not yet received an adequate reply.

5342,"The sound is lovely, and the intonation was perfect when I bought it.  The action was a little high for my liking, but compared to everything else I had played, it sounded wonderful.  However.....

After 3 years of playing this instrument, it has started to change considerably.  I live in Maryland.  Quite humid.  The deflection in the top has become extensive.  Either the instrument has either dried out enough that the top over the sound hole has flattened considerably while top behind the bridge has retained its arched shape....or its too wet and the back of the top is bulging.  I don't know which.  Either way, the result is that the bridge has raised up in the rear and rocked forward maybe 8 degrees, throwing the intonation way way off.  There is a 1/16"" gap between the bridge and the top, its literally coming loose, and I fear it may pop loose soon.",1

5344,"This tuner works ok and was priced right. We have a lot of Snark tuners laying around the studio. I bought this one to complement a Fender bass I gave my GF as a Christmas present. It has a difficult time reading an open low E string on bass but playing a harmonic at the 12th fret gets good results.

I would not go out of my way to buy this again. Personally I've found that the Boss stomp box tuners are faster, easier to use and yield better results. Yes they cost more than these vibration sensing style tuners and you must be plugged in to use them but the accuracy is important to me in live situations. Too often, vibration tuners indicate I'm in tune but it's still a little off and requires a second round of tuning. My Boss stomp box tuner always gets it right the first time which is really important in a live performance situation.

5349,"I purchased this amp from a local guitar center for about 20% off the list price. I basically like the amp but find two main flaws -- shared EQ makes having 2 switchable channels a lot less useful -- I find they need different EQ settings -- and the 2 button foot switch really is lacking for stage use. It's really too bad because the amp is otherwise pretty impressive. The reverb is weak and the effects loop is not foot-switchable. If all you need is the Marshall sound and you want it without tearing your head off with volume or breaking the bank, this amp is a good option. If you need 2 channels, with full controls and switchable, this isn't it.

PROS
- Clean channel is excellent - surprisingly, in a side by side test with a Fender Deluxe Reverb (also still like new) I liked the Marshall clean better. That really surprised me. I did not try the Marshall in a band setting however, and it is a little bassier and may not cut as well as the Fender. Not sure about that. But it sounded really great on the clean channel, just playing.
- Dirty Channel sounds like a Marshall. Two modes, one just has more gain than the other.
- Price is competitive in the marketplace.
- Size & Weight make this fairly convenient as a gigging amp for small/medium clubs
- 40W/20W power option helps bring the volume down a little bit, when you want that, while also offering plenty of volume, when you need it.
- Versatility in available sounds with the various modes

CONS
- Shared EQ for the Clean and Dirty channels is really an excessive cost reduction. I would have much preferred to pay a little more and have separate EQ controls. In fact, I found it impossible to dial in what you need on both channels at the same time. This is the main thing I dislike about the amp, and in my opinion is a big oversight in product design. The whole point of a channel switchable amp is to be able to dial in 2 or 3 sounds and switch between them. Not having separate EQ per channel is proving to be a deal breaker for me and I have decided to return the amp because of it.
- Only a 2 button foot switch -- channel and reverb. Really a shame. A lead boost switch would be helpful, as would the ability to switch the modes from a foot switch, and most notably, being able to switch the effects loop on/off.
- As many other reviews have noted, available reverb on this amp is very minimal.
- Made in Vietnam. Not a terrible thing, just be aware that you're not getting a ""made in England"" Marshall.

Overall I'd say this amp is ok if you are primarily going to use one channel, and don't care as much what the other sounds like. (This depends on the style and range of music you play, whether you play at home or on stage, etc.) You could set up an EQ Pedal and do further EQ for one of the channels with that, but it then requires two stomps to fully enable that channel the way you want it. It is a real shame they are not separately EQ'd channels. Overall, a decent amp for the price. I wanted to love this amp, and I do like the sounds, but the inability to switch between channels, modes, and lack of a foot-switchable effects loop makes it just another amp. It's really a bummer because this could have been a really great amp with a couple additional features enabled, but instead its just OK and in my case, even though I got a good deal on it brand new at GC (20% off), I returned it.

If you have to have ""the Marshall sound"" and can live with the shared EQ, this is a decent option that doesn't break the bank. But I think your money might be better spent on a used Marshall with more foot switchable capability effects loop, and separate channel EQs. I do really like the 40/20 watt option, the clean channel, and the various sounds you can get out of the amp.
Marshall should consider a product rev to improve the reverb, add EQ for both channels, and a 4 or 5 button footswitch with channel, reverb, effects loop, mode, and boost. With that, this would be an awesome amp for the money and very, very versatile.
You can do worse for the money than this amp. In the end, its worth a try if you're on the fence. It depends how you plan to use it whether it can be your dream amp or not. For me, it was not.",1

Well, I'm here to say it again, ""Balls Are Best"".  The coating was gone after one session in the studio and I really couldn't tell a difference, soundwise, between the DR Neons and Ernie Balls.  Plus, they are way more expensive for one set of DR Neons than a set of Ernie Balls, Gibsons, Fenders, or any other number of strings.  I've got to remember that more expensive doesn't necessarily mean better.  Now the DR Neon Bass Strings are great, both in looks and sound!  But if you're just needing great sounding guitar strings, I'd stick with Ernie Ball, Fender, Gibson, or any of the rest of the many brands out there.  Sorry, DR, but I won't be buying these again.",1

To my delight latency is not an issue with this item! We just brought this home from the local guitar center. We do on site live recordings & were hoping to find something portable for pre-production work. We were prepared to pay double from what we'd seen at the Guitar Center website & happened to find this item in the store just waiting for us. Before making our purchase we first checked Amazons reviews on the item we initially planned to purchase that costs more than double the price & found it had an average of only 2-3 stars; whereas this item had an average of 4.5 stars and less than half what we were prepared to pay. There was also no installation CD to worry with. Installation couldn't have been more simple. This item is truly plug and play - very impressive! After testing it out, I couldn't be happier. We are using this with Presonus Studio One 2.6.2 on a Windows 8.1 Toshiba laptop with an 8core i7 processor.

Lancia becomes an issue when using digital drums over a USB 3.0 connection. We first experienced this while recording MIDI from a Yamaha DTXtreme IIS via standard MIDI output to a USB MIDI input on a Windows 8.1 Toshiba laptop with an 8core i7 processor. The issue was only somewhat noticeable during recording, but became very apparent upon playback. Latency is not as noticeable with less rhythmic instruments such as keyboard for example. Our rating is now three stars, due to the time lost having to go back, fix, and even quantize MIDI drum recorded data.",1
5362,"As a lot of people have already outlined, these are way too tall for basically any guitar ever. If the rollers were in the same plane as the bases, then there'd be a good break angle. As they are, they are unusable. However, they're made out of aluminum, so I was able to use my Dremel to cut the height of the base down to 2mm, and that yielded a usable break angle. I wish that the rollers were made out of aluminum as well, but they are plastic. The black on the bases is enamel, so if you're not careful it chips and scrapes off easily. Overall, it's not a great piece of hardware. But it's cheap, and once you've got everything cut and polished and put in place, it looks ok, and if you've got a vibrato the strings slide a lot more easily back into tune.",1
5363,"I purchased a couple of these for possible use with harmonia playing through a mike. The hope was that they would be fairly transparent to sound while eliminating the sound of metal clanking on metal.

Alas, the foam does in fact eliminate the clanking, but it also deadens the harmonics associated with different notes. The result is a  significant loss of depth and warmth in the sound that the foam actually lets through. Matters are slightly better with vocals, but harmonics are still deadened. The foam itself is also not of terribly high quality and is unlikely to survive regular use for more than a couple of months (unless it is just permanently left in place on the mike).

Under these circumstances, I can't give this higher than three stars in spite of the low cost of this item. Sometimes nothing at all is a preferable choice to something that does its job poorly.",1

They are not particularly difficult to operate, and I use them to give my recordings that subtle indescribable ""pro"" sound.

The cost is very reasonable.

I would give it five stars except for one thing. The copy protection setup is far too aggressive.  Anytime anything has aggressive copy protection it means one thing. You bought it, you paid for it, but you are going to loose it!  Systems such as Ilock and Pace are far too convoluted and only work when everything works perfectly.  In the real world things happen.  Disks fail, computers sometimes need to be reformatted, people upgrade computers.  In such situations, you may be able to restore the software from backups, but the copy protection will keep them from working.

This means that when these inevitable problems occur, you may spend half an hour reinstalling your software but days running around in circles trying to get your plugin's copy protection to work.  In a large number of cases you simply will not be able to get them to work again.  Hence ""You bought it, you paid for it, but you are going to loose it"".

I will at least say that BBE has given a disk validation as an alternative to the Ilok key. Ilok is absolutely the worst one imaginable and I recommend that no one ever by any Ilok product under any condition.  However Pace the disk validation is only slightly better.

The bottom line is this.  When a comparable product comes on the market with less aggressive copy protection, then go for it.  However in its absence the BBE products are great as long as you understand what you are getting into.",1

5386,"As this is a ""package"", I feel it's important to break it down to the components to know what you're getting.

Ukulele: 4-4.5 stars
Beginner Package: 2 Stars

Why the discrepancy? Well, the Ukulele itself is very nice.  It's well made, sounds good, is complemented with quality components (Nylgut strings and Nubone saddle) but you are paying for a package and calling this a starter set is a quite a stretch.

So what is supposed to come in the beginner set?
* Rainbow series Mahalo Ukulele
* Carrying case
* Digital training video.

What came in my set?
* Rainbow series Mahalo Ukulele
* Dust cover with handles - very inexpensive carrying case, more like the press-fiber dust covers that you get with some electronics or appliances.
* ....  Yes, there was nothing else in the box.  No digital code on either a piece of paper or printed on the box.

I actually don't know what the difference is between this set and the standard Rainbow series release as that apparently comes with a carrying case (which is most likely the same dust cover with handles.)

In summary, I can recommend the Ukulele but it's hard to recommend this package over the cheaper basic Rainbow series release unless you like the color of this instrument better than the candy-colored releases in the Rainbow series.",1
5387,"I have the marshall head and cabinet.  For me the tone was a below average solid state sound.  Highest gain channel is harsh and a little mushy.  Clean is good, lower gain channels ok.

None of the pieces, saxophone/neck/mouthpiece, was wrapped for protection like the clarinet, which was wrapped in a cloth like sleeve. When I opened the case, which is a nice case, there were fingerprints visible on the bell of the sax. The gloves appeared to have been worn as the thumb was inside out. It came with a box of reeds, which the box said was 10 reeds, yet there were only 9 reeds in the box. It's still a nice instrument, but it just seems completely the opposite of the beautiful clarinet I purchased from them. I guess I just expect a certain level of packaging and care when it comes to the purchase of what I thought was a brand new instrument. I've seen an unboxing video on youtube of the same instrument and the niceness and care of that packaging is not at all what I received. Plus the neck strap is junk - extremely painful to wear.  You will need to purchase a ""real"" neck strap. Everything pictured was in the box (minus 1 reed).",1

They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels.  On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice.... a lot of harmonics and output captured. For that 5 stars easy.  I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold.  Other's may feel differently I am sure.  Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output.  So you are getting what they say.

However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels.  For that 1.5 star.  Average to 3 I guess... :).  Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame).  Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment.  For shredding go cobalt... for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!).  I also really like the d'addario pures.

Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel.  Hope this helps.",1
5405,"Put into perspective, this is the lowest cost 2 channel DI..

So you get the ability to eliminate ground hum between an instrument and a mixer.. and if thats the problem then its a cheap solution.

Just don't expect pristine sound quality or a high level of signal... Signal dynamics seem a bit flattened and  the ""0dB"" attenuator still leaves the signal SIGNIFICANTLY weaker at the output than the input, so while you will lose your hum, you may well add hiss by needing to turn the mixer/input gain up SUBSTANTIALLY.",1

5410,"I bought this so I don't have to fire up my tube amps and pedalboards if I'm just practicing at a low volume.  It's fairly small and light that you can carry it from room to room in your house.  With two 6.5 speakers, it is louder and sounds fuller than the Yamaha THR10 I compared it to in the store.  It has 6 voices but I find only 4 that suit my playing.  The OD1 & OD2 are too high gain and gets cut by the noisegate.  The effects, (reverb, delay & modulation) work very well.  I'm glad this amp had good cleans, nice crunch, & good effects because all my pedals didn't sound good in front of it, except for the crybaby wah.  One big disappointment though is the music playback feature.  Plug in your mp3 player and music will come out......but not that good.  It doesn't have enough bass & distorts easily when you turn the volume up.  My cheap 3 piece powered computer speakers sounded way better!  This is a good guitar amp but a lousy boom box.  In fairness, the Yamaha didn't exactly move me in the music department either......too tiny sounding but better than the Blackstar.  Perhaps some modders will come up with a few speaker replacement mods soon.  You can also connect the amp to your computer using Blackstar's Insider software for further tweaking the presets.  You will be happy with this amp if you utilize it for what it was designed for and consider it's few shortcomings.  This was designed to sound good at low volume levels for bedroom practicing as well as jamming with some friends.

Also, the cord is about 3 feet long which is on the short side even for listening to music on your iPhone, but just silly for a musician unless you plan to sit on the mixer board.

Outer shell is solid and seems well made. Shoulder straps have quality connectors.

The downside to this type of case is (1. the accessory compartment is extremely shallow - almost unusable, (2. aluminum edging around the case opening could damage your guitar if you are not careful.

5430,"I was intrigued by these picks, as I read that they were the same material as the Tortex I love so much, but I liked the idea of the ""star"" to keep the pick from flying during, um, ""robust"" playing. :)  What I quickly discovered is that for me, the star hole is position way to high on the pick to be of any use.  Just my playing style, I guess: I tend to choke up on the pick.  Also, while the material is the same thickness (.60mm) and color as the .60mm Tortex, it's stiffer.  The combination of less give in the material and the need to grip the pick up higher to make use of the star caused me to snag and even break strings.

I don't think any of these things is a fault of the product, per se.  It's just not a good fit for my playing style, and I'm not willing to adjust my playing style just to accommodate an innovative pick design.

I may actually try to drill holes in a couple of my Tortex....",1

Of course, as an orchestra light, it couldn't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose, I am just pointing out that I feel it isn't worth 40 dollars, when you consider the whole field of similar lights (those not intended for orchestra).

Don't get me wrong it is a nice solid unit with a tremendous amount of effects but for us old school Line 6 people it was a real let down. The Line 6 Insane amp is gone! It was a signature piece in their other units. They have some new Line 6 models but they don't stack up. Also all those wonderful Line 6 patches like ""Eruption"" are missing. My Spider IV has a huge selection of pre-made patches for songs from the 60's to the 2000's that are remarkable accurate so I assumed they would all be in this unit only better!  Wrong!

5439,"Well, actually, not quite!
I was a little disappointed in Behringer this time,
I know they make decent entry stuff, but this unit is easily $10-20 overpriced. Not for what it offers, but it lacks audio quality!

The good:
It's lightweight, and quite small,
It works like it should,
The echo sounds pretty ok!
It has quite a number of feats...
The bright on the eq, sounds really nice!

The bad:
- the bass on the eq sounds pretty bad (boomy)
- It could be smaller. When I looked inside, it appears to me Behringer could have fitted it all in half the size. The box is literally empty inside!
- the reverb sounds horrible! Even though it says 24 bit, it sounds more like 16 bit to me. There is a lot of artificial background noise on that reverb. Like a metallic static...
- the echo is at only 1 tap tempo. If the song goes faster or slower, you can't adjust the echo's repeat speed.
- The power adapter is like a brick to the device. Too heavy and large. They should have gone with a digital one (AKA your smartphone adaptor).
- the sound output is only via RCA (red and white plug). The unit could have easily had a headphone amp built in for the price!
- The noise cancellation only works halfway. The mic still rings quite easily, and it's hard to turn up the volume louder than what you're singing.

All the negatives would have made this a great buy at perhaps $45. But not at $60+.
I would say, save your money for something better!",1

5446,"I like my guitar. But, I have to admit, I wish I had just spent an extra $100 for a better guitar. I ended up buying a Yamaha FG700s. The sound is much better and it's easier to play. This guitar is pretty decent. But, at this point, I don't find myself wanting to play it now. I let my kids strum it and it's the one they're allowed to use since they inevitably bang it into a table or something while moving it. I think among $100 guitars, this is a good one as my son has a similar Fender model that I think is just not as good. The factory setup was okay, if a little high. I find I can make chords more easily on my Yamaha than this Epiphone.

I guess I was thinking that if I ended up not playing guitar as much, or at all, then little would be lost by spending so little on this guitar. But, now that I think of it, the Yamaha is a better idea. It's twice the price but it's such a popular guitar that it has good resale value, whereas this guitar might get me $30 - $50 if I tried to sell it. For now, I will keep it in case someone else in the family wants to play it.",1

5453,"Does what it says and does it well. However, at the very front of my chain of seven true-bypass devices and a Boss RC-3 looper at the very end, this unit was completely unnecessary and actually garfed up my sound a little bit. This tells me that my setup simply has no problems to fix - my tone is clear as day from one end to the other on my pedalboard. Since Boss pedals have their own buffer (and I will never own one other than the estimable RC-3), I suspect that it is buffering the sound as it heads toward my amp (everything is chained in front - no effects loop). No harm, no foul. I'll keep this until the day that I might need it (in the unlikely event that I wind up with 20 damn pedals on my board).",1

Well, it is padded, but I've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and I can say that the case is nicked up ""pretty good,"" as they say in the South.

Now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the ""guardian"" fails to guard against crushing your hardware.

5457,Good effects. Needs a better Noise Gate.,1
5458,"Finish is nice, price is more than fair. When you pick this thing up you know you've got a high mass bridge in your hand...pretty chunky. Of course ""chunky"" only goes so far when you are trying to make a bass more resonant. Overall string spacing is about 3/32"" wider (measuring from low E to high G) than a Gotoh 201, not enough to hardly mention, you just might want to know. Comes with mounting screws and an allen wrench which is a nice touch.

Two thing concern me with this item. Number one...mine rocked ever so slightly when you put it on a flat surface. A few passes over some 100 grit sandpaper fixed it right up...and, yes, it probably would have snuggled up just fine to the finish and soft wood of a bass guitar body anyway but you really want to see a bit more precision, even at this price. I mean, it's just not that hard to cast or machine a perfectly flat chunk of metal. Secondly, the string grooves in the 4 barrel style saddles are not cut for bass guitar strings, at least on the one I got. Without getting into string diameter...the E and A strings won't settle all the way down in these undersized grooves. Unless you take a properly sized rat tail file to these two saddles, the resonance and sustain you're paying for is out the window. If you've got DIY skills, and a Dremel or some files and sandpaper, this is a decent bridge. Otherwise, pass on it.",1
5459,"Most of the complaints I've seen about this unit are coming from people who do not fully understand how electronic tuners work.

""Tracking"" is a false issue in a tuner.  A tuner can only show what's coming into it, and on most basses the A, and especially the E, do not produce stable open notes -- something often so severe one can usually hear it, and can always see it on an oscilloscope.  If the light is swaying all over the scale, it's because the note going into it actually that wobbly.

Most tuners cope with this by heavy damping and averaging, and the indicator appears fairly stable, even if the actual note isn't.  It's simply giving you a false message.  People like this because it gives them a reassuring impression that their instrument is in tune when it's not.

Worse, people judge the quality of tuners by the severity of their damping...but the problem is not in the tuner, it's in the instrument.  ""Garbage in, garbage out,"" in other words.

These Behringer tuners do not have heavy damping because they are intended for a wide range of instruments, which makes them hard to use with some basses when in the fine-tuning mode.  This can be minimized by tuning to harmonics in the coarse-tuning mode -- or by doing whatever can be done to make the basses do a better job of producing a stable note to begin with.  If your bass is in tune and stable, this unit will indicate it.  If it's not, this tuner won't lie to you about it.

That said, these basses show the usual Behringer quality control problems and sloppy build.  I bought two of these back when they much less expensive and they've done well for me, but I had to do a bit of re-gluing of light covers and other small matters that should have been done better at the factory.  I attempted to open one unit to look at the circuitry but every screw I tried was more or less stripped.",1

Those folks however were spot on. What this is supposed to do is to emulate a clean to dirty Fender tube amp, so that you can run straight to a PC, stereo or PA system.

So..how does it sound?.. Sorry..its hype.. Its not even close. it sounds cold, sterile and lifeless.. like plugging into a $99 amp.

it gets two stars because its cheap and Its better than nothing to be sure.. its a switchable gain stage with mild dirt, or a cheap flavor changer, but there is no way on earth you can close your eyes and think you are playing through a decent Fender tube amp while using this gtr>JF-14>PA

update feb 6th: one extra star

I have added another star, and changed title from ""not even close"" to that above...so why?..
Well, Still of little to no use for PA or direct to computer use, or when the amp has a ""hifi"" quality aux input ..such as many bass amps, however...the eq and drive does a decent job of emulating that fender clean tone/mild breakup when run through a good clean channel of another guitar amp.. in my case I ran it through an Orange TH30 +PPC112 on the clean channel (massive headroom) and with the mids turned down, it did sound pretty reasonable.",1
5463,"I am new to experimenting with strings as I just had the strings on my Taylor Big Baby changed for the first time.  I decided to try these after reading all the hype.  Honestly, I like the feel of them as they are nice on the fingers, but I agree with those folks who say something about these strings sounds a little dull.  I played my BBT every day since I got it and LOVED it.  When it started to sound plunky, I took it to Guitar Center for setup and restring.  Had these Elixir nano 80/20 light strings put on it.  To me the sound isn't as bright as I would like.  Yes, intonation is good, it's easy on the fingers (I don't use a pick), and I am sure they will last a long time with consistent sound.  That's great if you like the sound, which I don't.  I don't hate them and won't be yanking them off my guitar or anything, but I don't think I will try them again.  Next will be the D'addario EXP 80/20 Light.  I have D'addario Light 80/20's (not EXP) on a low-end Ibanez that I prefer to the sound of my Taylor right now.  I will say the Elixir's do sound good if you play with a pick, but like I said I don't, so these strings aren't for me.

P.S. I haven't tried phosphors yet because I have read they require more tension, which stresses the neck and is tough on the fingers.",1
5464,"This pedal is not a RC Booster clone as describe in many of the descriptions. If the circuit is cloned... it does not operate like the RC Booster which I have on my main pedal board.

Returning it along with 3 other Donner pedals.",1
5465,"You can't really complain if they don't work for you, we all have different fingers, mammalian, reptilian, you name it. Delrin is a perfect material for picks, I use it for harpsichord plectra, for long oud picks, etc. It approximates the sound of fingernails, and it's very durable. You can shape Delrin with a rotary and a sandpaper nail file. But if they go for around fifteen bucks for three, I expect a little more attention to details and edge finish.

All that can be conquered. The main issue for me is that these picks work best for full time strummers, who mainly  play with the backside of the nails. And I'm not. I mean I don't. Not full-time. If you pick out notes with your nails against the strings all the (significant) force goes into the nail bed.  All fingerpicks have that issue and try to redistribute the force into the finger itself. The Freedom Picks end up directing it into the cuticle unless you significantly reshape them. I find it painful. The Alaska Picks are better that way.

The other issue if you use your nails like picks is that they need to be immobile and right above the finger pad. My Freedom Picks don't sit quite low enough on the pads to simulate nails. And as they wobble you wish they didn't, because they dig into the cuticle. Maybe I should have gotten the Small size, but in the promo video Fred says you can re-shape them under hot water, so the size isn't important. I disagree. Maybe the Large size would ride over the cuticles. Pushing them deeper over the finger simulates a nail better and doesn't chew into the cuticle. Fred also shows his hands, and it's clear he could never wear Alaskas, as he has no nails at all. He should offer multi-size trial packs, because it's impossible to guess.

We all kinda know that nails are irreplaceable. But you need a Plan B and a plan C. That's what various fingerpicks are. If you have a Dremel and you like to tweak stuff and especially if you strum a lot, these might be OK.  I guess I'm going to try re-shaping one. Otherwise I dunno. Guard your nails, maybe coat the tips with superglue, eat gelatin gummy bears. Don't play for peanuts, save yourself for the right man, woman or cluster.",1

This Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly.
The micro-adjusting knob for tweaking tension/pressure is nice, but I've wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar/ukulele that I have.  (A standard tension spring might be a bit too firm, but at least it's consistent.)
I also thought I'd like the curved cradle for the neck, but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele. I know, I know, this isn't designed for ukuleles, but I have no such troubles with my Kyser capos.

I don't understand the clip for a tuner on this thing.  I have several clip-on tuners that clip directly to the headstock. (And most are Planet Waves already!)  Why would I want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when I'm using the capo?  I suppose that if you have money to burn, this is a useful addition.

And the pick holder is a nice touch, but... I use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me.

5480,"These arrived quickly, bought two sets because the price was right. However they are definitely not ""heavy duty."" These struggle to hold up typical large speakers like the Mackie 450, or EV ZLX15Ps, because the tri-pod base is narrow, and the materials used in construction are flimsy. If used on a smaller, lighter weight speaker, I see no issues.",1
5481,"I have a mix of electric and acoustic electric guitars.  I purchased this stand to make it easier for me to switch guitars without banging them up as well as for taking the weight off of the guitar necks (had them hanging on those guitar trees that hold them up by the neck).  The size of the rack is just a little small for putting more than three acoustic guitars on it so I spaced it out to hold three of my acoustic guitars and two of my electric solid bodies.  Still a little tight and I had to put two of my other acoustic guitars on the hanging tree stand but all-in-all they do a fair job of holding the guitars.  Be aware that there are no straps or locks to keep the guitars from being knocked out of the rack, the rack uses gravity to hold the guitars in place so they could be bumped out of the rack.  I own a lot of Hercules guitar racks, tablet, mic and music stands and this is the first one to fall short of perfect. . .just needs a few inches more of width and some type of locking sytem to keep the guitars in the rack.",1
5482,"I was hospitalized after I ordered it, so didn't get to open it till the 30 day return ran out.  When I opened it, it had the wrong adaptor. Novation was no help. I couldn't use it so gave it to a friend who could find out how to get the (very rare) right adaptor. Apparently he could and he likes it.",1
5483,"this was a blast for me, as I love to work with guitars but if you don't have fret files, replacement tuners and strap buttons on hand, as well as knowledge of luthiery, forget it. I had to move the bridge, as the original hole placement was too far back to cover the pickup rout, and off center to the bass side. I had to replace the tuners before I even got the strings installed. I also had to severely level and recrown the frets, as they were horribly uneven and required the action to be over 1/2 an inch at the 12th fret. I also had to bring down the nut by about 1/8th of an inch to make this a comfortably-playing guitar. past that, the electronics are pretty good, they sound decent, and they have a really neat clip-together harness. The body is well prepped for painting, but not staining, you'll have to strip the sealer first for that. The neck is straight, and is a medium ""c"" shape, very comfortable. once you get it put together and set-up, it plays and sounds quite nice.",1
5484,"I don't know how Fender claims this as an excellent value for an American made strat but, it's definitely NOT! A guitar worth 1 grand isn't affordable,  yes, a thousand bucks! while the real deal Fender American Standard is just $299 away. I'm carefully aware of guitar prices and how they increase annually (American-made), from Fender, Gibson, PRS, G&L 's etc. I remember a summer Sale on Fender guitars last 2013, it was $699 for this model and $1099 for the American standard. The increase is almost $100 ANNUALLY?!",1

I work with app developers daily and to fix this issue they say its all about the developers skill set, so Line 6 needs to fire the ones they have and move on.

5488,"I got this ligature purely for convenience while instructing a novice on the chalumeau, the 17th C progenitor of all single-reed instruments. ""Authentic"" chalumeau technique requires precise wrapping of the reed with a cord, using different degrees of tightness at various nodes of the wrapping. Yes, you get better timbres. No, it's not as easy as it looks to get consistency. But my ""novice"" is impatient.

I tried this modern ligature on my own chalumeau and on an 18th C clarinet. I could hear the difference and I assume most listeners could hear it also. I also experimented with a metal saxophone ligature. I wouldn't use either for serious music-making, and in fact I've started wrapping my sax reeds with cord in proper anachronistic fashion.",1

5491,"These are decent quality cables which sound fine sonically.  The ends are metal and the cable seems well built, but they're not nearly as flexible as I would have liked.

I have been trying to find XLR cables which are high quality but offer great flexibility and don't kink easily.  Unfortunately these don't fit the bill.  Perhaps these are meant as ""studio"" cables where they will not move around much or be continuously rolled/unrolled, and for that purpose they'd probably be great.  I am using these cables with some powered speakers and have a requirement where I need to coil and uncoil them periodically.  As long as you follow all the proper cable-coiling techniques and don't let the cable get twisted inside, these should last.  That said, these cables don't seem very forgiving.  Even small bends inside tend to deform the cable slightly and make it more difficult to coil.  Also when laying out large lengths of this cable, you have to make sure they are completely unrolled/flat.  If you get a little loop in the run, the cable doesn't easily flatten itself out, and you have to actually turn the rest of the cable.  It's almost like having a length of rigid coax cable (the kind used for TVs); you could imagine that if you laid out 50' of the stuff and then turned one end, the other end would also turn.  That's how these cables tend to feel, but they're a bit softer and easier to coil.",1
5492,"I played one of these at a music store and can confirm problem 2 in Drad's letter: ""the strings will slip out of the groove on the bridge."" For example, merely bending the high E string caused it to slip out of its groove on the bridge. I got the impression that strumming this guitar aggressively would make even heavier strings leave their saddles. I also noticed that the saddles moved (i.e., wiggled) quite freely--not good! I did not buy this guitar primarily because of these very obvious bridge problems. I decided against it without even plugging it into an amp. There's a lesson here, aside from ""Beware of THIS guitar"": Don't assume that a guitar made by a reputable company is a good guitar.",1

5498,"Okay, great price. Huge, powerful, great looking Bling Thing. Makes great sound, tone, and is quite versatile. At first I had issues with mine, as the tube were not properly seated. I put in for a return/refund. Then after re-seating the tubes, this thing is literally better than any 1000$ head out there today. My biggest concern at this point, is will it last for more than a few weeks? For now, I'm holding off on my return. I'll give it another 3 weeks, play through it gently and get a feel for the durability of the components. Bottom line, if this amp is one of the good ones, this is the deal of the century. The foot switch is very nice, and built to last. The amp is quite capable, but as I've read over and over, QC on these seems to come into question at times. I'm hoping I got a good one and she lasts. This baby runs super hot, so be sure to give her plenty of breathing space. The features included make this amp very desirable. With the Master Volume, I can play at in home levels and still enjoy the great sounds this is capable of making. My guitars sing real pretty through my 2x12 V30 CAB. Time will tell on durability. If they fail, it's usually pretty quickly. Wish me luck.",1
5499,I got mine for $3.99. At that price this thing is great. I am guessing these are going to go for like $20. The tuner feels very fragile. The display is beautiful BUT you have to view it straight on. It has a full swivel head (awesome). Speed and accuracy is fair.,1

The neck is straight, Tuss rod works nicely, frets are even, (no string buzz) and frets are small easier to play than a jumbo size fret.  The frets need a little filing on the ends to make it smother to move up and down the neck, but again easy task to do.  I did replace the nut with a tuscon nut and cut it for best height on all strings. The neck body is 1/16 of an inch smaller at the nut, but that is not a problem. Standard is 1 and 11/16 and it measures 1& 10/16 of an inch or 1&5/8 of an inch.  With a little shaping at the base, a new nut, and a good finish it will look and feel like one of Leo Fender's early Telecaster models.  And that aint bad at all.  I will buy more of them.

This company also makes a large, but at 15/16 inch by 1 and 5/16 inch it's too large for anything but making large chord diagrams for teaching purposes. Where is the small or medium size??? I'm keeping the mini, but I'm returning the large. I found a company called Music Stamps at musicstampseries.com that sells a 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch 5 fret self inking chord stamp, model MSG-NN. That's a more practical size and the self-inking is convenient. Also Kay makes a 3-sided stamp, with small, medium, and large chord diagrams on one wooden block.

5520,"The Boss AC-3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator. I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. The AC3 does that job. Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful. Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.

The key to using this pedal is using it correctly.

First and foremost: use single coils. Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.

Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.

Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD).

The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone. I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case. If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.

-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly.",1

I did contact the seller Musicians Friend and they said they would refund me $15 which i still have not received due to the condition the guitar was in when i received it ($15 is not even 10% of the purchase price). Bottom line is I would not recommend buying anything from Musicians Friend, and as far as the guitar it self goes, it feels very cheap compared to other guitars in its price range that i have had experience with, the only reason i bought this guitar was for a back - up in case anything happened to my primary guitar. this guitar might also be good for a beginner as well.",1

5529,"It's far better than velcro...it bonds extremely well to most metal surfaces when allowed to cure properly (note: it has to cure 24 hours! If you test it as soon as it's been stuck on, don't complain about bad adhesive). It is resistant to heat, and it keeps the pedals bonded to the board more effectively than velcro. However, jarring can still knock them loose. The hold is not quite as strong as 3M's Dual Lock. But the biggest problem is longevity: if you plan on moving and rearranging your pedals as needs evolve, the little mushroom-shaped hooks will slowly start to get pulled out, significantly weakening the hold over time. This does not happen with the 3M stuff, which is a little cheaper per foot too. I would recommend this over velcro, but the 3M has a stronger hold, is cheaper, and lasts longer.",1
5530,"Very pricey for what is just two pieces of metal (should be prices at $15 for the quality that is given), they have bumps and scratches on them that don't look nice and is put together poorly. With that said it does what it says and looks nice from a distance.",1
5531,"I purchased the HD 300 almost entirely because of the price. Most of the reviews claimed it was a good value and that it was a surprisingly decent pedal. My take on the HD 300 is that you get what you pay for. Pedals are expensive and there are thousands of distortion pedals to choose from. So for $25, I can't say I was that disappointed with the low-quality tone and the amp hum that often occurred. I played a few shows with this pedal, and it worked okay, but after playing around with a few other distortion pedals, I'm a bit embarrassed that I did.

Long story short: great for practice, but if you're going to play live shows, this pedal will let you down. Don't be baited by the low price point and some of the reviews. Spend the extra $20-$30 for a pedal that will last, otherwise you'll end up buying another one anyways. The 3 stars is due to the fact that this pedal is only$25, so if you buy it and don't like it, it's not going to cost you that much.",1

5537,"Humidifiers in wooden stringed instruments are a necessity.  But they're also a pain in the butt....all of 'em.  There's either a sponge (that leaks) or a syringe (that drips) or a container that starts to smell like mildew after a while.  Humidifiers are a necessary evil.

I use Kyser humidifiers because they're the least expensive alternative 'in my experience' to get the job done.  Other humidifiers I've tried (some more expensive) create worse maintenance issue with fluids and their placement. . . .or the prospect of coming loose and bouncing around on braces.  With the Kyser, I can wring it out, dry the plastic and then go through the awkward, flexing and bending gyrations to get it into the sound hole without leakage.  These things could be designed just 1/8"" larger in diameter and it would make a world of difference in installation.  But, they are what they are. . . .3 stars.  Ain't my patent.  'Can't change it.

5542,"I purchased this cable before reading the product reviews, but I later returned here after receiving the item.  I can't personally say anything negative about this cable: it works well as far as I can tell.  However, after reading the negative feedback from other reviewers, I felt compelled to buy a higher quality cable, so I went with LiveWire, which I purchased at a local music store, costing me twice as much as did this one.  Apparently, you shouldn't skimp on your XLR cables--something I didn't know until reading these reviews and searching online.

I give this product three stars simply because it works out of the box, without any noise issues that I can hear.  On the other hand, I can't give it a higher rating because all the negative reviews it has generated here has given me serious doubt about its quality.  I'll probably never use it again and will most likely put it on a shelf.",1
5543,best sticks,1
5544,"I bought this at my local guitar store...not through Amazon. I've probably have purchased 12 of these for my guitars and 1 for my ukulele. Overall, considering all the options - this is still the best in case guitar humidifier. It tells you when to refill it when it shrivels up. Keeps the guitars humidified while in the case closed. It won't work with a gig bag or guitar on your stand...why - I had a GS mini in the gig bag and its too porous so if its in a dry area near a fire place, outside wall, or you live in a desert - it won't work well. All humidifiers depending on the condition may not last long. I still would buy this over others...the humidipaks sometimes have been known to leak in guitars. The planet waves sponges can mold up - both old and new ( I use distilled water in them). If you want this to work well - you need a nice Geib or TKL hardshell case with a seal, not a chip board case.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars - no instructions - once I found out I had to go online or go to the Unofficial Martin Guitar Forum or Acoustic Guitar Forum to learn how to properly prevent leakage. I've had 4 failures of older models. I think the glue was stiff and I left it dry in the summer so the crystals sticking together and causing damage to the membrane will cause failure. I through these out since its cheaper to buy a new one than damage your guitar. Its cheaper to spend 20.00 than repair cracks, polish and crown frets, cleat separations, etc. My smaller body guitars use less than the dreadnough size guitars.

Overall - it's better to have a sponge in your guitar than nothing, but its even better to use the Oasis plus - especially during the winter months in the North with the heat on. I did purchase at EVAP3 Vornado - to complement this humidifier. I bought the GS mini SKB case to rehumidify my travel guitar after I felt some sharp frets due to fretboard shrinkage...after adding this along with the case the GS mini is happy again.",1

5547,"OK, I've been playing harmonica for about 10 years, and have a bunch of harps, but thought I'd give a couple old standbys a try.  I'd say most pro harp players have played them, so this review is just for beginners. First, if you really want to learn how to play harmonica, just buy a decent harmonica in the $25 to $35 range.  Just one, probably in the key of C.  I'd suggest a Honer special 20, Lee Oscar, Herring Blues, or Suzuki blues.  The cheapest harmonica from Honer I'd recommend is a Big River.  They used to be $12 but I think they are a bit higher now.

Of the two ""Old Standby's"" I received (C and A), the A harp was out of tune out of the box on the draw (on the first blow) and also ""rattled"" on the 4 draw.  The C harp was in tune, bent notes easily, didn't leak too much air, and generally is easy to play, and actually is a good beginner harmonica, though not as smooth and nice as a decent Suzuki or Honer.  As a beginner, you probably won't be able to tell if it is the harmonica or your technic that is the problem.  Both harmonicas bent easily.  I opened them both up, and also opened a Honer Bluesband (the cheapest harmonica $5) and the old standby reed plates are exactly the same as the Bluesband.  As a mater of fact, the old standby looks in every way the same as a Bluesband except the name on the coverplates.  So, you could save a couple bucks and just buy a Bluesband (which is the standard beginner harmonica), but they only come in the key of C (though when I started I had one in the key of A, and it actually played real good).  If you are the kind of person that just likes to mess around and try different things and quickly quit (harmonica is actually a difficulty instrument to play well), or if you like to drink a lot of whiskey and blow the harmonica real hard, I'd recommend a bluesband, or one of these old stand by's as a 1st harp, as they are so cheap you can just loose it or throw it away, or blow it out by blowing too hard and then throw it in the trash without loosing much sleep.  If you are serious, and dedicated, and feel like you really want to put a couple years, or the rest of your life into learning how to play harmonica, I'd say just spend the money on a decent harp (probably special 20 to start in the key of C) and you can figure it out on your own from there.

One last thing ... looking at the reed plates, they have all been hand tuned (probably with a Dremel/Foredom type tool with a grinding wheel), including the A harmonica that was out of tune on the draw.  I guess the made in China ones don't have the same quality control, or ear training as the German made ones.  Also note that all of them can be tuned (though very delicate) if you know what you are doing, and made to play just fine.  Lastly, I'll add that one nice thing about the cheaper harps (old standby/bluesband) is that your lips touch plastic, which is soft.  On some of the pro harps, your lips touch brass, and you actually need to take the harp apart, and using very fine sand paper (1000 grit) dull the sharp metal edges or you will waste your lips pretty quick.

5567,"Just downgraded my review from a 5 star to a 3 star. YES, after about two or three uses and it never leaving my living room, one of the zipper fobs came right off. And I am one of those guys who is super careful with his gear. Now it have to live without easy zipping or come up with my own fix. Total manufacturing/design FAIL that should totally embarrass SKB. A company with any pride at all would offer its customers an easy fix and more importantly stop putting a garbage little piece of rubber on an otherwise quality product. I thought maybe the other reviewers got lemons or maybe were just overly rough on the bag; but no sir. They are dead on. Again I am very gentle with all my stuff and the little fob just popped right off (broke) in my hand as easily as a warm knife goes though half melted butter. That said I'll keep and use it because it fits my mixer so well. Frustrating when you just payed for a brand new, name brand item.

My free fix was a little bottle opener key ring a vendor was handing out at Costco a few years ago. Don't know why I let it sit in  a drawer all this time but it came in handy. I wonder how many more of these they'd sell if they just came as a bag + beer bottle opener rather than as a bag with defective zipper pulls?

Otherwise, my initial review was;
It was the best size I could find for my new Soundcraft Signature 10 Mixer. Fits like a glove top to bottom and leaves a couple inches on the side where I'll stash the power cable and maybe a couple other little things. The mixer is wedge shaped so I think I'll add a small towel or piece of bubble wrap to help keep the fader end from flopping around. The fat end is almost snug but not quite. I will still handle with care and not act as if my mixer has high caliber, road worthy protection. The outer pouch is large enough for a few cables, mic, DI, etc...

So short of a custom fit mixer bag or hard case this is a pretty great option for the money imo.

I did not receive anything in exchange for this review and paid full price for the item!

From the moment we got it we've been talking about getting something better - but we haven't, because it would cost much more.  If you can afford a nicer viola, get it.  If not, and you are willing to take this to the local music store and deal with their ""that's why we don't sell cheap stuff"" glare to have the pegs modified, this is an instrument which is more than good enough to get your kid going in Jr. High orchestra until you're sure they will stick with it and you have the cash for something several times more expensive.",1
5574,"Just got this so no long term type of review here...But.... Within an hour of opening the package, I had it set up with one of my personal settings, named and stored. The manual is pretty straight forward, easy to follow.

I've been running my bass thru a Vox ToneLab SE and it was good but it's also made for guitar. With this being dialed in for bass, there wasn't a whole lot of time spent tweaking to get a good sound. I have passive and active basses and both sound good. I run thru a GK with 4X10's and a 15 if that helps you.

I ran it thru the paces, including the looper, overdubs, headphones and drums. Everything's cool. Works just fine. The drum sounds are ""meh"" but that could be a preference thing as I usually mix my own drums. But for just some cool beats to jam to, you're golden.

Everything felt tight. No sloppiness and has a good solid feel. Not something I would expect to take a dump any time soon.
All in all...this is a good stomp box. Built well and fairly intuitive.

EDIT... Having used this for awhile now, I can comment on some long term observations.
My main comment is about the 5 plastic knobs attached to plastic stems for your parameter adjustments. POOR planning on Digitech's part placing them right where your foot is going to be grabbing different channels. No little cage or safety type bar separating them from the foot area. 2 of them knobs are snapped off now I'm stuck with where those parameters were last set. Not impressed with that part.
Downgraded to a 3 star because those are pretty important adjustments that I have no way of changing now. btw... tried super glue. worked for about a week. :(",1
5575,"You can never have too many drawers in your studio and so a Penn Elcom 5 space rack found its way into my old SKB floor rack. After clicking buy at Amazon a huge box appeared on my doorstep two weeks hence. Its a beefy affair of rolled sheet metal so I was surprised it arrived with one of the rack ears bent back about 30 degrees. I considered returning it but was able to bend the ear back with vice grips, albeit still a wee bit deformed, it fit the rack rails okay. Since there was no damage to the box, I can only assume Penn Elcom has some serious quality control issues.

The ball bearing drawer slider is on the stiff and sticky side but hopefully it will loosen up with use. Unlike some rack drawers, it can be opened nearly its full length, allowing storage of larger items. Instead of flush rivets, Penn collected to use screws with nuts and washers that protrude into the drawer interior about 1/4 inch. For mics and cables no problem but it's awkward for storing flat objects like CD cases. Finally, the spring loaded  latch is cheap plastic and bound to break if you close the door without retracting it.

All in all a decent rack drawerdoes what it is supposed to dobut I dinged it a couple stars due to poor quality control and a toy latch design.",1

5577,"I'm going to generously award this three stars, because it is a stand and inexpensive. But I only let others use it these days, because I won't and you'll want to inspect it regularly.

Most will find this adequate for a period of time and then possibly have a reason for wishing that they had never purchased it. It doesn't matter if you own a $150 guitar or a $3500 guitar, you really don't want your stand to fail while your guitar is resting on it and that's what happened to mine.

It really felt too tippy to begin with, but some guitars were worse than others on it. Over time, the cradle bent down and one day I found a guitar on the ground.

A higher quality company like Hercules is a place to start and I've also changed over to the A-frame style like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Stage-Pro-Flip-It/dp/B0002E3DNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Stage Pro Flip It</a>, which is sturdier, has a smaller footprint and packs down smaller. The cost isn't much more and you will have peace of mind and extra convenience for a longer period of time to make up the difference in cost.

Because I purchased this stand 2 years ago, this review could be considered a warning. It cost me a $1200 guitar about a month ago. Now duct tape holds the stand together.",1
5578,"Ehh . . . I wanted to love this. I don't.

The latency is a real problem. I'm running it on a Macbook Pro with a Core Duo 2 and 8GB RAM, and it's bad. When I try to run Logic Pro X, it's hopeless. I actually gave up on that, the latency was so horrible. I will give Fishman credit, they tried to help me over the phone, but their guy said himself he didn't understand why the latency was so bad given my computer set-up, which isn't great, but isn't terrible, either. After two hours on the phone, he basically gave up. I contacted him by email, later, and he didn't respond in any way. For that, I also give Fishman credit, or, rather, blame. This problem should not exist. After all, I can run Logic Pro X with East-West without these latency problems. The install was not done properly by the Fishman authorized dealer, but I was able to bring the pick-up as close as possible to the strings, while the Fishman support tech was on the phone, and that helped. But it did not help enough. Also, the magnets that are supposed to hold the thing on do not hold it on. It falls off. So I guess I'm supposed to get some tape and hold it on with duct tape. Wonderful. A $400 controller that falls off your guitar because of some cheap-assed magnet. Aftermarket might offer something that actually works to hold the thing in place.

The interface is clunky and weird, the documentation extensive but badly written and confusing. Fishman tries to be concise but they are clearly writing for nerds who love to tinker and have already been there, done that a thousand times.

This product has been out two years now, I think, and it still strikes me as not ready for prime time. At this point I'd call it an expensive toy. It probably works better for people who have been running MIDI guitar for the last ten years, which is nice for them. But at this point I would say to anyone contemplating the purchase of this device, please don't. Learn keyboards if you want to sun a synth, and play guitar if you want to play guitar.",1

5580,"These sticks balance well are well crafted and have a tremendous rebound.  The grip really works.  There is only one problem.  If your hands are at all sensitive to vibration, these sticks are not for you.  They transmit huge amounts of vibration to your hand.  This may be in part due to the fact that the handle is lighter than the front of the stick so that a lot of resonance occurs there.  Whatever the cause, although I really like how easy it is to maintain a perfect balance point without slipping, they are very fatiguing. I own all kinds of sticks and the shock transmitted by these is worse than anything I have.  If you wear gloves or have large hands and are a heavy hitter who is immune to shock, go for it, you will lover these.",1

But it makes me nervous with my '73 Gibson Les Paul. The Les Paul is so bottom-heavy that it's too easy to tip the stand and guitar forward, and the pendulum effect of the free-hanging guitar takes over and it all falls forward. (Don't try this at home unless you're standing right there in front ready to stop the pendulum!) In other words, the design of the stand allows the guitar to hang too close to vertical, and if the guitar is extra heavy, it can be tipped forward with a relatively light-to-moderate bump from behind. Front-to-back and side-to-side stability is very good even with the Les Paul and even with pretty solid bumps. I'm no engineer, but I would redesign this stand with four legs, adding a second leg in the back, and increasing the backward tilt of the stand.",1

5586,"Updated Review:

I bought a pair of these bridges for my Squier jazz basses. They are well made and much heavier and more solid than the stock bridge. I've installed both of the bridges and encountered the following notable issues.

1. The screw holes do NOT lineup exactly with the stock bridge. That being said, I still managed to get the bridges installed without drilling new holes. I lined 3 of the holes up exactly and was able to get the outer 2 to screw in.

2. The saddle screws are cheap. With the bass up to pitch, the threads will skip if you tighten them. I had to loosen the strings, taking all tension off the saddle, carefully screw in the screws, then bring the bass back up to pitch. Not ideal, but it works.

Overall I am pleased with the purchase. It's a sub $20 bridge. So if you consider the price it's a great value.",1

I had another looper that was built into a multi effects unit.  Loop time was so short I all but never messed with it but it did not drown out what I was going for after getting a loop going.

5611,"I've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised.  I don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there.  To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic.  Well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack.  It doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine.

THey fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some ""sparkle"".  But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable.  The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to.

The bottom line:  I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't really see them becoming my go-to picks.  I like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations.  I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers.  Worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright.  You know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up.",1

It covers the range from clean to metal distortion pretty well and it's quite loud for a 30 watt solid state amp.  The on board effects are decent.  Now for the disappointing stuff.  The lack of a mids control.  The other ID models have a mids control knob but not the 30.  The crunch channels have a non-adjustable noise gate which kills sustain if turned on and adds a lot off hiss if turned off in the software interface.  The Blackstar Insider software is very buggy and written using software (Silverlight) that Microsoft discontinued in 2012.  The programmable effects are surprisingly limited.  I expected more effects options via the software interface.  Overall, it's not a bad amp for practicing but it has never lived up to my expectations.  There are better choices in this price range.",1

5614,"I directly compared this with a few other spring reverb pedals. This pedals normal signal is worlds above the Boss FRV-1 and most other spring reverb pedals. It sucks tone less and is way more accurate to the sounds of a spring reverb outboard unit. It can even do the semi-distorted tones of '60s Spy music like the old James Bond theme. However, it had a personal deal-breaker: it lacked the watery drip of a reverb unit. When I palm-muted it sounded very digital, almost like a modulation effect was on it (I know about the Easter Egg, this is not it.) Listen to the intro of Esperanza by Dick Dale and you'll know what I mean. To most people this will not matter, but it's a deal-breaker for spring reverb for me. Good pedal otherwise.",1
5615,"It's OK, but if you have the recommended power supply, you cannot fit everything in this case without removing most of the plugs.  Meaning, not everything will be protected as well as it should be because you removed most of the padding.",1
5616,"These are plastic bridge pins and unfortunately, they were too thick for my guitar.  I can't blame the manufacturer for that error but it would be helpful if the thickness was listed on the descriptions.  These can't be shave down to fit due to their being plastic; they become too thin and prone to breaking.  These are your basic plastic bridge pins.",1
5617,"First of this is a very solid and well built head  as any Orange product I have owned or tried over the years and that is extremely important with any product I purchase. That is what my three stars are for which is two thirds of my score.

I come to the conclusion that the Orange sound is not for me as this was my third amp of theirs and naturally from here on is all subjective and opinion based. I like to note this is using two Orange ppc 112 cabinets(I love the cabs however).

 The clean sound on the amp I like with the reverb on but without it is extremely stale and this I find with all their products including the valve or tube based amplifiers. Although I always use reverb in either small or large amounts, still I own better. There are enough options with treble and bass to adjust in my opinion and this coming from being used to only those options.

 The dirty channel was Ok up till halfway maybe just before. I play mainly with a touch if overdrive but I also have high gain amps. The sound above and full blown was atrocious. Never heard such a sloppy sound, extremely muddy no matter the settings. Totally useless to me because of this. I can achieve this sound on most amps if I try to create it with full blown distortion with treble down and bass cranked with guitar tone set to zero. That is consciously trying to create a horrible sound though not while looking for a good one. I have heard people make these sound great, yeah watch the Dave Simpson vids as everyone has read or heard. That's him though and I think there is more than guitar, amp going on as you can edit sounds after the fact regardless what you see.

I even tried various pedals and eq's to adjust the sound but still I was not satisfied. Although I don't play with dirt above half much I want the option.  Keeping this amp as a pedal platform was not worth me hanging on to this and obviously after my review if I was to own one amp this would definitely not be it. Closing my opinion I found this to be the worse the amps I have owned or tried. Again this is a well built piece of equipment and opinions vary, tastes vary etc. We all know this so if you are familiar with the Orange sound and prefer it I recommend this head in it's price range. I also would prefer it over the combo due to transportation and options. Do some research and I hope you are happy no matter the choice. Take care and thank you for reading.",1
5618,ok,1

I was very excited when the case arrived in two days (take that, Musician's Friend), but my joy went to frustration when I went to place my 12 string in the case and it wouldn't fit.  The interior dimensions were too short.  Fortunately, it fit my D-40 like a glove, so it wasn't a total loss, but now I'm still needing a 12 string case.  And that's why I'm only giving it a 3 star review.  If it won't fit all 12 strings, don't sell it as a 12 string case.",1

5629,"If you're looking for a mini amp with quality sound, keep looking.  This is only good for bare-bones quality amplification; there's no bass response, which makes sense because of the tiny speaker.  Don't expect to wow your friends with your killer tone.  Also, if you have a guitar where the jack is on the bottom edge, sitting on a couch or a comfy chair and playing can be a little awkward.  I did get it to feed back with the distortion setting for endless sustain, so that was cool.",1
5630,"Nice instrumpet. Not as resonant as a mountain dulcimer. Set up for right handed ""guitar-like"" use. Replacement strings should be ball end, not the strings recommended as ""buyers often also purchase"" these items. Probably wouldn't recommend.

5634,"I got this to use with my 12 string. It is a huge improvement over my other strap, but it is not as padded as some that you'll pay a higher price for. It does the job, however. For this price you will be satisfied.",1
5635,"These are small and for a tiny mini project studio where you are not really pushing the volume, these are average monitors.  I used these in conjunction with a Focusrite 18i8 sound module and Cubase 4.3 / Windows 7 64 bit.  I have another duplicate setup but also using an older set of EVENT Project 6 reference monitors which I have had for about 14 years now.

I noticed the Rokit 5 distorted somewhat when using just simple DAW virtual instruments.  Also running my POD HD-500, I didn't feel I was getting a truly accurate sound as I have been getting in my Event Project 6 speakers.

Honestly, my gut feeling on these speakers are that they are a step up from Computer speakers but I don't think they have enough drive and speaker size to really handle recording.  Even running the EQ at Flat, I noticed the sound was a bit on the bassy muddy side, but then again, I am comparing these to my trusty Event 6 inch monitors........

Also, there is a power save mode / Idle mode for the built in amp in the speakers and they go to sleep if not used.  During playback you may get a few seconds before they re-engage.  This is not a result of power save modes on my workstation or sound card.  Other's have experienced the same thing.  There does not seem to be a setting to disable this and honestly I am not interested in doing the work internally to these speakers to make it happen, just an annoyance.

I tested the Rockit 5 with simple acoustic guitar recording and again, it was somewhat muddy and I was not sure if I was getting accurate reproduction.  You need flat response to really have a good reference.  Just not sure these size speakers fit the bill. I have since moved these into my office and just made them general computer speakers.",1
5636,"It's OK! Does what it says, no fancy graphics, but very easy to use, it actually came with a CD with 20 demo karaoke songs, quality is decent.",1
5637,"The grip is INCREDIBLE, but they wear SUPER fast. Don't expect to get more than 2 hours of playtime before they are run all the way down.",1
5638,Not what I expected,1
5639,"I received this as a gift and was very eager to test it out.
I must admit, it was difficult to determine how to twist and turn the mic module to correctly capture what was ""in front"" of the mic.
It's easy to get the direction wrong.
The mic seems very fragile due to the way it's constructed. The large dual mic span connected to the larger module by a very narrow plastic cylinder seems to be a break waiting to happen.
The sound: I tried all of the settings and experimented with the convenient level control, and it's a nice leap from the sound I get from the iPhone microphone. It's richer and far clearer.
The unit I received has one flaw (which will prompt a request for an exchange);
When using the module's  headphone jack, I experience a shift between stereo and mono. Continuous clicking and occasional blasts of digital noise.
When playing back my recordings using the native earphone jack, the sound quality of the recordings are just fine. This leads me to believe that the headphone jack is faulity so, I'll go for an exchange and hope doesn't he best.
The exchange should also indicate that, despite the apparent fragility and confusing mic direction, the sound quality is good enough to warrant another chance.
Note: monitoring audio only seemed to work using the ZOOM app. This is a buy if a turn-off as I would have liked to have motioned sound using other apps as well.
So, for now; three stars. I may update after the exchange.
****UPDATE****
Exchange made. Same results.
There appears be something inherently wonky in the headphone jack.
The new unit does the same thing as the old. Clipping, mono to stereo shifting, and a storm of digital noise during playback.
It does RECORD nicely though. Despite the awful monitoring and playback via the iQ7 port, the wave file that is created is really nice. Clean and far superior to the ios microphone.
Too bad the monitor function is not good.",1
5640,"Wouldn't fit either of my guitars. Because the bridge is at an angle, the high e string pin wouldn't fit. It was too close and wouldn't fit. Tried on my Taylor and Alvarez. It did however sound great on the other 5 strings.",1

5646,"So they sound great. If they are long enough for your guitar. They were too short! Sure, I was putting them on a 7 string guitar. I buy six string sets often and they fit just fine and I can wrap it 4 times, at least. 2 of my 7 guitar strings are from a different pack, but those higher 5 strings are very warm and full sounding. Whether playing through amp, or direct in effects, these frozen strings over passive humbucker pickups creates an upper decent sound. I wish they were longer though like what the heck.",1
5647,"These sound great, however the bronze starts to leave a strong metallic aroma on your fingertips after mild use.  The treatment on the strings could be better.",1
5648,"Images were somewhat misleading. They show 2 or maybe 3"" wedges. I received very thin 1"" tiles. Clearly not the same as whats pictured. The description was accurate at the time I purchased these (12""x12""x1""), but I do see that it has changed since, so I am not sure what is going on there. To be fair ,they are far cheaper than any other option I could find though.

Even if the description was accurate, pairing that with an only slightly different image, makes it seem as though I am getting an extra good deal when in fact I am only getting a marginal deal. The only saving grace is that I do need them and they should work ok for high frequency reduction.",1

It does what it's supposed to do. the hinges are kind of akward to reconnect. if you drop the case with pedals inside the corners or edges it lands on will be toast. be sure and stuff a couple inches of low density foam in the lid to hold the pedals against the Velcro, otherwise when you open the case you pedals and the knob settings will all have to be re sorted out... Don't expect an tour able Anvil or Calzone flight case, it's perhaps even below weekend ""country"" amateur level - livewire or skb class of gear. I purchased it to have a light weight enclosure that is less brutal on the interior of my car for local studio/session work.

5659,"This type of capo almost always requires a tuning adjustment when I move it from one position to another on my guitar.  I prefer the Shubb capo, which allows me to adjust the pressure the capo applies against the neck.  That allows me to minimize the need to retune when I change keys.  It's a lot easier and faster to adjust the screw on the Shubb than it is to have to recheck the tuning on each string every time I move a Kyser capo.  Having said that, the Kyser is certainly not the worst I've ever used and being able to clip it to the headstock when not in use is convenient..  I'd take the Shubb any day over it, though.",1
5660,"Nice guitar but I didn't like the neck -- as big and fat as any guitar I've ever played. I thought Alvarez might make a little more trim neck, not just in width, that's not as critical to me as thickness. I was wrong, to me the neck was a tree trunk. I loved everything else about the guitar, I actually considered keeping it and either trying to shave the neck down myself or getting a local luthier to help me.",1

The construction is good, but not great.

It's adjustable and the couplings feel robust, but only just enough.

5665,"This pedal was very cheap and it does provide a chorus effect to my sound, but it definitely leaves you wanting more. If you want a really thick chorus effect, you are likely better off spending the money on something built a little better. The plug for the power is on the side of the right side of the unit, near the audio in, which makes it clumsy in a row of other pedals with a daisy chain power supply (like most musicians use). If you are looking for something that will give you a subtle chorus effect and you're on a budget, this is a good deal.",1
5666,"This is an exceptionally dry head, almost choked. If all my heads were identical, maybe I'd be more okay with it. Make sure that's what you want and imo, no it won't mix well with others in a general kit. If you have a special drum, accent section, then fine. I missed the opportunity to return it, but only because I wanted to like it and live with trying to tune it to make it work.

In that regard, tuning... I have to say, at higher pitches, it really shines, --it gets a nice woody tone, however brief (remember it is dry, not very resonant). It's almost like ""compression"" if you record... it hits it's peak and done, clips off there. However it is much more resonant, sustained at the higher pitches. At lower pitches, and forget floppy heads at all..., it's kinda ugly sounding. But, it is what it is!

So, maybe it is really a 5 Star head... but then, they should really provide Sound Sample Files mp3s and play'em with e.g., their EC2 Coated... (what I have and not, no mixing well).

I have a feeling this may be a good head for a Bass Drum, batter side... then I could remove the silly pillow inside it? Who has the time to switch all these things out and check... just saying, right?

As far as durability goes, -- this thing is going to last. I have actually started to wear off my EC2 Coated coating but, they still sound good. This thing... be ready to live with it or change them out pending the sound of your kit. Actually to spin off the top heads on a four piece isn't that bad. So, we'll see, maybe it'll get some use some day. Otherwise, --I really have to change it out and shelve it.

So, the other reviews that comment, ""to dry for me""... they're not kidding, if even brief in their review.",1
5667,"First I must admit that I really do not like D,Addario strings. The packaging annoys me. Changing strings is always a hassel, because there is no individual packaging. The strings are relatively consistent. They tend to hold up well for a non-coated string. I put these on a 2010 Les Paul Standard Plus, because I could not get the action low enough with 10's. They did the trick. The overall tension and tone made the guitar sing. They do work well....once you get them on!",1

5673,"Didn't work for me.........to shrill and ear piercing.  Tried to break it in.........some amps it's not made to be in.  I was told that before I bought it.  I'm sure it's a great speaker for some amps, just not mine.",1
5674,"Hey, it's a fun little toy, but I've seen this thing going in most places for an even $100 which is ridiculous. I was lucky enough to get it on Amazon for $80. Once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust.  I've made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it's not one of those tools you'll use every song... unless you're so amazing you can make it work every song! Learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun, but once you get it, and you're over it, you wonder why you wasted $100 on something that shouldn't have cost more than $50. It's essentially a 9V battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light. This was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when I had nothing better to use my money on.",1

A friend left her SN-1 clipped to a new ukulele. After a relatively short time, the rubber pad left an obvious mark that couldn't be removed where it came in contact with the headstock.",1
5677,There is really no way to try out a guitar case without actually using it. By the time I decided I wasn't thrilled with this case I just had to kind of stick with it.  The Ovation 8158-0 Acoustic Guitar Case Is a very heavy case.  I do like protecting my  '80 Ovation well but It seems heavier than my friends' cases. This makes me wonder if it is older stock. The guitar barely fits and there is a weird need to make sure she sits exactly flat or the case won;t close. The locks are flimsier than I expected and closing the case needs precise lining up or the locks will not lock. They seem to be slightly out of true. Unfortunately it's taken me a few weeks of using it to discover all this. Doubt it's returnable now. I decided because of the poor construction issues that this is probably a factory 2nd or a knock-off. If I ever need to buy one again I think I will go to the company directly.,1
5678,"Nice unit with some very desirable options (switchable microphones; XLR inputs, phantom power, dual recording).  I really wanted it to work for me and still sorta 'like' it.  It comes with an owner's guide (brief and very tiny font size).  There is a reference manual that is much more readable on the website - but it is for old firmware and MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  Even the name of some functions and displays have changed - and there is no reference manual for the current firmware (v2.0).  (There are some manual updates but they are still well behind the current software.)

I was unable to get several functions to work by just poking around the menu.  Tech support did reply (not very fast) but with very terse and incomplete (and for me - useless) comments (they did admit that one function had been given a new name - without clarifying further).

So beware - unless you are so familiar with recorders that you can read between the (tiny) lines.

I returned mine and got another brand that has a real reference manual available - and I am happy with it.",1
5679,"I've had this guitar for a while, and it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It feels sturdy and holds a tune well.  Packed up in its gig bag, it is pretty compact and easily taken on the road or on an airplane, which is why I got it in the first place.  A lot of creative ideas went into this guitar.

The stethophone is a great idea and works very well.  Though, in practice, I hardly use it.  When in public I feel like I look stupid with it on and would rather have one of the onboard devices on the other traveller guitar models that let me use normal headphones/earbuds.  When in private I just go without or use an external device that lets me plug my earbuds in and listen that way.

The electronics on this guitar seem to work well.  I'll let someone more knowledgable on pickups talk about that part.

The lap rest is good in theory, but in actuality, without an actual body to the guitar to rest against your torso, this guitar is pretty hard to play.  Its just hard to keep in a natural position to play in.  You will definitely want to keep a guitar strap with you to help keep the guitar in a familiar position.  I find that if I forget to bring a strap with me when I travel, I don't really want to even use the guitar just because it's so much harder to play.  Bar chords are much harder to do than a regular guitar because more of the clamping force has to come from the muscle between your thumb and forefinger.  As opposed to a normal body guitar where you can use your bicep to help pull.

This is really the kind of guitar you'll want to try before you buy just to see how much these issues will matter to you personally.  I am thinking of trading in the guitar for one of the electric models that have to full looking body (the escapes or the EG models) but i'll have to test it out to see if it resolves my issues while still being portable enough for air travel.

Changing strings on this guitar can be tricky if you remove all of the strings at once.  Don't do that.  I would only remove 3 strings at most.  The reason is because the wheels that the strings wrap around are held in place by the strings.  So with no strings there the wheels fall out.  Then you have to hold them in place while you try to put that first string on and it's just a pain. If you only do 1-3 strings at a time though, restringing this guitar is just as easy as any other guitar.  There is also a video that Traveler Guitar posted on youtube showing you how to do it properly.

I really respect this company because of the quality of craftsmanship on this guitar and the innovation.  And you cannot beat the portability.",1
5680,"I can't give this guitar 5 stars because it's not a 5 star guitar.  I will give the guitar 4 stars because the price is a very good value.  It is a great beginner guitar.  The price for what you get is an awesome deal and it will let you see if you even want to play an electric guitar.  I drop this package down to 3 stars because the accessories are mostly worthless.

I have always wanted to learn guitar and decided to start here,  Using this guitar with RockSmith, I fell in love with playing and after 3 months upgraded to a higher grade guitar and could instantly tell the difference.

The body is nice and light.  The tuners stay in tune, although one of my tuners is a little iffy and seems to bind at one spot. The pickups sound okay, not great, but okay.  Using Rocksmith to learn, the pickups don't really matter anyway. The pitch pipe tuner is worthless, just throw it away and download a tuning app.  GuitarTuna is a nice little app that I use. The gig bag has almost no padding and a throw away as well. The amp I received with the guitar works.  It is far from good.  I live in an old apartment so I am sure grounding is an issue, but there is plenty of buzz if you turn the volume up at all.  I picked up a decent used amp for $20 off craigslist.

Since the guitar is solidly built to start, I am considering in the future to upgrade the electronics and keep it around.

Final takeaways:  Guitar is a great beginner guitar.  The accessories pack is worth 1 star.",1
5681,"This item is enticing. I have used the Pyle Pro ""Sm57"" clones and I'm happy with them.  I use this as a vocal monitor. Seeing how all other powered monitors that have a 10"" driver are triple the price, I needed something quick so I went with this one for the price ... the sound is about a 6 out of 10.
As with all mid-level monitors, theres a big bump in the mid-range and sounds a little ""boxy"".  There is an onboard Treble / Bass eq which is nice and adequate. There are some cool features on this item but the #1 thing I""m concerned about is sound quality. If the sound quality was just a TAD bit nicer, I'd up-vote this.  If you're doing small gigs and need a monitor on the cheap ... get this. If you're doing this for a living and might use this as a FOH speaker ... I'd go to the local store and take a listen to this first before buying. Its not horrible. Its not stellar like the QSC K10 series.",1
5682,Works pretty good. Lot of feedback however. Use it for Practice.,1

She did and easily has progressed beyond this instrument. So there's good and bad. Good because it's inexpensive and a less expensive way to see if your child will actually play it. Bad because, if they do, they'll outgrow it. This uke is ok but not as nice as you might get by spending a few more $$. The most frustrating part for us is that it simply won't stay in tune. She's constantly retuning this thing. So it's ok, but you can probably also do better. Would consider for a beginner only, however.",1

Very loud amp.
Out of the box had a low frequency hum even without anything plugged in. Next to it I had the Vox AC 15 dead quiet.
Another thing I didn't like is that there is no clean sound at all. I was not expecting a crystal clean but a nice warm tube amp clean and it doesn't have it. Turning gain CCW and the volume CW gives a thin uninspiring clean sound.
The sound in general was nothing to write home about... sent it back after a week and took Rolland JC22. Now - this is a great sounding amp and a pallet for any pedal. Very high quality. Have no regrets returning the Fender though I really wanted to like it and loved the look.",1

5690,"Better posture results in straighter vocal tract and better singing.  Might Dares distributing the guitars weight onto both shoulders help with singing?

When a guitar strap rests on shoulders bony part, the bones support the guitars weight, and player feels comfortable.  If instead, the strap rests on shoulders muscles, these muscles fatigue and further hurt, if the strap has narrower width.

My tests with standard one-shoulder guitar strap  showed:  3 1/4 width woven clothbest, and most expensive.  3 1/4 padded imitation-leather plasticnext best, and moderately priced.  Narrower guitar strapshurts far more, regardless of the price.  Some nylon straps really hurt.

Dare uses two narrow 1 7/8 width nylon strap that rest onto both shoulders muscles near the necka tender part.  Though the guitar weight is distributed onto two shoulders, the two straps' locations on the muscles feel tiring and singing is poorer.  Balancing the straps for optimal weight distribution is also tedious

Now Ill test with different shaped guitars.  A guitar alike a Gibson SG and slightly heavierDare feels OK, but requires constantly balancing the straps.  A heavier Dean ML Modifier--ouch, much more difficult to balance around the neck, and the Dares narrow width dug into my shoulders.  Lastly, onto a lighter weight Dean bass shaped like a Stratocaster-- feels passable

Comfort with Dare depends a lot on the guitar shape and weight.  Dare is also a cheap feeling guitar strap.  Some suggested improvementsmake the strap much wider and use the type of nylon that has some give.

Bottom lineinteresting idea and may help with posture and comfort on certain types of guitars.",1

5696,"This is an exceptionally dry head, almost choked. If all my heads were identical, maybe I'd be more okay with it. Make sure that's what you want and imo, no it won't mix well with others in a general kit. If you have a special drum, accent section, then fine. I missed the opportunity to return it, but only because I wanted to like it and live with trying to tune it to make it work.

In that regard, tuning... I have to say, at higher pitches, it really shines, --it gets a nice woody tone, however brief (remember it is dry, not very resonant). It's almost like ""compression"" if you record... it hits it's peak and done, clips off there. However it is much more resonant, sustained at the higher pitches. At lower pitches, and forget floppy heads at all..., it's kinda ugly sounding. But, it is what it is!

So, maybe it is really a 5 Star head... but then, they should really provide Sound Sample Files mp3s and play'em with e.g., their EC2 Coated... (what I have and not, no mixing well).

I have a feeling this may be a good head for a Bass Drum, batter side... then I could remove the silly pillow inside it? Who has the time to switch all these things out and check... just saying, right?

As far as durability goes, -- this thing is going to last. I have actually started to wear off my EC2 Coated coating but, they still sound good. This thing... be ready to live with it or change them out pending the sound of your kit. Actually to spin off the top heads on a four piece isn't that bad. So, we'll see, maybe it'll get some use some day. Otherwise, --I really have to change it out and shelve it.

So, the other reviews that comment, ""to dry for me""... they're not kidding, if even brief in their review.",1

5701,"Who am I?

I am a street musician. I play steel string acoustic guitar. Big ol' jumbo guitar that I finger pick on. I used this amp for about a year.

What's the deal with this amp? What's to recommend about it?

A. It's loud.
B. It has rechargeable batteries. They hold a long charge.
C. It's simple. On/Off, Volume, Tone, Squeal, Inputs in front and back.
D. It works, mostly.
E. It's compact.
F. At lower volumes the cleans are clean. They will distort when you put the volume knob up, but if you are playing on the street this isn't a huge deal. Precision is less important than volume.
G. I didn't used ""Squeal"" very much, but it sounded fine when I did.

What else is the deal with this amp? What's not so great about it?

A. It's heavy. This is an irritating characteristic, since the point of this amp is its portability. Mind I'm not the strongest person you will ever meet. If you're a strong fellow who doesn't have anything else to carry this may not bother you.
B. Build construction is so-so. The adhesive on one of the cable jacks came undone, some of the wiring was dislodged, I had to take the thing apart and reglue stuff. The caps of two dials also came dislodged. Annoying, but not a huge deal.
C. Rechargeable batteries require regular charging and full use/discharging. This may be inconvenient.
D. There are other amps at this price point worth your attention. I use a Vox DA 5 now which I got for 50 bucks off of craigslist. Previous versions of Roland's Micro Cube can be found on craigslist for 60-80 bucks. These I have not played, but they have a very good reputation.
E. Hiss and hum.

Is it worth purchasing?
Sure, if you get it used or discounted.

Why three stars then?
Because it's an OK amp.

Addendum:

Side by side comparison between the Vox DA 5 and the Pignose Hog 20. Comparison done with an Ibanez EW20ASNT1201 and Seymour Duncan Woody Series SC SA-3SC Single Coil Pickup. Note: I'm not comparing how accurately the amp reproduces my guitar's sound. I'm comparing how things sound within this configuration. This is a personal assessment and should be taken as such.

Clean: Vox and Pignose can both get quite loud without distorting, but Vox stays more consistent as you dial up the volume. Pignose's low end is richer than Vox's. Pignose sounds tighter across the board, Vox sounds warmer.

Overdrive/Distortion: Overdrive on the Vox can be driven up with lots of warm fuzz, Pignose is is much more restrained. You can hear the gain increase on the Pignose, but it's subtle and tight. Vox's overdrive has much more gradation from clean to full overdrive, is warm, is looser. Halfway turned gain dial on the Vox is about the level of distortion/overdrive you'll get on the Pignose with the Squeal dial fully turned. A similar sound to the Pignose Squeal can be reproduced on the Vox by fiddling with the Gain, Volume, Tone, and Effects dials. The Hog 20's reputation is accurate- the Squeal tone sounds suited for blues.

Overdrive and Clean: Vox sounds warmer overall, both on overdrive and clean. Vox has more responsive Tone adjustment. Pignose has richer low tones and tighter overall sound. Pignose is simple, Vox is adjustable, both are loud enough for busking.

Noise: Pignose picks up and amplifies humming/hissing more than Vox. Vox also has humming/hissing, but it's softer at similar volume and gain settings. (Note that the pickup I am using is a single coil cheap-y. It has hum.)

Portability: Vox is 7.72 pounds by spec but my weighing got 8.5. The Hog 20 is 15 pounds by spec, I assume including the power adapter. Without the power adapter I measured about 12 pounds. Vox was weighed without batteries. 6 C batteries weigh just shy of a pound, so expect to add that to overall weight if travelling with this amp. Vox is lighter by several pounds, which can mean a world of difference when you're traveling on foot. Both have carrying straps.",1

Sorry I sound so hard about it, but when you are doing something that may be a once in a life time thing ( wedding, graduation, etc..) you don't want to feel you equipment may fail, even if it is new.",1
5704,"Update: I used it for the second time at rehearsal last night and the height adjustment just won't hold; The cam latch appears defective. I missed Amazon's return window by 2 days, so I would apparently eat the shipping. I've emailed Ultimate Support. If they replace it under warranty, I'll probably just give it away, as I can't stand using it regardless of the defective height cam. I've ordered a third K&M Memphis Pro instead. Further update: Amazon came through promptly authorizing a return after emailing them as well. Ultimate Support customer support also responded very quickly with a suggestion to check that the lever pin was seated evenly (it was), and if not to send them a picture and a copy of my receipt- they would take care of it. It was very reassuring to hear from them so quickly; I emailed K&M about a defective stand a few months back and never heard back from them.

Out of the box, I really like the simple design, easy opening and adjustment, and how compact it folds up. In use, though I find this much more flimsy than two others that I currently have. Every joint has more flex than I'd like. The other two I own have automatic gripping or ""locking"" mechanisms, which I believe are not necessary, given the angle at which the instrument rests (the force required to dislodge any of my instruments from the stand would certainly tip the whole stand over). This one just has an optional rubber strap which cleverly has a tab to hold it out of the way when not in use. I like the design, but for my basses the shape of the yoke doesn't work so well- it holds them fine, the problem is removing them the neck is sort of wedged onto the vee shape of the yoke, so lifting the bass lifts the yoke up too and you kind of have to jerk it free. The height locking cam, while a super simple and clever design doesn't hold very securely. But the joint flexes so much when extended fully to accommodate my 5 string Jazz basses that when I set the bass down, the weight isn't pushing directly down on the lower portion, so it doesn't appear to slip. But the stand is brand new, and I imagine the cam will only get weaker, as it is plastic, and it latches against the metal tube. I'm not sure this is by design or if mine is outside manufacturing tolerances. This and the flimsiness may cause this one to be sent back. I should note, it doesn't appear the flex in all the joints weakens its stability much. In fact it could potentially make it more resistant to tipping. But to me it suggests either poor quality control, poor materials, poor design or corners cut. Edit: given my defective height adjustment cam, much of the flex I noticed could have been a result of that particular defect in mine. Overall, the materials and construction seem well thought out.

I've been on a hanging stand buying spree of sorts lately. In the past month or two, I've picked up this one, plus an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Support-17232-Guitar-Stand/dp/B005L0WZN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Support 17232  Guitar Stand</a>&nbsp;(cheap double stand, sent back, totally unstable with just one bass on it and very cheaply made), two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/K-M-Memphis-Pro-Guitar-Stand/dp/B0016ZT60S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">K & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand</a>s, and one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules-GS414B-A-G-Guitar-Stand/dp/B000EEHKVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules GS414B A/G Guitar Stand</a>. I loved the first K&M, but the second had critical defects out of the box. The Hercules is very good, but is much bulkier than the K&M and Ultimate when folded (not including the non-folding yoke on the Hercules, I'm aware they sell one with that- in this case it is the girth and length of which I speak).

If it weren't for the flimsiness of this compared to the others (Edit: which could be simply due to a faulty height adjustment latch lever), I'd say it is very competitive with the other two- especially considering the price. The K&M is the lightest, most compact when folded, and the most enjoyable to use - however it is somewhat fragile (be careful not to open it too forcefully, or the height stop in the top tube will snap off). This one, the Ultimate GS100 is the second lightest, and almost as small folded as the K&M. I'd really like the way the legs fold on the Ultimate, if the joints didn't flex so much in use. The hanging yoke of the K&M is also my favorite, as the arms rotate inwards with weight applied, basically automatically adjusting for your neck width. For some necks, the Ultimate GS100 yoke may work better than it does for mine. Again, I think a simple yoke is all that is needed for most instruments on this type of stand. The number of moving pieces on the K&M appears much fewer than the Hercules yoke, and the arms of the K&M seem more durable too. The Hercules stand's frame seems the most stout with the least flex, and for mostly stationary use, it might be my favorite of these three. For packing in and out at rehearsal or the gig, the K&M is the winner for me, as it fits the front pocket of my bass gig bags (well 3/4 of the way at least).

Bottom line on this one? Others have had great success with it, but having tried the other two, I can't say I'd recommend it over them. But if saving $10 or so is important, and you don't mind a little flex, or plan to use it with lighter instruments (my heaviest is just shy of 11lbs), this might not be that bad of a choice. It does fold up very nicely- and folds, unfolds very easily.",1

Thought these would be the same size as the single color one I got before, but it is just a little over half the size and the light projected from it is not as wide and not as bright from the same distance. I had to send one of these back because some of the colors were not working. When you pressed a couple of the colors you got a different color and another couple of colors shut it off. The other one works as it should. If the beam was as strong and wide as the single colored one I got before it would be awesome. Add DMX and it would be perfect!

Also the higher value would mean a shorter tuning fork and shorter sustain.

In comparison I have an ""A"" tuning fork that sustains about twice as long this ""C"".  That makes using it a luxurious activity in comparison.  It also cost about three bucks more.  I was attracted to this one based on price so maybe I was overreaching.  Beware!

I have a few tuners in the house so I tested the fork against both of them.  It was right on the money for C and quality tested.

I was just coming back to edit my review and tell everyone what a wonderful seller this is and how I would be returning for all my string needs, when I receive and email saying that I am supposed to return the the 'old set' the one with the snapped string. This is not what we discussed via emails. Your offer was to replace the fouled set free of charge and that I did NOT have to return the broken set.
So please, get this straight for me. Am I supposed to send the broken set back now? You've changed your mind after almost a month?
If this is some kind of stupid auto-response email, I'll be more than happy to come back and edit this again.
I'm only contacting you this way, because not matter how I look thru my order, I cannot find a way just to contact you.",1
5755,good,1
5756,"I only rated these a 3, because I thought these were the same Fender/CTS pots that had solder already applied to the back to help make solder ground wires a lot easier. I had a hard time getting the silver solder I was using to stay put to the backs of these. I was using a 40w soldering iron, and had to hold the iron to the pots for way too long to get the solder to stick. (I suppose I could have tried sanding the backs, but didn't feel I should have had to.)
But once I got it all done, they really work like they are supposed to, unlike the OE Squier pots that were just like on/off knobs.
If you replace all the electricals in your guitar like I did, you might look for the kits. After I ordered everything separate, I then realized Amazon offers kits with all pieces, and with different choices of capacitor values.
Or... make sure you look for the CTS pots that have a small coating of solder on the backs already!",1
5757,"Fine for a kid or for learning, but the sounds are really grating and will often sound out of tune when you play a chorus. Stand is really wobbly.",1
5758,Tom but no roto...,1
5759,"Way over Hyped and over priced. The on off button is a pain in the butt. I cant turn it on or off while it is clamped onto guitar, it has to be removed to turn it on and removed to turn it off. It tunes very well but with all the hype I was expecting less annoyances.",1
5760,"One of the frets was too low, causing the strings to rattle. I had to send it back for a replacement. All the other Mahalo ukes I ordered have arrived fine.",1
5761,"This case seems pretty solid. Its great looking. All the latches work good, the one that locks doesnt snap down real tight but its not loose enough to unlatch be itself. The magenta interior is great.  I bought this for an Epi Les Paul custom but it really doesnt fit well. The LP is going to move around in the case and the great looks are not the mail reason I bought a case. Its just not a very snug fit.  I will be sending this one back and purchasing the Epi LP case. This is probably a one case fits many so not the perfect fit in this situation. I also put my Gibson Les Paul Special in it. The fit is worse. See pictures that show the space around the guitars.",1
5762,"Key of G is slightly off pitch, I don't  use it that much when I perform . I have 2 guitars so I make sure that one guitar is turned to the harp. I guess I would have to spend more money if I want a Harmonica that is in perfect pitch.",1
5763,Fit the bill,1
5764,"This is a pretty simple item and works well on the proper diameter of tube on a mic stand. If the diameter is too small the pick won't stay in and if its too large the picks are very tight. It works ok, but I probably won't buy another.",1
5765,"it works.  with the shape of the tool, rotating the string winder feels ""floppy"", flimsy, off-center, unbalanced, etc to me.

decent product if you're on the go and want a multi-tool-in-one for string changes.

If you're gonna primarily be working somewhere more stationary (eg: workbench at home/work), a regular string winder and some wire cutters will do.

nothing really special with this one.",1
5766,"I have owned this preamp for a couple years. I've recorded a lot of tracks through it- vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, even drums. I've changed the tube a couple of times (easy enough if you're careful and very gentle with the innards) and while I don't really have too many complaints, I also don't really think it's that great.

Pros:
-Cheap in price but not terribly made
-fairly sturdy
-VU meters look old-school
-decent amounts of (relatively noisy) gain
-portable and small enough to tuck into a corner of your desk or into a half-rack slot
-Sounds ok on most things (oddly my favorite use is micing hi-hat using really awful B8 cymbals. Sounds rad, for some reason).

Cons:
-even with nice, NOS tube it still breaks up really early and the distortion isn't all that musical
-noisy when you start to crank the gain or output past about 1 o'clock
-no on/off switch

I think if you've been using the stock preamps on a cheaper interface you'd be happy with this, but then I would also prefer the preamps in my old Behringer Eurorack mixer to these so... I don't know. If you've never owned a pre before, or you like experimenting with weird gain, go for it. Honestly, though, I'd just spend a few extra bucks and get something nicer like a Golden Age Jr  or, if you can find one used (yeah right) get the Warm WA12. 170$ more, no tubes, but a thousand times better.",1
5767,"I've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised.  I don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there to a small degree.  To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic.  Well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack.  It doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine. I wouldn't want it to be my everyday acoustic tone, though.

THey fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some ""sparkle"".  But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable.  The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to.

The bottom line:  I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't really see them becoming my go-to picks.  I like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations.  I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers.  Worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright.  You know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up.",1
5768,"Great volume, but poor sound reproduction on the high end.",1
5769,"This is my 4th ChromaCast bag. I fell in love with this brand based on roominess, good value, and clever design, after discovering that their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ChromaCast-CC-AJPB-BAG-Jumbo-Gig-Bag/dp/B013J6IFNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ChromaCast CC-AJPB-BAG Jumbo Gig Bag</a>&nbsp;was long enough to hold my 12-string acoustic dreadnought. Their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ChromaCast-CC-BPB-BAG-Electric-Bass-Guitar-Padded-Gig-Bag/dp/B00CKYVW2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ChromaCast CC-BPB-BAG Electric Bass Guitar Padded Gig Bag</a>&nbsp;is, similarly, roomy enough to easily fit my 5-string bass (with extra space left around the large peghead).

This particular bag, however, is surprisingly short. It's about 1/2"" too short to fit my Telecaster's peghead. (I could get the bag to close by stretching its top around the peghead's tip, but that's not good for the guitar, bag, or zipper.) I actually wouldn't recommend it for any guitar with a Fender-style 6-in-a-row peghead.

This is too bad, because it has some nice features. The lower outside pocket is HUGE  why aren't other gig bags designed this way?  but lower-profile than the smaller/deeper compound pockets on standard ChromaCast bags. The graphics are...interesting. Like all ChromaCast bags, it's well-designed: It has serviceable backpack straps, the twin side handles are stitched to wide web straps that keep all stress off the zipper, and your guitar rests against padded fabric (not zippers) on all sides.

This does comfortably fit my ESP/Ltd Les Paul copy. It's probably fine for most solidbody electrics with 3-on-a-side pegheads. I just wish ChromaCast would redesign it to fit as generously as its other bags.

And I still give this whole ChromaCast series a 5+ for value, 4+ for features/design, and maybe 3.5 to 4 for padding/build quality. The latter aren't robust enough for gigging musicians who have serious needs to transport valuable instruments in iffy conditions. (For that, your best bet is to look for a used PRS SE gig bag  they're almost indestructible.) But these are probably the best value around in a basic bag, that's comfortable and provides ample pocket space for accessories.",1
5770,"The unit worked great for a while then just ceased operating properly. The display went haywire and I could not long use.
Seller accepted the return. I replaced it with a Turbo Tuner ST-200. My main use of the Tru-Strobe was for setting intonation.",1
5771,"Well, I have now had this tuner for over a year. It worked great until recently. I can turn it on, but it turns itself off within seconds. The battery is new so that's not an issue. I found that in order to keep it working, I have to apply pressure to the top of the tuner(down on to the headstock). Not really a good fix. Back to the pedal type I guess.",1
5772,"I want to love this recorder, but only like it. For my own experience with it, the pre-amp or converters it uses are noisy, and to record professionally with this unit, you need to cleanly boost the signal going into it, For instance, if you try to record a relatively quiet sound such as foot steps, without a pre-amp boost, you will have to turn up the gain on this unit and that will create excessive noise into the recording. If the sounds you are recording are relatively loud, then you should be okay with this alone. I don't like that when you detach the microphone, the electronic connection to the unit is left exposed. That seems like a real design shortcoming to me. My other issue is the display panel is really small and very difficult to read in certain situations. If you are serious about getting quality sound, you might want to look at the Roland R-26. It is more expensive than this unit, but it seems to have a lower noise floor and the display system is so much better than the Zoom. It costs a little more, but as they say, you often get what you pay for. One little quirky thing about the unit is when you use the Mono Mix setting, which splits one XLR input onto both channels, the readout tops out at -6 dB and not 0. This is explained no where in the documentation. I had to contact Zoom directly to learn about this.  Not sure why they programmed it like that. These are good units for the price point, but you really do need a pre-amp for this recorder to function in all situations. The Azden FMX-22 or the Sound Devices MM-1 are both good with this. Those pre-amps put out at line level, so you have to adjust the  H5 to -20 dB to handle the pre-amp. Not a big deal.",1
5773,"If you want a good 'amp' to practice silently,then this will get the job done.  Overall, it sounds good, not great.  Turning the tone or the volume down to zero makes it silent, which is annoying.  I got this for practicing late at night and not annoy everyone around me, and for taking with to check out used guitars.  I have since replaced it with a Tascam GB-10 guitar recorder/trainer which does the first much better, and the latter as well.  It wasn't much more.",1
5774,"These strings are different than I expected.  They are very good quality strings but they are not just typical ""light guage"" strings with a bolder/High Definition sound.  They are noticably heavier than the ""custom lights"" I am used to playing on my acoustic guitars.  They sound good if you can handle the heavier feel.",1
5775,"It sounds good, but hurts my hand to use for a minute. I'd love if they turned the handle, so it was on a flat plane with the rest of the jingles and everything. Then, it would be natural to hold it outward. I'm gonna pad it with some clothe and tape it around. Should help.",1

I chose these because I ""thought"" I was doing my part to buy ""Made in the USA"" products.  So, in conclusion these are ""NOT"" CBI cables, and they are ""Made in China"".  On a positive note, they work, the cable is soft and flimsy, and the connectors are low quality, there is no writing or identifying information on either the jacket or the connectors.",1

I don't like the case putting pressure on that point of my nice acoustic guitar, but there's enough padding that it works.  Given that it only holds 8 medium picks (which is plenty for most gigs), it should be lower profile.",1

I was attracted to the ME-80 by its positive reviews and its appealing form factor..Unfortunately, I found that this unit tries to do way too much, to the detriment of the basics. To my ear, none of the core effects - particularly the distortion modes and reverb (one knob for all parameters!?) - sounded as good as the corresponding stand-alone Boss pedals. I returned it the next day, and went back to my pedal board with newfound respect.",1
5795,"They wear away to nothing quickly 1-2 hrs in my experience, If you're looking for thicker picks I recommend wooden picks.",1
5796,Never used the metronome function but the tension on the spring faded pretty quickly.  Made the tuner less accurate and useful than it should have been faster than it should have.  Would I buy again?  No.  I downloaded a free telephone app that works better than this but that is only because I do not tune my guitar in public with background noise.  These are made for when you need to tune via vibration mostly.  I have to imagine there are better ones out there for the use I got out of two of these.  Always got to try things twice before making a conclusion you know.,1
5797,"This pedal would be a great solution for anyone wanting a fairly generic metal tone. Couldn't do much with it that other pedals on my board couldn't already do. Nothing wrong with the pedal, it simply wasn't unique enough to justify keeping on the board. Returning.",1

The pedal itself is alright, nothing crazy about it.
I've been using a Dunlop rotovibe pedal for years and absolutely love that thing.
 I bought this univibe hoping to get the same sound in a smaller encloser. Needless to say the univibe just doesn't measure up.
Rotovibe has a much wider sweep effect and its a lot cleaner sounding, more clear.
The univibe is very bass heavy and muffled, Especially  when used along side a OD or fuzz pedal. I was tweaking the knobs for a while but just couldn't dial in the sound I wanted.
I even hooked it up next to my rotovibe for comparison.

I had high hopes for the univibe. It's not a bad pedal, just didn't have the sounds I was looking for.",1

After I did all those repairs, I had to replace the strings (just can't use the same strings again) and had to do an adjustment to the neck-bridge, was glad that it came with the adjusting tool. I don't think that they checked this guitar before sending it out to me, mine in particular...its sad!",1
5805,"Let's all just cool our jets a bit here. The Fly 3 is a nice little toy, but it's not some magical tone machine shrunk into an impossibly tiny package. Blackstar is a great brand, I've owned 2 other of their practice amps (HT1 and HT1-RH) both are fantastic. The Fly 3 was something I had to have!

First off, it's hard to tell, but it's all plastic. That's par for the course with these micro amps but I was hoping for a little better from Blackstar. Orange makes one that, at least feels substantial. Plastic puts it firmly in the toy category for me. The sound is decent, I usually just crank up the overdrive and bang away. It's a bit tinny but, again, that's to be expected from such a little amp. The delay effect isn't something you find on tiny amps like this, so that's a plus. Anyway, I'm not going to waste my time breaking down the nuances of the tone here, I'll just bottom line it.

The Fly3 is an above average plastic battery powered micro amp. I don't really think it quite lives up to the Blackstar name, but that's just my opinion. You're not going to plug it in and go play arenas like a lot of these reviews seem to suggest, It's really more of a toy. I bought it, played with it and already sold it to somebody else. If you want a Blackstar amp, I recommend spending a bit more and getting a real one.",1
5806,"I did not really know what to expect. For the price, I was expecting at least a little padding but there is none whatsoever. Since I am not using it for any heavy duty transport, I guess it will work but it is nothing special.  It is definitely economy and the stitching is a little funky. It's basically a tote bag, you know one of those cheap nylon bags did you get at the grocery store or department store , But it is sized to fit a 16 inch frame drum. I'm just using it to protect the drum from little fingers.  Not much, it is basically a tote bag for your drum.",1
5807,"There is actually nothing wrong with the construction of these beaters. They are well made and will likely stand up to many years of use. Also they produce exactly the sound you would expect. They produce a very nice sharp and strong attack. The issue I have with them is that they are heavy. It is something I hadn't thought of when ordering. For some that may be a positive but for me I have found my pedals to be much more sluggish and less responsive. This I believe is 100% due to their extra weight at the beater compared to plastic and felt beaters. If you are looking for a beater with lots of cutting attack that is also heavier than a plastic or felt beater these my be exactly what you want. For me though, they are just too heavy.",1
5808,The product is a great idea but needs work. I bought it for my quinto but it doesn't work at all for that. It does work on the conga but fits very loose. I have pro LP congas. I will have to put rubber feet if possible on the inside of the product so it stays and is less wobbly. The conga sounds great elevated but I'm pretty disappointed overall. They need to improve this one. I'm still keeping it.,1
5809,it doesn't always work,1

5811,"You get what you pay for is the old saying.  They came in all smashed together.  Some of them are well constructed and some of them are very thin in places.  No consistency in construction apparently.  Also, the darker ones faded onto the lighter ones so now they have a tie dye effect but only in some spots.  I got these for company use and that doesn't look very professional.  I also tore a chunk out of the blue one trying to get it on over the mic head.",1
5812,"These are good strings but sounded too dark on my Taylor dreadnought, I wonder if the coating is reducing the volume of the pick attack. I much preferred the D'addario 80/20 which are brighter and more articulate. I'm sure they will sound different on another guitar, buy a single set and try them out first!",1
5813,"These headphones are very clean.  Highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion.  However, the low end response is not so good.  At normal listening levels, I would like a lot more bass response and it's not there.  If you crank up the volume, then the bass starts coming in.  But I don't listen to music that way.
Hope this helps in making a decision.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought something different.",1
5814,"This is a pretty unique delay/verb, especially coming from Boss. It looks like a DD whatever, but it lacks the conventional bread and butter digital delay stuff. What it is perfect for is drones, post-rock, spacey ambience, etc. The Pro Guitar Shop demo for this features some OK Computer-type playing which was a great choice- it's definitely suitable for that kind of ambience, although it doesn't really sound vintage per se. There's an envelope-filtered element to the sound which I quite dislike, thankfully it can be dialed out, but by doing so you're pretty much relegating this to ambient uses. The runaway feedback on this is really intense. There's also a hold feature, kind of like the EHX Freeze pedal. This is good but because of the way it activates, it's hard to trigger it at a precise moment. Used this on guitar and plenty on analog synth where it really shines.

This is probably one of the most one-trick pony pedals Boss has ever made, which is why I would say it's quite overpriced at $180. If you're really into shoegaze and post-rock and have an obscene pedalboard it would be a nice addition.",1

5817,"I've had my 640 for about a month, not totally happy with this Yamaha offering. I read numerous reviews and obviously no one mentioned the following - The ""awesome, real piano sounds"" mmmm, all the Grand Piano ""voices"" above middle C sounded like steel drums (using the built-in speakers or amplification) I tried to adjust the sound with the various- DSP, Harmony, Reverb setting (which is a pain) - I spent endless hours trying to get the 640 to sound somewhat like a Grand Piano, in the end  I settled for the E.Piano offering.
The buttons on the keyboard - intro/ending button and the Auto-fill button are right next to each other, not good. I can't tell you how many times I tried to change the ""auto-fill"" while playing and reading, and accidentally hitting the wrong button thus ending the song. The ""Weighted Keys"" again mmmm, are noisy, no matter what setting you're at (3 settings)but are acceptable compared to other synth. type keys
The unit has one auto-intro/ending style - no matter what tempo or style you're playing - it has this cheesy ending, no auto fade which would be a lot better, and more useful. Come on Yamaha, don't give me the excuse about price points etc - replace the auto ending with auto fade. In retrospect I should have looked at other Piano Manftrs. My last 3 keyboards have been Yamaha and I own a 309 Clavinova (great machine) I bought the DGX 640 for mobility and being able to swap Midi files between the units- that didn't work as the ""voices"" sound almost totally different even though the have the same name. I suspect Yamaha WILL change the button positions - they did this with the Clavinova model, and make some other necessary common-sense design adjustments. I'm surprised to see Yamaha who have all this experience making such basic errors, who test drove this unit? Don't get taken in with the Yamaha Marketing - all these guys on YOUTUBE demo-ing the unit etc. Paul Barrtmans or who ever, take it from someone who uses it daily -(or not) make you're own mind up based on functionality - don't get caught-up in the ""nice new unit"" and the sales pitch.- play with the unit for awhile BEFORE considering purchase.

5822,"My revised review (after about a year of use):
The one thing I hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out, so if you're not careful, your guitar will fall. It is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap, once every few days.

My original review:
Very easy to install; didn't require drilling. I have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes. Although it looks a little bit big and clunky, it's a small price to pay for stability. I probably will get another set, but may get the black ones instead of the silver because I think the black color may hide the ""clunkyness"" a little better. Overall, a very good product.",1

5825,"Lots of great features and excellent sounds. This is a decent keyboard, but there are some things to keep in mind: 1. Even if you are a beginner, you might soon get frustrated with the limited amount of keys on this instrument. I'd say get a keyboard with at least 76 keys. And if you are serious about playing classical, and/or taking piano lessons, either buy a piano or a keyboard with weighted keys (which are quite different from touch-sensitive keys) and one that has the full 88 keys. Unfortunately, keyboards with these features, with the exception of one or two models made by Williams, are more expensive. Sorry, I don't know if those Williams keyboards are very good, I've just played on some in a store.

Secondly, lighted keys are a bad idea. If you are focusing on and playing the keys as they light up, you might as well be playing a video game like Rock Band or Guitar Hero.

Why? If you are watching and playing the lighted keys, you are not learning what notes the keys are, and you are not learning how to read music. The notes do show up on the display at the center of the keyboard, but it is kinda tough to watch the display and also the keys as they light up. Trying to learn with the lit keys feature, in my opinion, will actually slow your growth as a musician, not speed up your improvement.

If you don't need a keyboard with 88 weighted keys, and want a good synth, I'd say go for the Yamaha PSREW300AD 76-Key Portable Keyboard & Power Supply (if one is sold with portable power supply). If you buy that one, and have an ipad or iphone (the Yamaha apps are not available for other phones and tablets as of yet, but maybe, by the time you read the review, they will be), make sure to download the Yamaha app that is a virtual pitch bender and modulation wheel. These features are not on the keyboard, but the app works. Strangely, I just found that sound controller listed under ""iphone apps,"" not ""ipad apps,"" but I was still able to download it to my ipad.

The PSREW model I just mentioned does not have lighted keys, has 76 keys, and has more and better features. It doesn't cost much more than this model. Watch the demo on youtube. Pretty cool.

Thirdly, the display on this keyboard is not backlit, and is therefore not easy to see unless you are somewhere with good lighting. The keyboard I just mentioned does have a backlit display that is easier to see.

Lastly, this model, as of 1/15/18, when I am writing this review, is not sold with a power supply in the box. You'll have to buy one extra.

Some other things I just thought of.. the ""survival kit"" that is often sold as part of a bundle is not worth buying. The headphones are terrible, the expression pedal is really really tiny, and there's a bunch of offers for online programs which you may or may not be interested in. Better to buy a full size sustain pedal and a power supply separately. Skip the survival kit.

And keyboard stands.. X-brace stands, whether single or double braced, are wobbly. Z stands are not wobbly, but might not be adjustable high enough to make playing standing up comfortable, depending on your height.

Hope this info helps.",1

The leather is thick which is nice, but it's also so thick that it doesn't fit under the guitar strings on my guitar so I can't even use it on the guitar I was hoping to. So, there's that.",1

5833,"I give this three stars, but have only a few complaints. First off, as others have said, buy replacement tubes right away. I biased the amp when I got it and used the tubes it came with for a while, and they never failed. But after changeing the tubes out, this beast came alive! I had been using the amp for a year and a half every weekend with no problems. In my opinion, this is a great sounding amp. The downside is the quality of the amp. The pots and some of the components are a little cheesy. I had problems with the rhythm pot, which was replaced. All amps at some point may need repair or service, but I could see these needing more than others. Overall I think this is a great sounding and performing amp when biased correctly and re-tubed. Just be nice to it and treat it like its cheap, because it is. If you do those things I think you'll love this amp, but if you can, save some bucks and get another amp or the new version of this one.",1
5834,"this switch does what it is supposed to do, but for about 7 dollars in parts I could have built my own.  The only issue with this device is the high price to value ratio.

I will most likely keep it, but just thought folks should known that this item is mostly a whistle in the world of bells and whistles.",1
5835,"I have three of these, and they seem to work well in standalone mode, but I haven't tested them with DMX until last week.  What I found was that the DMX control does NOT work!  There is NO response at all to DMX control.  NOTHING.  (I have a couple of years experience with DMX and have several other DMX lights that work perfectly, so it's not my controller/cabling setup.)

And as others have noted, they are cheaply made (but for less than $20, what do you expect?)  They have no power switch, the only way to turn them off is to un-plug them.  They are a bit on the loud side too - since they have a cooling fan.

All that aside, they do produce a nice effect, but I wish the DMX control worked.",1

5842,"seem to be well made, but that don't attach as well as I would wish they keep popping off the guitar",1
5843,"In fairness, the strings themselves are functionally fine.  AND I put them on a 7/8ths (GS Mini) guitar which, by the very nature of its scale length, has lower tension to begin with.  So the 3 starts is more about the entire picture, not the strings in isolation.  But that's fair - strings in isolation don't produce music.

Here's the rub: these are lower tension strings, right?  So your truss rod has to do less work, right?  I lost quite a bit of neck relief (actually, all of it) when installing these strings.  It took about 3/4 a turn (which is a lot on a truss rod) to get back to .007"" relief.

Now my intonation is slightly off (which makes no sense given how little neck relief I have).  Before these strings I had everything on this guitar dialed-in.  I could capo at the 5th with no pitch issues.

But hey, maybe I stink as a luthier.  Maybe your guitar is better.  I don't know.  I just know I wish I'd never installed these strings.  I'll go back to the OEM Elixirs the next time I place an Amazon order.  But since I went through all this trouble I'll play them for a while.  Why not?

Tone, playability, quality... it's all good.  It's just not as significant as expected.  In fact, the only significant difference was how the strings didn't pop out and attack you when released from the bondage of their packaging.  I kinda' missed the booby-trapped violence of opening guitar strings.

I think it's your playing a full scale robust instrument with high-ish action that needs some taming (like a big 'ole full scale jumbo) then definitely give these a shot.  Just order a set of regular strings too in case your guitar gets whacked out of shape.  Or call your buddy who knows how to set-up a guitar and buy him/her a 6 pack.",1
5844,"This set is really good for the price and I definitely love playing on it, I've added a Meinl 14 Soundcaster Fusion Crash, 10 HCS splash and HCS 20 Ride. And replaced the bass drum with an Orange County bass drum, and gotta say, it's looking good. But one problem, I went to go record, and I hooked my Pyle set to everything, and well, the drums vibrated the hell out of my mics, and the sound was unpleasant. Definitely just gonna replace the drums with some Pulse and Yamahas. The cymbals are another story, the crash-ride simply is like punching a brick wall, and the hi hat, well that dented in matter of weeks. I recommend this set for only a practice!",1

But the important thing to remember is what are YOU using them for. I have worked in a lot of different ""professional"" studios, but I use these in my home studio which is in just a small extra bedroom. They do a decent job of eliminating reflection and fine for my purpose of recording, mixing, and mastering for myself, friends and other independent artists. I would not recommend to anyone who is a total sound freak or audiophile. If you really just want to make music, these are definitely the cheapest panels you'll find (unless you make your own).",1

These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.

This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs, but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure, true bypass, sturdier inputs and knobs, and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem.",1

Unfortunately that's not the case here.",1
5866,These are totally usable if you don't mind not stretching your legs all the way or raising your speaker stands all the way.  My typical configuration uses the Ultimate pneumatic stands and thus I always raise my speakers all the way and keep my legs spread out to do that.

I still have uses for this with some of my other stands so it's usable but not totally what I was expecting.,1

Somewhat flimsy, overly thick corks, and OK tone quality. Don't get me wrong, they will do the job for a middle school band or any intermediate trumpet player. However, if you are a more serious trumpet player, spend the extra money and get any of the quality metal straight mutes (Jo Ral and Denis Wick are excellent). If you do buy this, you will most likely need to file the corks down to get a good fit in your bell. Otherwise, the mute easily falls out and does not provide enough of a ""straight mute"" sound.",1
5868,Ok,1
5869,"This review is for the Fulltone OCD v. 2, which is the latest iteration of this pedal.

This pedal is built like a tank and appears to have quality components but can sound abrasive as a stand-alone overdrive.  There's a toggle switch at the top of the pedal for HP (high peak) and LP (low peak).  I've been able to get tones that I somewhat like in the LP mode.  HP is just way too bright and has significantly more presence and output than LP (which is not necessarily a good thing unless your signal is already compressed to a large degree).  I play through a Fender 1968 Custom Deluxe Reverb amp and have found this pedal sounds better to my ears when paired with an Ibanez Tubescreamer Mini to bring out some of the mids while using a little compression for added squish and sustain (both placed before the OCD in the signal chain).

After noticing a slight buzzing sound coming out of my amp with all my pedals bypassed, I went on a troubleshooting mission.  Guitar straight into the amp: clear as a bell, no buzz.  After disconnecting and reconnecting each of my pedals in my signal chain, I determined it was the Fulltone OCD pedal causing the unwanted buzz.  The fix: opening it up and switching it to true bypass mode from the factory set enhanced bypass mode.  Voila!  No more buzz.  There's certainly been a lot of buzz about this new type of bypass created by Mike Fuller of Fulltone.  I didn't realize it was literal buzz.

My setup: guitar into a Fulltone Clyde Deluxe Wah, MXR Dynacomp, MXR Echoplex preamp, MXR Univibe, MXR Analog Chorus, MXR Script Phase 90, EVH Flanger, Ibanez Tubescreamer Mini, Fulltone OCD, MXR Zakk Wylde Overdrive, MXR Carbon Copy analog delay, into the amp (yes, I like MXR pedals; just my preference).  I use a Pedaltrain Pro pedal board and all the pedals are connected with Mogami patch cables powered by a Voodoo Lab power brickand three 9V AC adapters.

Is there some tone loss after the signal passes through all the cables and patch cables?  A little, yes.  Nothing ever sounds as pure and good as going straight into the amp.  Am I 100% certain the buzzing noise was caused by the OCD pedal in enhanced bypass mode?  Not entirely, but this appeared to be the case with my rig.

Conclusion: this is a solid drive pedal that does a decent job emulating a broken up tube ampat volumes that won't cause you to go deaf.  Four stars for the pedal itself and two stars for the frustration related to the enhanced bypass garbage that made me pull out more hair from my balding head.",1
5870,"I have been using these strings on one of my Alvarez Yairis (DY71). The guitar is naturally warm and doesn't project quite as well as my DY77 and the these strings help with tone and projection. They sound amazing.  But the best price on these strings these days is $12 ($15 at the big box guitar store).  Not so bad IF they prolong the life of the string.  And they may if you play A LOT.  But they go dead just sitting in a case as well as hard playing.

I gave it three stars because of the price. The uncoated 4100 strings are the same strings, uncoated (according to Martin) at half the price.  $6 for coating?  I don't think so. As others have pointed out, unlike the other brand of coated string, the coating does not add to the slinkiness of the string.  If slinkiness is required then the simple solution is to use a product like Finger Ease which will work just as well on non coated strings, so why pay the extra money for the 7100s. Just sayin'. In full disclosure I have not tried the 4100's yet, but will do so next change and will edit my review if they are radically different sounding than the 7100's.

But again, on my guitar the SP 7100 strings sound amazing.",1

Fabulous bling for any guitar that you don't intend to platy regularly. The finish can remove offer a fairly short period of picking and only in that area of the string. Also during installation where you need to pass through locking nut assemblies, be very careful since and abrasive contact will also remove the coveted hues. The lighter colors like white are much more tolerant and overall the string sets sound is pretty engaging offering a well balanced and harmonically intriguing soundscape. Buy two since any mishap and you will need a backup[ set to fill in the blanks. Also for tremolos ""just say no"" since these can unwind both at the locking tuner end or the string saddle end (not the locking nut but they can scratch there). This unwrapping issue is super annoying characteristic.

Overall, for wall art yes, for working axe no. Still want color? Buy more sets and change them as required. The look is timeless but the durability of the color tone leaves much to be desired.",1
5876,Risky. Ends are such that they could scratch certain guitars.,1

5878,"What this unit is: a fun piece of kit that you can use to mess around with and effect audio.  What it's not: a serious piece of DJ performance kit.

First, the fun.  It's good for real time tweaking.  It sounds great.  It's easy to get started with the unit and get some cool sounds quickly.  Having four independent effects is fun, and can be a little more creative than just using presets.

Why it's not a serious piece of DJ Kit.  No sampler.  No Midi.  No ability to save settings. Plastic build.  BPM Detect is questionable.  Some of the FX groupings seem arbitrary, and it would be nice to assign effects to banks so you could have more flexibility.

Conclusion: It's fun.  If you've got $300 to spend on adding some highly tweakable, easy to apply effects to your audio, this could be a good purchase.  If you're looking for a serious piece of kit that you can build repeatable sets from, you may want to look elsewhere (say, maybe a KP3).",1

5882,"I wanted to like this but sent it back. I like the LED display, and being able to visually see where you are in the loop, and the fact that it can be stereo as well. But, trying to get things to loop tightly, without any gaps, without truncating the initial attack of the first transient in the loop... was just too much of a pain. I admit, I am very particular about that, OCD about it even. I'm a producer so I'm used to working in a DAW and things loop perfect.

It will probably work for you, but I'm going with something else. The pedal is good old fashioned BOSS firm, built very solid, and as such it requires more pressure when you stomp on it than say a TC Electronics Ditto where the stomp switch doesn't click, it just gives smoothly. I just got an Electro Harmonix Canyon Delay and Looper and I can get much, much tighter loops on that even. I gave it 3 stars cause the design is good, the functionality, overdubbing, time length, ease of use, and build quality is all there, plus its red.. but I docked 2 stars because the stiff pedal made it too difficult for me to get tight loops out of it, plus with as much record time as it has, it would be nice to have a mini USB port to be able to drop saved recorded loops into the computer without having to output the pedal to my UA Apollo and track the saved loops in real-time.

All that said, gotta love Amazon Prime. Easy inexpensive return, and label cost deducted from refund amount. Even through a 3rd party seller(Moore Brothers Music)!",1

5894,"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play.",1

It seems that it is somehow very sensitive to the midi flow and I guess it gets choked up pretty easily.

The other major problem is that when I am running Colossus Piano and I turn up the volume on the app, there is MAJOR digital distortion.....when I bypassed the PlugKey's output and came directly out of the ipad, the signal was much cleaner, more powerful and the distortion was totally gone!

I generally don't write reviews on Amazon and especially kind of bad reviews...however, there is absolutely no information on this module on the internet and Korg support is horrendous.

The good part of the PlugKey is the charging ability and the MIDI input, when it's not choking on itself.  The audio outputs are a fantastic idea...but the sound quality actually sucks.

So there you go.  I hope Korg redesigns this thing.",1
5901,"This does what it says, though I find the functionality it takes away as a result to be unfavorable. I knew going in that I would have to block my tremolo, however, I hadn't caught on that using this would make my fine tuner for my 6th string pretty much non-functional. So, now if it goes out of tune just a little bit, breaking out the wrenches is in order.

It does what it is supposed to do, but you will sacrifice functionality from your bridge in more ways than one in order to get that ability. I also question the long-term durability costs, since it requires you to compress your bridge's fine-tuner tension plate far more and far more often than would usually be required during normal use.

A second guitar with an alternate tuning is definitely the way to go if you need the Floyd Rose functionality and need alternate tunings, but this is a good solution for a much lower price if you can deal with the required limitations.",1
5902,"The finish was not as nice as shown and the rosewood is almost black with no grain showing. In addition, there is a dull spot which mars the shiny exterior of the rest of the wood. The sound is OK, but not as good as other reviewers led me to believe.",1
5903,"OK, but not spectacular.",1
5904,"It's a novelty instrument that you leave at home, take to a jam, or perhaps record with.  It sounds dead if played alongside a real metal trumpet, it doesn't have the same ring to it.  The valve tubes go at perpendicular angles, and that means that you have more and more resistance, as you press down the valves.  It breaks up and sounds like you are really playing the heck out of it; think of Al Hirt.  Intonation is very good.  Plastic is not of the highest quality, I developed some cracks and the red plastic eventually just flaked off where the mouthpiece goes in; it doesnt affect the sound as the mouthpiece goes inside a metal tube covered by the plastic.  Seams are visilble on the tubes.  The valves work pretty well, except if you don't play it in a while, you may need WD-40 to get them unstuck.  The valves are otherwise easy to operate and oil, thanks to the holes on the valve covers on the bottom.

In short, any student metal trumpet will sound more like a trumpet than this.  This thing is very light and you can call it ""durable"" in the sense that plastic will not dent as easily.  It looks cool, it sounds like some kind of a trumpet, it tires you out, it requires more force to play.  Don't expect for this to replace your main trumpet.",1
5905,"They're pretty black, not bronze.  A little modification and they'll work great.",1
5906,"I tried this with my Canon T2i, 60D and HF100. It wasn't much better than what is built-in to these cameras at ""interview"" distances of up to 8 feet away. I even had a TV playing off to the side and it didn't really reduce the side noise too well. My tests revealed that my T2i and 60D have a ton of built-in hiss, so bad I would describe it as unprofessional. But, thanx to a firmware update from Magic Lantern, I was able to rid the cameras of most of the hiss.

Even with the hiss under control, I didn't notice any reason to keep this mic. It has low output even with the battery switched on (it has an on/off switch that didn't seem to make any difference - maybe it was off the whole time?). Also, the battery is one of those watch batteries and I prefer a simple AA or AAA. On the positive side, it looks well made and is sturdy and small. I suppose it may have improved the sound a little but not by much in my tests.",1

5910,"This pedal does great for something so inexpensive. It is a compressor/Sustainer that works - I give it 3 stars only because it is a little noisy for my taste but hey, for someone like me on a budget , it works and it a good solution until I can afford to spend real money on a high end pedal.",1
5911,"Of course this mixer can't compete with the better Pioneers, but it sure does have a lot of features which helps make up for its lack of ""solid DJ mixer qualities.""

First the good points of this mixer:

The effects are great. They sound pretty good and they have a lot of options. Two separate effects channels is super nice and something you don't even see on a lot of Pioneers.
Mixer has all the standard adjustments like individual adjustment per fader for the level curve.
Aaaand that's all I like about it

What I didn't like about the mixer:

It is impossible to use in the dark unless you know where everything is. It has a weird, nonstandard layout and the button lights are waaaay too bright so I can't see any text on the mixer because I'm being blinded by these LED lights that are as bright as stage lights that close to your face.
The absolute worst part about the layout are the kill frequency buttons next to the EQ knobs. When I'm twisting the knobs, sometimes my fingers hit those buttons and it just kills all the frequencies except for the low, mid, treb range of the button you touched. It's unacceptable how easy it is to hit it by accident.
And the headphone jack is a joke. On all my headphones, I had to max this out and it still wasn't loud enough. If you play in a bedroom, that's great but if you are playing out at clubs or raves then your monitor is going to be 10x louder than your headphone channel.

I used this mixer for months while I was a resident DJ at a small, underground club setting and only used it because it was another DJ's equipment. I bought a Pioneer DJM 700 later and it's so much better in every way that matters. There aren't nearly as many effects but I really don't care.",1
5912,"Though I haven't used these onstage yet, I doubt I will.  The problem is, these acrylic sticks have too much flex to rebound properly off drumheads.  In other words, their playing feel is poor.

Whether this is due to the button cell batteries moving around in the butts of the sticks, or simply a lack of rigidity in the acrylic construction, Firestix just don't have the solid feel of proper wood sticks.

I had intended to use these Firestix for my band's solo number, but I'm anticipating that their feel will compromise my playing enough that I would be better off relying on the sound and feel of my usual Vic Firth wood sticks than opting for the ""flash"" of Firestix.

The Amazon affiliate from whom I bought these also neglected to include the original Firestix package shown in the product photo, as well as instructions.  So as best I can determine, there is also no way to turn the Firestix off.  That means that any knocks the sticks take in my stick bag en route to a gig will cause them to flash, reducing battery life.

I will update this review if I revise my opinion after our upcoming band rehearsal, when I will try out the Firestix.

Until then, I will consider them best suited as a kids' toy rather than an instrument for a pro or semi-pro drummer.

Disappointing...",1
5913,"The unit is great, allows me to power on each piece of equipment individually.  It is not very deep so allows for room in the rack area.  The only issue I have is it doesn't fix correctly in a standard rack.  The rack mounts are wider than where you line up to mount so I was not able to screw it in all the way so to leave space for the edges to extend over the case edge.  Its minor but would have been nice it if was a standard width rack.",1
5914,"I have used this pedal on 3 different amps, with 2 different guitars.  The quality and usefulness solely depends on your set up and what you are looking for.  I realize that may sound obvious, but I was surprised  just how different the pedal reacted depending on my set up.  For reference:

Set up 1: Mesa Boogie Triple Rec head with matching boogie 4x12 cab with a Les Paul Std and SG.  Wasn't expecting much but did get some acoustic type sounds out of it.  Was pleasantly surprised.

Set up 2:  Fender Blues Jr with Epiphone Casino.  Sounded terrible.  Was really hoping for good things but after nearly 3 hours of fiddling with the pedal, nothing good (to me) came of this.

Set up 3: Bugera v55 head, with matching Bugera 2x12 cabinet.  This was my favorite.  Both the Les Paul and SG gave me good acoustic sounds that I would happily use on stage in place of lugging and acoustic with me.

At the end of the day, like any pedal, you gotta try it with your rig and your ears to decide what works for you.  Many pedals you have an idea of what you are going to get, but after nearly 20 years of playing locally and professionally, I was quite surprised how much the sound varies from amp to amp and even guitar to guitar with the same amp.",1
5915,decent product,1
5916,I love the weight and length of these sticks but prefer the glossy lacquer to Matt Finnish they come with..please go back to the original lacquer finish Vic Firth!,1
5917,"when given a budget for cheap microphones, the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one. I like the fact that it adds a deeper, bassier tone to any voice but it's missing clarity. If you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity, spend 30 dollars less and get an MXL 990 instead. it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case. I hooked the 990 up to a cheap ART Tube MP preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it, they agreed that the 990 was clearly superior to the V67G that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp. Some vocalists actually prefer the MXL 990 over a couple of my Shure condenser microphones.",1
5918,"These are good, however I needed ones that are about half the size for my lavalier mic.",1
5919,"I read a review about how this Snark tuner devoured batteries before I bought it. I thought, well the price is good, has gotten good reviews and how bad can the battery use be? The 1st battery seemed to last a while(a few weeks ... a month?). I bought 2 dozen Sony batteries after that one went. Now it seems to go thru a battery once a week. And I have limited myself as to how often I use it and am careful not to leave it on too long. Besides that it is OK - after tuning each string into the small blue range, my Martin sometimes still seems a bit off. Then I do it the old fashion way until it sounds good.

Correction to this review. I emailed the company about the Snark sucking up batteries. The company replied and said it must be a defective unit and to return it in the mail and they would send me a new one. One showed up in the mail a few weeks later before I sent the bad one back. I did not know it at the time, but it was my son who sent it to me(he had one and just decided to give me one) not the company. The new one works fine -- batteries last as you would expect. Have not had to put a new one in since I got the new unit. That was at least 5 or 6 months ago.",1
5920,"I bought this product based on the excellent reviews.  There were only 5 star reviews, and a 4star review that didn't give any reasoning for taking away a star.  I thought this stand must be amazing.  It may be relatively amazing in comparison with all the terrible stands out there, but it isn't as great as all the amazing reviews make it out to be.

I knew I was in for a dissappointment when I took it out of the box and could smell quite a strong odor.  Now it has been out of the box for 3 days, and still smells like epoxy or some sort of glue.  It can be smelled from almost a few feet away.  Also, the sides of the wood were not finished wood but thickly coated in some sort of paint.  It's not solid wood, but a ply wood with a veneer over a bunch of glued-together sheets, hence the strong glue smell.  In terms of weight I would estimate the wood part to be mostly glue.  For me, products releasing formaldehyde and polluting the air is a concern, so I would rather get a solid-wood back than a particle board or plywood back as is the case here.

Don't get me wrong, looks-wise, this stand is pretty good, but at times it can kind of remind you of those cheap, laminate furniture at your local bix-box store.  If air-quality is not a concern for you, I might recommend it.  The base works very well.  I realize I could keep it and just throw away the top and put a solid wood top on it, but I will probably return it and try another wood stand.  It wouldn't bother me quite so much but it is not a natural smell, like cedar or something nice, but more of an industrial chemical smell.  It lingers on your hands if you touch it, so I would wash-up before you eat.  Yes, I could have expected this based on how many times I have been burned on other ""made in China"" items that have strong odors, but they are not all bad, it varies from product to product.  At this price, I thought I'd give it a try, so at least I tried it.  It's just not as good as all the 5-star reviews would lead you to believe.  It is functional though, and the base is good, so 3 stars.",1
5921,"the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily .. just try and leave it on always..

5927,"Pros:  Featherweight, very easy to carry.  Good for light loads.

Cons:  Utterly flimsy when compared to the Odyssey LTP8PRO which I also own.  Although it is rated 100lb capacity, I think this is unrealistic and strongly suggest you not load more than 45lbs on it if you are cranking it all the way up.  If you leave it at the lowest position, I think 60lbs would be about the max safe load.

This is a good unit if you account for the over-optimistic load rating.  Don't buy it if you want to crank up hefty speakers.  The Odyssey LTP8PRO comes with a cup to adapt to standard speaker receptacle and is a better choice for heavy stuff.",1
5928,"Cello strings are so very over priced. This one sounds acceptable, certainly better than the cheap china no-name brand.",1
5929,"It's OK for the price.  From what I understand, a chorus pedal works by doubling the original sound then
putting it slightly out of time and tune.  This pedal tended to place the sound more than slightly out of tune,
enough that others complained that I sounded out of tune when I used the pedal.  So I decided to
upgrade to something better and ended up selling this pedal.",1
5930,"Overall, this is a good product that does what it's supposed to do, as long as there is no rotational moment about its longitudinal axis. In plain language, if the mini-boom is horizontal and your mic is top heavy as many are, then the mic will rotate and hang down instead of pointing up. This is a result of the fact that the boom extension clamp cannot be tightened enough to prevent the weight of the mic from rotating the extension within the main tube. If you're happy with a hang-down mic, then this may be the mini-boom for you.",1
5931,"Def a must for bassists who want the Billy Sheehan tone.
I got it as a gag, since the price wasn't too bad.

All in all a good pedal. BUT it most likely won't be on my main pedalboard. It'll stay on the shelf for when I'm in need of that Sheehan tone.",1
5932,"The USB interface only kind of works. It functions, but the static over USB is HORRIBLE. With nothing plugged into the board the hiss was just as noticable. It happened on both my Win7 Desktop and my Win10 Laptop. I specifically bought this for the USB interface, so that's just about my worst case scenario.

Luckily I had the adapters to just use it as a powered mixer. For use as a strictly powered mixer, it works great. The phantom power works fine for my AT2035, and using the inputs and outputs on the top of the board everything works like you'd expect.",1
5933,"I just got this amp in the mail today.  I was looking for a small light amp that I could practice with and also to use at acoustic gigs when I wanted to add a little volume while soloing.  I didn't want to cart my heavy tube amp to an acoustic gig because one of the luxuries of acoustic gigs is EZ load in.  I have a couple small solid state amps and they just sound like transistor radios.  I figured I'd try this because it's a hybrid with one tube so it should sound better than my solid state amps.  WRONG!  It sounds pretty much like the solid state amps I have.  My first thought was to return it, but I actually like the way it looks so I'll just keep it in my man cave for practicing.  If you're not expecting a huge sound form this then you might look into getting one.  If you want something that sounds better and louder I would spend an extra $20-$40 and get a used VOX ADVT30.",1

5935,"First off, If you like that low, beefy, bottom sound of a guitar in open G tuning, then this won't get you there. BUT, assuming that you don't have an extra guitar to keep in open tuning, this Kyser really helps open up some fretboard maneuvering by doing a good job of ""faking it"".

What it does is clamp an A chord onto your openfretboard. From there you can treat things like an ""open"" tuning ... sort of. Still, if you only have one guitar, it saves you the time and cost of having to replace strings that go dead from de-tuning and re-tuning. If you are used to having a dedicated open G tuned guitar around, and are used to using flat-barring across the 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc. frets to ""keep going"", then you won't have that option with this capo. (i.e. using for slide)

However, I totally give it a Solid Thumbs Up, just with some restrictions.",1

5937,"Firstly, this is a great product in doing what it is advertised to do in it's a function AB or ABY box. It SPLITS the original cable, and sends this split cable to two amplifiers (if using ABY function). This can also effectively be an A B box and just switch between two amplifiers effortlessly. I think the A B function is it's best purpose, so why isn't it rated higher?

For me, the ABY function just doesn't seem very useful, the original guitar signal is split, so think about how your amplifier would react to this highly deluded signal. The sound ends up being a thin and under-powered signal coming out of two different amplifiers. So my intention was to get both of my unique amp sounds, a blues jr and a deluxe reverb, growling at the same time, but without the guitar signal being strong enough to push the pre-amp and power amp stages of the amp you get a very weak and out-of-phase like sound from two amplifiers.

So three stars, the product as an A B box is absolutely great, but as an ABY box and for the intentions I had, it really just doesn't have that ability since it isn't a powered unit that can accurately reproduce the original guitar signal strength to two amplifiers at the same time.",1
5938,"It does what I want it to, and with it being passive I never expected it to boost sound or even keep it that well.  It dampens sound a lot.

Not a huge deal, but a little annoying because my cheap Fender bags with no padding don't have this problem. Other than that, the bag seems well made, though it doesn't have as much padding as I thought it would. Oh, and for some reason, they keep sending me annoying emails now, even though I never signed up for anything. I really dislike that.

5958,"My daughter has a $40 Rogue mandolin that I was thinking about putting a pickup on since where we usually play the guy running the PA almost never remembers to turn up the microphone on stringed instruments.  Then, at a pawn shop, I saw a Fender mandolin with what looked like a single coil pickup under the strings.  It showed signs of being played a lot, such as fret wear, belt-buckle scratches, pick-guard scratches, etc., but nothing that indicated abuse or would look bad from more than a foot away.  The ""top"" panel of the tailpiece was missing - something I didn't even realize until I got the thing home.  But, again, to me that's cosmetic, and hopefully I can buy a replacement for a few $$$.

Reasonable wear-and-tear aside, it had very nice action up and down the neck, and it sounded great without plugging it in.  (I haven't tried plugging it in yet, but how bad can it be, compared to not hearing the thing at all, which usually happens when we play ""out""?)

The ""high"" end of the bridge is all the way down, but the low end still has room to adjust, plus I know how to get the high end down if I need to.  Intonation was way better than average for a low-line instrument.  In fact, the more I played it, the more I was convinced that it was ""set up"" by someone who knew what he was doing - no low or midline mandolin plays anywere near this well ""out of the box.""

The instrument also had a plastic triangle on the headstock, which implied that, unlike the Rogue and other low-line mandolins, it must have a tension adjustment rod in the neck.  With that feature I felt confident that I could keep it playing well indefinitely.

So I bought it for a fair price, with the idea of just passing the Rogue on instead of trying to add a pickup.

Then I got on the Internet to learn what else I could about it.  WHOA!  There were lots of ""avoid at any cost"" warnings, even more than usual for a low-line instrument.  Apparently the current model of the 52E is being made in a different factory, to different specs, than mine.  People complain about NOT having a tension adjustment rod in the neck, which would have been be a deal-breaker for me.  Others have complained about inexcusably bad construction, flimsy tuners and other issues.  I thought, ""maybe I misread the model #, because none of these issues appy to my 'new' used toy.""  So I dug it out to make sure.  No, my mandolin is an FM 52-E.  And it is well worth the cost of a new one, not to mention the amount I paid at the pawn shop.  I am SO glad I didn't read the reviews before I made my decision.

Now, for any low-line instrument, a certain percentage of complaints come from people who expect $200 instruments to sound and play like $600 istruments right off the boat. I always expect to restring, adjust bridges, tighten tension rods, file nuts, etc., on any instrument I get, so instruments that other people consider ""unplayable"" often work out fine for me and my students.  But the fact that the current version seems to lack a neck tension adjustment rod, means that one important adjustment every instrument needs sooner or later will never be possible.  Ooops.

So, how to rate this instrument?  The one I have is well worth the money.  The ones coming off the boat today are probably not.  I wish Fender had changed model numbers when they took the neck tension adjustment rod out of the spec.  So all I can really say is: If you find one WITH the rod, take a chance.  But it doesn't look you'll be buying one of those new any time soon.

Best of luck, hope this helps.

5959,"I've had this shoulder rest for a few months now. I like that it is adjustable and can be lightly twisted if needed. What I didn't like is the rivits that held the lower pad on. They eventually popped. Would have been nice to have the thumb screws on it like the upper pad. Also, it would have been nice to have images showing the many ways this thing could be adjusted. Note: if you need more height, pull off the feet and turn the bracket over- some bending may be needed. After the rivits popped I pealed the pad off the metal support and glued it directly to the main piece. I gave 3 stars because of the rivits.

5966,"I needed to buy a couple of these and I got this model because I figured it would be space saving. Nope. If that's your reasoning, I'd go with a traditional style that has the neck rest as well. The problem with these is on an electric guitar (slimmer body), it has to lean so far back to rest against the top of the stand that the neck of your instruments ends up sticking a few feet out the back of the stand. That's not very space saving, it's taking up more space than a traditional stand. This does, however, work very well for an acoustic. The thicker body takes up more space in the cradles and it stays upright, like how you'd expect. The cradles are bendy enough that you can bend them a little bit to fit your need, but I still wouldn't use them for an electric instrument.",1

It cuts the volume by quite a bit, but still allows the violin to ""ring"" just a little so that when you practice the nuance of the sound is reflective of what it would be if you were playing without the mute.  This isn't a dead quiet mute.  I'd say it at least cuts the sound in half, maybe a bit more.

The 3 star rating is because the fit is a little awkward.  I don't remember the one I had long ago having to ""stretch"" or maneuver to get it to seat just right like this one.  It's not that you can't get it to seat well, it just always takes a little maneuvering and the sides have to stretch outward to fit on my bridge.  Other than that, though, it works as expected, and for the price, maybe 3 stars is a little harsh and I should give it 4.",1

I previously bought the one for a short scale bass too, and I knew this one would be a suitable case for my purposes. I put a Fender P-bass in this case and it fit well. I gave it a three as yes, it is an OK gig bag. As far as your money's worth it would be a 5. You would have to spend a lot more to get  a better one - the price is in the sweet spot.",1

5988,"I bought the bundled amplitude package and it seems to have overlap repetitive amps in them instead of a totally different set in each pack.

Each pack has icons that are not available unless I pay even more money. I would expect a complete suite of amps, cabs and Fx for the money.

The irig2 unit itself may function as advertised electronically, however it is physically very poorly constructed in a cheap, nasty plastic case that gives me little confidence that it will last long enough to allow me to get value from the very expensive software.

Now, it would be okay on the software front if there were no Apple Garage Band to compete with, but I'm not confident the constant hard sell policy to get users to pay extra cash for add ons is going to endure. For me it just fosters resentment. Sure it's cheaper than the real hardware but it's not the real hardware, it's an electronic copy in a world of highly competitive electronic software simulation.

I'm using amplitude now in leiu of Apple no longer supporting my Ipad 2 with IOS 10 and hence won't download Garage Band but I'm not going to spend more on Amplitude upgrades than an ipad upgrade would cost.

Note: I've since purchased the entire 'AmpKit'  plus package. The irig 2 sounds superb through this app and the value for money with AmpKit is excellent.",1

It sucks that the tone feature is only usable in 440hz tuning. Also the manual recommends placing it to the front of your effects chain, but If you've got pedals which don't play well with others like my Blackout Effectors Fuzz Bear, you should put it after those, as it tends to overdrive your output signal. With this having the functionality of a stompbox you'd want to mount it within your first line of pedals on your board for ease of switching, but the amount of cables running at the back takes up needed space if your pedal board is small . But for vocal basics it's a good starting point.",1

5995,I love the tone of pure nickel strings.  I've been regular user of DR Pure Blues 10's and tried these just because I like to try new strings every so often.

It's OK as a practice amp, but I certainly wouldn't want to perform with it. In short, it's only a small step above toy level, which is what you'd expect for a twenty-dollar amp. That doesn't mean it's not useful, but you need to be realistic about what you're getting here.",1

6005,"On one hand, it's not quite what you expect it to be. On the other hand, we're expecting a lot. When it says it has great bass and it's ""pro audio"", it's not. This seems like some Chinese company slapped the name Mackie on it. The bass is not bass. And the housing feels like an egg shell. BUT we have to understand that it's battery powered. They all claim to be able to cut it but the truth is, under $2k you can't get bass from a battery. Or you can, but it won't be very loud. I suspect that if you plug it into the wall, it might have better performance, but mine was defective and didn't work without the battery. Willing to try it again if they send me another one. I can't say how long the battery would last at full volume. I retuned it after trying it for 10 minutes.

If you're playing acoustic guitar and vocals for a wedding ceremony or small coffee house, yes. Worth the money. If you're intending to lead disco dance parties for more than 10 people, no. So basically, I give this a great review when comparing it to anything in it's price range that is battery powered.

I'm experienced, but nowhere near an expert. Prior to this Akai controller I owned (and still own) two larger M-Audio controllers.

I bought this controller for one reason only I wanted one that was small enough to fit in my backpack so I could take it anywhere. With my MacBook Air 11"", this USB keyboard controller and a pair of earbuds, I have a portable studio I can literally take anywhere. To that end, this keyboard is great.

The one downside, and the only reason I am giving it 3 stars instead of 5, is the velocity sensitivity. I'm not sure if I just got a ""lemon"" but at least in my case, the velocity sensitivity on this is practically non-existent. If you use an extremely light touch, it will register around 30-40. Anything harder and it almost immediately maxes out at 127. I tend to be a ""hard hitter"" on the keys, and I really wish I could get more sensitive dynamics in the 80-120 range, but with this keyboard it's impossible.

I use the keyboard with Logic Pro, primarily to record keyboard/synth sounds (especially electric piano) and drum parts. Electric piano software instruments tend to have a ""hammer"" tone at 127, and drums sound robotic if there's no dynamic variance. This keyboard disappoints considerably for these uses, and I find I have to use Logic Pro's Velocity MIDI FX to tone down the dynamics. The results are usable but nowhere near as good as they could be.

All of that said, this is a $100 keyboard. Don't expect pro quality. The portability is excellent and I still primarily use this controller for recording  even at home instead of my larger and better M-Audio controllers. But be prepared to work around its weaknesses.

UPDATE: I read the comment here from the manufacturer and downloaded the editor software, but it does not appear that the velocity curve is an option in the software for the MPK mini. So I'm sticking with my 3-star review. (I'd give it 3 1/2 if I could. I do actually like this keyboard a lot, but the velocity issue and the weak software are a negative.)",1

Either this is a software issue on the most recent firmware, or the pitch bender whammy is defective.  Wonder if anyone is having this same issue.

Also, there is an index of tones it contains, but the number does not correlate to the same patch........ something wrong.

Update as of 12/5/2013 - I thought it was strange there was no option to revert the Firmware back in time.  Even the Factory reset
does not change this which is odd.  I sent back the faulty guitar and waiting on a replacement.

It appears there was some type of software issue and guitar was sending or receiving midi data to self adjust it's pitch. Incredibly annoying.

Update as of 12/13/2013 :  Replacement arrived.  Seems to be working fine.  No pitch shift on it's own.  I am NOT updating the firmware.  Word of warning.  If it is working fine, do not upgrade the firmware unless you fully read what has been fixed.  Latest firmware at the time of writing is flawed and should not be installed.",1
6068,"Some might like the design but I didn't.  I can't comment about the durability because I replaced them in a few months. The low E, A, D, and G string sound tinny and artificial. The coating on these strings makes slides easier, but the downside is there is very little friction and the string feel slippery under your fingers, may not be a problem for some people. I find this especially problematic for pull offs.",1
6069,Works as advertised. Im still bummed it didn't come with the amp as it adds another clunky pedal to have to carry around and cable.,1
6070,"It's not the best but not the worst either, I'd say mid grade for my purposes. I play my tenor sax at least two hours a day, so there's a lot of moisture to get out and at the first swipe it's soaked. However it is fairly absorbant and in conjunction with a pad saver will def preserve a less used instrument.",1
6071,"I got this pretty fast. I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.
If I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are great right out of the box usually.",1

6081,"A great pedal and does many great things. I'm not going to do a review but hand out this advice - I have this on my pedalboard for use with both my acoustic and electric rig. I usually have it set on something very simple like a delay or a reverb. But at a gig the other night I had it set up with the MFilter and some overdrive but didn't have the chain engaged. Playing my acoustic through my Fishman amp I couldn't understand where the drive was coming from. Ripped my board apart - rewired everything - changed that setting the drive was gone and my acoustic sounded great again.

I don't remember if I read that it wasn't true bypass or not as I've had the pedal for some time. Now I know!

Beware of no True Bypass!

But other than that nightmare I had - it's got some great sounds for not a lot of money!",1

Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit, though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment, Line 6 equipment, Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar, amp, wah, and guitar, or amp, wah, guitar, and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out, though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player, but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling.",1
6087,"This is purely my opinion, you have to remember that guitar strings are almost 100% a matter of personal preference, but Amazon asked me for feedback so here it is: I won't be buying these again. I was intrigued by the marketing for the ""nickel bronze"" concept, but to me they just sound tinny. I'm going back to phosphor bronze. I have no problems with the quality of manufacture, packaging or transaction, I just don't like the way they sound.",1

If you only have three or four microphones, then I think that you will find this to be very useful.  But now that I have about 50 mics, I find that I seldom use these.  Overall, if you choose the right capsule/switch settings for your job you should be very satisfied with the sound.  However, the build quality is a bit weak.",1

Plan on getting a professional setup unless you get a perfect one out of the box. I had two of these one of them had high frets and terrible fret buzz which pretty much couldn't be corrected without being plek'd or filed and the second one had a twisted headstock.  In the end and the cost of having a plek jobI just went with a Gibson Les Paul Studio which is hands down one of the best playing guitars I have ever owned.

Overall this is a great guitar to jam/learn on if your not OCD about fret buzz, finish is about equal if not better then what you get with guitars 3x's this price. However for me personally it just didn't work out I went with the a Gibson Les Paul Studio.  Play one in the store before buying just my advise.",1

In using ""dead cat"" style windscreens like these, it's better to remove the typical foam windscreen in lieu of the dead cat - you want wind protection, but don't want to lose high end response and intelligibility. This Neewer furry windscreen inside diameter is to too big inside to NOT keep the foam windscreen that comes with the Talstar mic. Will see how this affects the performance of the mic itself.

On the other hand this is a $10 windscreen for at $28 mic so some allowances might need to be made...",1

The leather holes and slits are a little small because the leather is so fresh and stiff. It's a little tricky to get it around the button. Not impossible, mind you, works fine, but I'm a little paranoid about having to force it and damaging the wood of my ukulele. I ended up extending the slit just a little, which fixed things.

I like the flexible rubber boot and the XLR connector seem very well made and sturdy.  I bought five of these cable they are hooked up to two Audix large diaphragm condensor mics, one Granelli/Sure SM57 snare mic, one Audix D-6 mic, and one Solomon LoFreq Mic.  The cables don't introduce noise to the signal.  These are probably ok for recording in a studio, but I'm not sure if I would take these out to play live gigs as the durability of them seems suspect to me at this point. It seems like the rubber jacket surrounding the mic line itself should be thicker.",1

I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock, a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both, if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb.",1
6102,"I ordered a 1300 as an upgrade from a 1100 because of the included timer remote and the additional fog output.  I sold my 1100 before the 1300 arrived.  That turned out to be a mistake because the 1100 was a better product.  The 1300 timer remote that I received does not work and the fogger is obnoxiously loud. Each time it begins a fog burst it makes a loud hissing/sputtering sound that causes the neighborhood dogs to bark. After the burst starts it becomes somewhat quieter. I don't want a fogger that attracts attention to anything other than the fog. The fogger does output a lot of fog.  Hopefully, I can get a warranty replacement timer remote but I doubt it will arrive before Halloween. I'll update this later if it is possible.

Update:  Oct 2010. Chauvet quickly shipped a replacement timer remote and it arrived before Halloween, however the replacement didn't work either. I used the fogger outside using a homemade cooler chiller and 12 foot plastic slotted drainage pipe with very good results. I used about 1 1/2 gallons of Chauvet fog juice in four hours. I cleaned out the fogger following the instructions (distilled water and vinegar) and put it away for the year.

Update: Oct 2011.  I test fired the unit and it made fog for a few bursts but nothing afterwards.  Flushing out the pump resulted in another burst and then nothing. I repeated this several times with the same results. After 2 calls Chauvet tech support finally shipped a replacement pump under warranty (it costs $30 normally) and it fixed the problem. The fogger is very simple and easy to work on. The guy that I sold my original 1100 to stored his last year without cleaning it out and left fog juice in it.  His still worked fine this year.  Guess I'll try leaving in the fog juice when I store it this time.

Some Halloween sites report that the fogger heater actually uses about 800 watts, not the claimed 1300 watts.  The claimed 20,000 cfm output is only useful when comparing the unit to other Chauvet foggers. This fogger has some issues; the only controls on the timer remote that work are the manual and continuous buttons, noise, and reliability, but it seems to have the best output for the price.

Update Sept. 12, 2016: I still have my Chauvet 1300 and this will be its 7th season.  It broke last year - thermostat went out.  It was an easy fix though, the part cost $20 including shipping and was easy to install.

Update Oct. 23, 2017. My Chauvet 1300 is still working fine and this will be its 8th Halloween.  Awesome product.",1
6103,"Well, you see I don't have much experience with mics. I honestly bought this because I saw Christina Grimmie use it. However, since using it, I realize that one of the reasons why it worked so well for her is because she used it with a midi-keyboard, while I wanted to use it with my acoustic guitar. Therefore, the sound differ. It is a good mic, don't get me wrong, just you'll need to learn a program to help make you sound a bit better and such.",1
6104,"Seems like I'm a minority but this is not for me. I like how these feel when they work, and they do when new, but when they fail it can get ugly.
In my band I have to play acoustic guitar to compete in volume with banjo (which I cannot but I try anyway), so I tend to play hard. I typically use medium gauge strings.
The problem is that sometimes they chip when strummed hard, and the edge becomes jagged. I'm not talking about normal wear, i.e. strings abrading/scraping pick materials away slowly and gradualy. In the case of ultex, even though the normal wear is much slower than delrin and celluloid, suddenly some tiny chunk of material flies away and that's it. Once this happens the edge catches the strings and I cannot play solo any more, so I need to swap the pick in the next song to continue playing. I keep the pick anyway and sand the jagged edge later.
To give this thing some credit, I've never had a chipping problem when I play electrics with 10-42 set. I can imagine that this is a perfect pick for some players.",1

I have both a Mandolin and a Violin, and am lucky that this one device fits both instruments.  On the mandolin, the pick-up sounds amazing for recording purposes.  I stick it in a gap under the bridge.

As for the Violin, wedging it into the bridge feels like it mutes the sound somewhat.  Sadly, it also makes the low notes sound extremely flat, almost ""buzzy"" and ""nazaly"" at the same time.  I have to stick to micing the violin when it comes to recordings.

The mounting of the 1/8"" adapter is pretty clunky.  I have a decent amount of velcro tape that I use to mount the adapter to the various instruments.  Be sure to secure the small amount of wire between the adapter and the pick-up to reduce any movement noises introduced from the supplied cord.  I also sometimes get what feels like a grounding buzz that disappears as soon as I touch the metal part of the adapter.",1

I tried turning the cover around the other way, but that didn't help.  Perhaps it got flattened somehow in shipping, but I didn't see any damage to package so I doubt it.

Since I'd already drilled holes in my vintage bass to match the holes in this cover I was pretty freaked.  I figured I could bend it enough to give it more upward curve, but if I did, the mounting holes might be too close together.  Somehow I managed to bend the bass side of the cover enough to let the E string ring out without significantly changing the hole placement.  It looks fine and I have no more rattles, so I have to say is okay.",1

As far as playing this harp, it's okay. I can play simple tunes, like Edelweiss. It doesn't sound great but it's a fun way to pass time when I am waiting for something.

I'm giving it 4 stars however, because the Korg drivers do not work with Ableton Live 6 running with Windows XP 64. Once I uninstalled the Korg drivers and let XP reinstall, it worked without a hitch. I tried installing the Korg drivers several times and in different order. Nothing fixed the problem. Korg's own editing software didn't see the control surface either.
The only glitch I have so far is for some reason, the other 3 scenes don't completely save the parameters I assigned. I assigned the track 9 fader to be the master across all 4 scenes but each time I bank back and forth, it doesn't save fader 9 for some reason. Good thing in Live 6 it's not hard to re-map. I'll mostly be using scene 1 anyway I'm sure.
The sliders and buttons are nice and what a nice thought to put some actual useful transport controls right there! All in all it's awesome, especially with the lightning fast shipping from Unique Squared and for $40! And the shipping was free!

I have not broken any bow hairs before getting this bow.  I'm not banging the bow against anything, so I'm wondering why the hairs would keep breaking.  For my silent practices, this bow does seem to be adequate.  The bow feels light, the wood on it reminds me of the wood on a #2 pencil.  Cheap, but not too awkwardly unbalanced.  The description says the hairs are real horse hair, but I'm not convinced that is true.  They feel more plastic or nylon like, with the consistently of the stringy part of corn on the cobb husks.

This bow is serving its purpose for now, but I am glad to have additional bows to use when I'm less concerned about the noise.  I'm not sure how long this bow will last...  When it does fall apart, I probably won't bother fixing it.  I also probably wouldn't buy this one again.",1

6139,"When purchasing a kit like this it's good to go in with both eyes open.  I've built several guitars.  It's fun... and that's what these are for.  However, several things should be considered:

  * These kits aren't a money-saver.  For the same price you can purchase a completely finished, assembled guitar of equal or better quality. You can often find a Fender Squier at this price, as well as other brands.  So this shouldn't be considered a way to get a ""cheap guitar"".  Buy a new or quality used guitar instead.  But if you want the fun of assembling a guitar, this works.
  * If you buy a kit, examine all parts before beginning assembly.  If there's a significant flaw in the body or neck, request a pre-paid return and replacement.  There is no reason to settle for a flawed or sub-standard kit.  They're sending out base parts at a new-guitar price.  The kit should be of good condition.
* Check your body and neck and parts thoroughly prior to beginning.
* Kits usually aren't ""ready to assemble"".  A considerable amount of work needs to be done on the body prior to even beginning assembly:  wood filling, rough sanding, sealing, final base sanding, base coat, painting, fine sanding, more painting (usually around 4-5 coats of paint might do it), more sanding,  several coats of clear finish (including extreme fine sanding), and then finish coat (ie guitar or auto wax or finish).  The entire process of preparing the body can literally take two or three weeks if done correctly.  If rushed and done incorrectly, you'll wind up with a guitar that looks rough and home-made.  You won't be happy with the end results if you cut corners.
  * Be sure to research painting and finishing guitars.  It will save you lots of headache and disappointment.
  * Take your time.  Don't rush.  Building it is half the fun.  Be prepared to let the guitar sit for a week to let the paint coat dry properly before beginning the clear coat. Take a couple hours (or more) in basic rough sanding.  Sand by hand rather than tools; it's far more satisfying and keeps you in full control (electric sanders can take away too much material very quickly).  Use different grades of sandpaper, starting from rough to fine... then finish with 0000 steel wool.  People tend to rush sanding and painting.  Paint in thin coats, allowing drying time and following instructions so the paint doesn't bubble or corrupt prior coats.
* Don't spray paint outside if it can at all be helped.  You won't believe the amount of dust and tiny bugs floating around.  Erect a tent if you have to... but try to paint in a sealed, dust-free environment.
* Don't spray paint in your bathroom or other inside room, no matter how much newspaper you put down--  unless you want furniture and fixtures the color of your guitar (ask me how I know this).  Painting is best done in a workshop or garage, or inside a large-size box to control overspray and floatspray.
* These kits often contain wood patching and may require more patching before done; they're not made of high-quality wood.  A solid wood guitar blank can cost $100+ all by itself, so a kit like this is best painted.

Once you get the body ready, the rest is relatively a breeze.  If done correctly you'll be really proud of a job well done.  But the BODY is the main focus.  Anyone can put together guitar parts.  It's a real trick to create a flawless body.  (Actually, don't expect the results to be flawless; few of us have the professional conditions necessary to do a truly fine job.  But you can do pretty well.)

If you're trying to save money on a guitar... this isn't the answer.  But if you're looking for a fun project or a hobby, these are great.",1

6153,"This stand is NOT a 'heavy duty' one. It's designed to be VERY light and relies on knobby screws to arrest the telescoping mechanism of the stand. It collapses very well into a small zippered bag. It is NOT suitable for a laptop or even heavy music book. It is, however, ideal for packing up your kit and not lugging around extra weight. While the base is reasonably broad, the 'table' (w/springs to hold pages/sheets down) is too light to hold anything heavy which would make it top heavy anyway. If you're going to need a music stand in primarily one place (stage, home, school, etc.) then invest in a heavier more sturdily built model with a large weighted base and much heavier telescoping stand that this unit which has very small diameter tubing that won't take any amount of abuse and will bend easily. It's a bit like those pocket umbrellas--they're not very rugged or big but they're very convenient to carry around since they occupy so little space. This unit is a bit expensive for the limited amount of material/hardware composing it. Still, I'm glad I purchased it for its convenience and portability if not its durability. I do not believe this would be suitable for an outdoor venue where there's any possibility of gusts of wind, which would easily knock this over given how light it is. On the other hand, when we're traveling, most of us don't want to be packing around anchors in our kit. In my view, this should have been priced under 20 smackers instead of over 37.",1
6154,"The idea is great--a permanently placed tuner, inconspicuous and small. Buy one for each axe!

The tuner works well enough. I don't know the accuracy, because the PlanetWaves people have not deigned to reveal the specs either on their website or in the instructions. But they seem on the note.

The buttons to turn it on and calibrate are a touch dicey, though. It is easy to turn it on inadvertently.

Here's the caveat: It won't fit well on every guitar. I bought it specifically for my Taylor 414 (built 2000). All the photos of the tuner on acoustic guitar in promotional materials show the tuner near the tuner key for the high E string, between the tuner post and the nut. That would be great. But it's not going to work on a guitar that has too much of a curve there--the headstock angling away from the fingerboard, or one with too broad a truss rod cover. There simply isn't room on my 414 for the tuner to sit between nut and E tuner, and be tightened down. The only place it really fits securely on my 414 is right at the very top of the headstock, in the little divot above the Taylor logo. So much for inconspicuous, but that would be okay. However, that position means that the view of the tuner screen itself is then obstructed by the left hand on the tuner keys. So you have to look around your hand to see the screen. This is not really the way it's supposed to work out.

I put it on my Line 6 Variax (original model, with 3x3 headstock). It works on it, but there is only one single place it will fit (and that's on the bass side of the headstock, not the treble side as is shown in all the Planetwaves promo). It fits, but only just. I haven't tried it on my Strat yet.

Update: I have revised this review and taken it from 4 stars to 3 stars. The reason: This tuner is not secure on two of my guitars--the ones I wanted to use it on, as they are my everyday-use guitars. The problem is, they seem to have designed this as a response to the unworkability of their other headstock tuner on Fender Telecaster guitars. Watch the PlanetWaves video, and their brag is: It fits great on a Tele headstock. It fits on my Strat headstock. The reason is that Fender does a fairly quick incline from the nut to the headstock, and the headstock itself is not angle but lays flat, and with the 6 tuning keys on one side, there's a nice open expanse on the headstock to which the tuner can attach.

That is not the case on either of my other guitars, so while it will stay on my Line 6 Variax, it is not secure--there's not enough flat real estate on the headstock for the whole tuner to sit. The result is that, when pressing the power button or the calibration button, the tuner moves around and can easily be pushed off the guitar, because it can't really sit securely. The pressure needed to use the power button is sufficient to slide the tuner off if its grippy rubber pads are not and cannot be seated flat.

This will be different for every guitar, so don't think that this tuner actually fits well on every guitar--and it may not fit on yours. If you buy it in a store, try it on a guitar like yours if you can, to see if it fits anywhere. Otherwise, buying it blind, you're taking a chance.

It's a good tuner. On some guitars, at least, though, it will fit only one place on the headstock, and sometimes that place is just unusable. On other guitars, it will not really fit at all. And on some--I wonder if it's only a few--it fits just fine. If you want it for a Strat or Tele, it will work great.

Update, 4/21/12:
I kept the tuner on my Stratocaster. Then I got a 12-string acoustic, on which, of course, this did not fit. But I still wanted to use a small, permanently mounted tuner on the new guitar. So I just dismounted the tuner from the attaching clip (it comes off easily enough, designed to do so), and put a square of Velcro on the tuner top and on the guitar. (I had to cut a notch in the piece on the tuner.) So now I have it mounted on the back of the headstock of my 12er, at a 45 degree angle. I wish the Velcro were not quite so puffy, but it works fine. One could also use adhesive putty or some glue dots.

Since that worked so well, I'll probably buy another for permanent residence on my Strat, and maybe even tuners for the rest of my ukes and guitars.

In fact, Planet Waves should really accommodate those whose guitars this won't fit (most, in my view) by enclosing a secondary form of attachment. The old Sabine AX-3000 had a type of tacky pad on it that holds well to the guitar and can't be lifted off, but when twisted slightly comes off without marring. A sticker of that kind of material included with this tuner would solve attachment problems for those whose guitars don't have space for the default clip on this tuner.",1

6164,"Honest Dan here.

The midi keyboard is good for someone looking to practice or make simple recordings. If you are more advanced I would recommend the 49 key because it is difficult to fit both hands on it without hurting your wrist. I didn't like the Red Analog stick at the top because it is hard for me to use whenever I need to. The drum pad is great. I do wish that this keyboard had a number screen telling me what octave I was on but it does have a light switch blinking that signals which octave you are on, however if you are focusing on recording, you can easily forget. The mixer knobs are decent but I rarely use them because I use the DAW mixers for that. I personally recommend the 49 key even if you are a beginner because you need to get used to playing with both hands instead of one hand at a time, which is often what I found myself doing.

There are two large issues with this unit:

First the Preamps for the inputs are not quiet.  Any extra gain no matter which input you use, will give unwanted white noise.  My Electrical is grounded and I am using extra grade cables.  This is unacceptable.

Secondly, line level instruments such as a drum machine  (Also an Alesis) and an external digital Piano, needed so much extra gain, that the white noise appeared again.  Again, too much white noise in the background for my taste.

If you want to record with as little noise as possible, I recommend a dedicated audio only USB 2.0 interface.
I tested this unit against my older Presonus Audiobox and the Presonus by far had the quietest preamp circuitry
without question.

I do still use my Alesis Firewire 16 and this unit was somewhat better grounded with better circuitry so I am at a loss as to why there were so many issues with the 8 series.",1

take up the uke has been a Godsend to me!...why?....it simply occupies my fragile brain!...at 80, ya gotta keep busy son!!...

And, yes, I did check out wether I could get enough amplification by just playing into the mic with no
additiional amplification, and many of the experts I talked to said, yes, I could do that and it would
work out fine.

The Zyex may work great on a quiet violin that has trouble being heard.",1
6207,it's decent for the price. It is my first T-bar truss so I don't have anything to compare it to. Overall the quality is OK. Some screws seem to get loose after a while so you probably gonna have to double check them before a gig. Don't put heavy lights because it's not too sturdy. Seems to wobble. If you have some micro lasers or led slim par cans this T-bar should be good.,1
6208,Not what I expected.  The base is too light for what I needed.,1
6209,"I would have loved to love these lights, and kinda do. They just have too many drawbacks. First and foremost, one of them doesn't reset right at all. The first time I took that one out of the box it seemed kind of messed up. Like it had been the weakest link, in a link full of weak links. The good one, as we'll call it, resets like it should. Turns in a 180 degree turn, then drops. This other one seems to do that, about 165 degrees then drops and grinds the gears. They just don't match up in a master/slave setup. This one also seems to make more noise in the grinding of gears when in fast mode than the other one too. Making it seem like that one will be dying before the warranty is up. Sad to be said. As these lights are a pretty cool addition to my already great setup. I was thinking about another two of these to go with them. Although with this fallback, I don't know if I'm willing to invest in another $200+ to get the setup I was hoping for.
That being said, colors are bright and look great with fog. Lights are quite responsive to sound when on sound active mode. Fans get a little loud, but what is music for? They can get as loud as they want and when on sound active mode they behave like a champ. Just wish I had a matching, working, in sync pair. They are off by so much it made me laugh so hard I almost fell off of the couch. I realize that they are supposed to be the cheap alternative, but to what extreme, I ask you? Everything that I have used in the past has synced up better than this. I use these mirrored, with a master/slave pan/tilt inversion, makes a great show with the right lights. Maybe these just aren't the right ones? Awwwww.......q&A.......",1
6210,"I bought this stand based on a review from an Amazon Customer who had a Blues Deville Reissue. Mine has the 4 10"" speakers in it.

I'm disappointed in this stand as the construction of it isn't sufficient for Amps like mine or an Amp that costs more than $300. I've owned all sizes of Fender Amps.

This Amp is too heavy & can easily be pushed backward by anyone who doesn't know better. This is why I put the 2 15lbs hex weights at the front bottom base. I'm keeping the stand but it's not reliable to play gigs with. It's a house stand.

The tubes that make up the AFrame are small & the tubes at the base of the stand are 1/2 as small as the frames tubes.

I'd not use it at a gig for any of my Fender Tube Amps such as my 1966 Princeton or any Amp you really care about.

I'll have to find something twice the price at a music store.",1
6211,These work but are obviously not the best quality.  They are probably better suited to a permanent installation as they seem too flimsy to hold up very long in mobile applications.,1
6212,"Needs better mic preamps.  The need to be quieter and have more gain for those that use dynamic microphones. Unfortunately most other mixers have the same level of preamp gain these tend to be nosier than most.
If you use dynamic microphones spend the money and get a better mixer.",1
6213,"The product arrived damaged.  I was a little worried when I saw a few black bits slide out along with the he horizontal part of the stand, turns out one of the screw caps (which makes it 10x easier to turn them with your fingers) was broken.  It wasn't much of a problem at first since maybe 2/3 of the screw cap was still attached, but it came right off after a few turns and it's not going back on any time soon.  The product was also a little scuffed up, the label was a little rough for wear, but the metal seems fine.

I really wish this product was studier, while it has a lot of different ways you can adjust it it's not great for any heavy duty equipment and I've resorted to weighing it down with bags of rice.  Overall I'm satisfied for now, but just satisfied and I know I'll definitely be getting something sturdier in the future.

I ended up returning this product, it just didn't work for me.  If you have a light microphone and no back shield I'd say go for it, but don't try putting anything heavy on this and don't expect anything with a small screw hole to work on it without a converter.",1

6215,"It works as expected and nothing to complain about. It's a tad more expensive than I feel it should be for such a small amp. The design looks better in the ads than in real life, in my opinion. There's not a huge range of tones it can play.",1
6216,"I love D'Addario strings, and I love performing on fresh strings! As a gigging, weekend, musician, I'm changing strings on 1 or 2 guitars a week.  However, when I purchased this, I wasn't aware that the strings were not completely sealed. They are packaged in such a way that all strings of one gauge are together... you just grab the ball end and pull a string out of the roll/bunch.  They are not sealed individual sets!
I'm not sure if I can use these fast enough before any tarnish might start to set in. So unless you're changing a lot of strings, in a reasonably short time frame, I might suggest paying a bit more for the 10 pack of individually sealed sets.",1
6217,"I read all of the reviews and bought 6 pairs of these based on the reviews.
So, I put these on my Gibson Les Paul last night and played for a few hours.  I didn't hammer the strings, just played easy, mostly the Eagles.
As I was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward, I took a quick look at the strings.  I was shocked to see the high E and B strings were already flattened.  I never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing.
The strings sounded great, but by the time I had them stretched enough that they would hold tune, they were already worn.
I guess I'm going to HAVE to go to heavier strings so I'm not changing strings every few days.  These just did not perform as expected.
Giving these 3 stars is being generous.  I have 5 sets to use up now, damn.  I was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up, but they lasted for only two hours......my Fender 3250L bullets at least lasted a few weeks.  Going to try the Fender on my Gibson and see how they sound.  I'm still in search of the ""perfect"" set of strings.  I'm open to suggestions",1
6218,"Not great sounding. adds to much compression with a bad setting on attack and release. this results in very ""punchy"" and aggressive lower end. VERY disappointed in this pedal. first and last TC purchase.",1
6219,"I appreciate the other buyers who went out of there way to write reviews for these. With that said, no, they are not that good of quality, and there tone is absolutely horrible. But I would still recommend them based on what your looking for.

Your looking at 6 dollar strings, what could you possibly expect? Chances are your either a broke musician, such as myself, or working on a project 12 string and trying to minimalize cost when going into it. For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.

12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.

All in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group. Just keep in mind that these are cheap strings, and you will not regret the purchase. Happy Playing.",1
6220,A bit chincy.,1
6221,"Ok. These things are dirt cheap, have short cords, aren't all that sturdy, and have a distinct hiss. But they're dirt. Cheap. In all honesty, they don't sound that bad. They're no Sennheissers, but with a little EQ and noise/hiss reduction, they actually work quite well in interview situations or for quick-n-dirty voice overs or ADR work. They sound WAY better than an in-camera DSLR mic, that's for sure. I've used these for quite a while now, and they do what I need them to. In fact, they sound very similar to some of the older lavs we use at the TV studio I work at. If you're looking for a way to get audio off camera but have no cash (or just want to save that cash for a better audio system but need something in the meantime), these are worth it.",1

Unfortunately, they don't stay on the sticks very well - they both came flying off near the end of the first song.

I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars, as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)

If you need a more percussive attack with your instrument and you don't mind the extra thickness, they might be perfect for your application.

Also, keep in mind that if you order these because they are ""jazz"" picks and you want something like the small red nylon Dunlops like Eric Johnson and others use, don't let the ""jazz"" reference influence you to buy these as these are not like the small red nylon picks in size and feel.

I fixed the problem by attaching a small rubber bumper under the support arm to raise it up so it now makes contact the entire way across the bottom of the amp. Other than that I like the stand and the built-in mic stand is a big plus, but you will need to buy a boom arm to make it work. I use the stand for a Roland Cube 80GX and it is stable now.",1
6239,"Nice instrument, good tone. I'm having problems learning technique . The instructions I've gotten have been pretty much worthless. I used to have a 6"" harmonica (this one is 4""). Mostly I think I need help from friends who play.",1
6240,"[After further use and consideration, I've had to revise my opinion downward.  The keys are slightly smaller than regulation size; the piano sound is uninspiring, especially from the onboard speakers, which chop off essential frequencies and begin to distort at medium volume; it's cheaply made (predictable); the manufacturers would have done better to charge a bit more and to include a power supply; the ""graded"" touch is a gross exaggeration (what touch?); the keyboard, though light enough, is a bit too long for use as a complement to a desktop computer; half of the sounds--pipe organ (no B3), harpsichord--are useless; it doesn't have handy, practical and essential ""pre-sets"" for layered sounds; in sum, it's not a keyboard I would ever use at a function where I was being paid in a position of being ""judged"" by my peers (e.g. a jam session).

What's perhaps most unique about the board is how well it performs with so little power--AA batteries!  And admittedly, it's handy to toss in the car and use as an instrument for rehearsing a vocalist.  But I'd never consider using it in a ""serious"" playing situation--especially without external amplification it has ""toy"" written all over it.  Recently, Kurzweil has come out with the SP4-76, which employs the best sounds of the acclaimed PC3 rather than those of the PC2 and is less than half the weight of the PC3.  If that's still too expensive, both Korg and Yamaha make pianos that are 8-10 times the quality for approximately double the price of the NP30 (be careful not to get fixated on the number 88--practically speaking, 76 is sufficient to get you through virtually any piano literature).  If you should stuck with playing this instrument in a context where it ""counts,"" just be certain to patch it to an external speaker-amp.  In fact, a Roland Cube Monitor will instantly turn this frog into a reasonably smooth-sounding prince (add a 2nd cube for a stereo clincher or a 2nd musician).

[Original review]:

If you'd like a piano just to be able to fool with the hundreds of sounds, onboard rhythms and tunes, look into a comparably priced YPG or DGX series of Yamaha pianos.  But if you're serious about playing, or learning how to play, do yourself a favor and step away from the automation, the ""karaoke machines with keys.""  Insist on an instrument that doesn't look like a souped-up, spaced-out toy and that will require you to actually play it.  If you can manage without anything close to authentic ""feel"" (I remember when electrics weren't even touch sensitive), and if you like the idea of carrying your instrument with no more hassle than a saxophonist or guitarist, the NP30 represents a breakthrough in terms of balancing cost, quality and convenience.

As a professional pianist, I normally require external amplification and keyboards that can be split to allow me to walk bass lines in the left hand (at the moment, I'm inclined to say the Kurweil SP4-76 is the least expensive professional instrument suitable for such purposes).  But there are occasions when I'm asked simply to provide solo or background piano for a luncheon, cocktail gathering, reception, etc.  In such instances, this keyboard fills the bill, and does so with style, convenience, and eminent practicality.  It's as light weight as they come, it has on-board speakers, and it doesn't look like one of those chrome-colored, overly automated ""toys"" sold at Best Buy.

No, the piano sounds don't blow me away (nor, for that matter, does the hyped ""Triple-Strike Kurzweil Piano""), the touch is far from being weighted and realistic, the speakers are not the most powerful or full-frequencied. (But they've proven adequate for background music in small rooms, though I'll admit I usually have a spare amp in the car, just in case.)  And for classical music, as opposed to pop tunes, I'd probably accept the extra load of 88, rather than 76, keys.  But those are the trade-offs for the conveniences mentioned above.

Ironically, a keyboard like this can ""force"" you into positive playing patterns.  For instance, I like to make extensive use during solos of widely-spaced block chords (piano great Red Garland made a living doing this), but on a keyboard this light it's not very effective to play blocked-chord solos of any sort.  Instead, I'm forced to concentrate more on my finger work and to play with unaccustomed restraint which, in my case, is not necessarily for the bad.

In short, this is probably as ""low"" as you can go and still retain a modicum of professionalism (not to mention personal pride) as a paid performer.  I should mention that I still have the lightest albeit discontinued piano stand ever made--an aluminum fold-out X-style device that uses a ""fabric"" belt and scarcely weighs as much as a pound.  Why no manufacturer has picked up on this design befuddles me.  Wish I'd purchased a couple more 25 years ago.",1
6241,Now this is not a real 100% made to play symphonic instrument. It's a neat toy for kids and kinda small otherwise. It makes ok sound but is still hard to play. You would get the same noise from a rubber band but it's metal an goes in your mouth. Note you may also chip your tooth if you are not careful. It's a kinda older kid toy or neat lifting thing to keep you busy an hour or so. It's cut my lips up pretty bad since it gives no real instructions besides a few which compared to online sounds like what not to do. For it's price it's pretty ok. Only if it was a bit bigger and had better sound. But it's about 8 dollars so I am not complaining about it.,1

6261,"First off, this little box will DEFINITELY make your K&K pickup sound better.  No question.  I wouldn't plug in without it.  That said, it bugs me to no end that the power is activated on it by plugging in the quarter-inch cable to the ""out"" jack.  I can only imagine that the thinking behind this is that this box will be worn on a belt-clip or attached to the guitar so the ""in"" will always be connected to the guitar and you just have to plug in to the sound board.  Sounds great in a live setting.  But in the studio?  HUUUUGE pain!!  I want to be able to set my guitar down while I tinker with the sound files.  Maybe it will take a minute, maybe I'll get caught up in it for an hour or two and then come back to a dead 9-volt.  Or, do I need to unplug the ""out"" jack every time?  wait, which one is the out jack?  Oh wait, I have to turn down the input to that channel to avoid pop and hum.  If you have spent some time recording in a home studio, you know the absolute TORTURE of plugging and unplugging cables and trying to keep them straight.

That there is no dc plug option is unfortunate, and that there is no simple power switch is just unforgivable.  I mean, come on K&K, simplest fix EVER!

Finally, I find it super annoying that the controls go VOL-TRE-MID-BASS from left to right.  I guess I can flip it over, but it somehow feels wrong.  I've had a few experiences where I am on stage and somewhat inebriated by the rush of performing or other things (!) and was cranking the bass when I meant to be cranking the treble or vice-versa.  Lucky for me I had a good sound guy who saved the sound even though I kept messing it up.

With the Tascam, you pretty much follow the physical manual, with the illustrated step by step instructions, so you can record right away. With the Presonus, it'll take you some time, before you can even THINK of recording. First, you have to fill out registration, and then download the software from their website. (It takes over an hour, just for the download, and about 15 minutes to register and do preliminary downloads.) After that, you have no physical manual to check, when you're trying to learn to use the PRESONUS interface, or the STUDIO ONE  The instructions for using the STUDIO ONE software, are filled with technical jargon, some of which I didn't even understand. The manual did nothing to help me quickly learn even basic operations. (For example, how can I get the HEADPHONES to work on the PRESONUS? Why didn't they want to work on my computer either?) The STUDIO ONE selected my computer's mic as primary. Would that switch automatically if I plugged in a mic to the midi interface box? If not, what do I do to change that setting? How do that find that particular piece of information, in the digital manual? By the time I figure this stuff out, I'm out of inspiration to record.

With my TASCAM, I can plug in two microphones at once. This matters, since I compose on an acoustic piano. You need two channels, to get a good acoustic piano recording. (Especially if you are after a stereo image.) The PRESONUS has but one mic input. If you want to physically mic your piano, or wanted to mic your acoustic guitar, while you mic your voice, to lay down a demo, you cant.  You can input a 1/4 inch input on one channel, plus a mic input in a second channel, on the PRESONUS. Both systems have phantom power, for condenser mics. Both systems have effects you can dial in. With the TASCAM, I have individual control of the reverb, from other effects. (Plus I think I have about 200 effects choices, with my TASCAM.) Now, I cant say I understand all the ways you can control the STUDIO ONE software, but I didn't see too many effects options. Plus, you cant dial out various parameters, without no doubt accessing a lot of internal subsystems.
3. EASE OF MIXDOWN
I like to be able to turn knobs. I like physical sliders. You have more control. Especially in mixdown, since how can you manipulate the STUDIO ONE software, to change two variables (Lets say volume and pan) at the same time? How can you make subtle changes? Worse of all, you will have to really study the HELP pages, where the manual is located, and take notes, to remember the protocol. Could a physical manual, with some easy to understand directions have been THAT impossible to deliver?
4. LEARNING CURVE
I was able to cut my first demo on my TASCAM right away. I was at least an hour, just trying to see if I could move the recording input into track 3, with the STUDIO ONE software. You have to more or less guess, under what heading this information lays in the virtual manual.  That's a very basic operation. In fact, I'm sure after you learn how to do this, its easy. (However, remember we don't cut demos day in and day out. We sort of cut demos, once a year, or once every other year, unless you are running a studio. So you WILL forget these computer protocols, between recording sessions, that are separated by a year, or two.) The STUDIO ONE program, has Utoob videos, to help you learn the ropes. Unfortunately, I found the videos simply did NOT work. I kept getting an error message from Utoob. The commercials played without a hitch, so obviously the STUDIO ONE training videos don't work right. For a company that doesn't give you a physical manual, I would think that a training video on a DVD included with the PRESONUS midi interface, wouldn't have been that expensive to produce.
4. BOUNCING TRACKS and EDITING
Both systems are 8 track, but you can run out of tracks fast, if you are doing backup vocals, or you have elaborate percussion ideas. So normally you bounce 2, 3, or 4 tracks onto a one track, to free up tracks. This isn't easy to do with the PRESONUS, in fact, it takes a lot of study on the virtual manual, and note taking. I never had a problem doing this, since my TASCAM has a physical manual, that pretty much shows you step by step, what button to push. Plus, you have all the added benefits of mix down options when you bounce on the TASCAM, verses the PRESONUS.  I had no idea what the manual wanted me to do, when I wanted to edit, or loop. It should be easier with the PRESONUS, since you can indicate with your mouse exactly where your edit point is. Yet, going by sight, or sight and sound but without a counter, isn't as exact as you might want it to be. Plus, again, a lot of menus to access, various choices and options you scroll through, with the PRESONUS. ITs so much easier with a digital recorder machine.
5. FINAL ASSESSMENT
It was always in the back of my mind, if I made a mistake getting the TASCAM, instead of a program to run on the computer. I'm glad I chose a physical digital recorder. You have portability with the TASCAM, not so with the PRESONUS, unless you own an iPAD. (The satellite program, that lets you plug the PRESONUS Midi interface into a computer tablet, only works with iPAD. My Android device can't run the program.) This means, hauling my desktop computer DOWNSTAIRS, set it up in the living room, hooking the PRESONUS interface to it, then attempting to record the piano. Or, if I wanted to go to a buddy's house to get him to overdub a track, it would be even MORE work. Plus, if my buddy wanted to borrow my PRESONUS to use for the day, I couldn't lend it to him without lending him my computer. So if you don't have an iPAD, that alone might be a good enough reason not to buy the PRESONUS system.

I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed with this. You might have a lot of seeming options with the PRESONUS, that you might not have with a digital stand alone recorder. Many of those options, are not practical. The manual is not user friendly. There is no QUICK START UP menu, so you can just cut a simple demo, without spending a week to learn all the options, and what does what. I was touching boxes, and getting options to change the color behind the track readout. But why would THAT matter to me? I don't need to spend my energy, especially my creative energy, learning software, or using my process to incorporate all the computer programming, just to cut a demo. My energy, my creative energy, needs to be placed in the acts of composition, and recording. When I mix down, I don't want to spend a lot of time, accessing menu after drop down menu, then deciding on a value for the volume, only to repeat the process, when I change my mind. Forget about panning. (Remember, nothing much is really lettered. on the STUDIO ONE software. Its point, read, or guess.)  I got so frustrated, so quickly. It doesn't help you, that you cant see this system, before you buy it. You can see the interface box, but not the STUDIO ONE recording platform page. I would highly recommend, if you are at all considering this purchase, to go to the STUDIO ONE website, and check out what that program is all about.  Remember, it isn't the number of options on parameters you'll never change, that matters in your purchase of a digital studio. It matters on the BIG issues. How many mics can you record from at once? How easy is it to use out of the box?  How hard is it to mixdown? Do you own an iPAD? How much of your time, and creative energy, do you want to spend learning to work the STUDIO ONE software, verses how much of your time and energy do you want to devote to composing and recording? Finally, what kind of process works best for you? I started out recording demos on a 4 track cassette machine. I made hundreds of songs take shape that way, so my process was adapted to using a physical recording machine,  turning physical knobs, and so on. If you have already learned your process on computer digital recording programs, or have used STUDIO ONE in earlier versions, maybe you wouldn't have the problems I encountered. Unless PRESONUS sends out a user friendly manual, or they adapt the satellite recording program for Android, I'm going to have to stick to my TASCAM recorder for now. PRESONUS is too frustrating for me.  I'm sure it works fine, within its limitations for input or effects, if you know how to use it. Its the huge investment of time, and energy learning this system, that I found unappealing.",1
6278,ALL good but not my favorite strings. I use the SP4100's by Martin for many years and was told to try these.. A great string but for me the tone was duller and smoother then the Martins.

6295,"I actually got this microphone for free due to a rebate, so I thought I would pick it up. I have since used it to record a few sounds around the house and a concert or two (don't worry, I had permission!)

As someone who deals in pro audio equipment, I didn't really have any high expectations for this little mic. It has records in Mid-Side stereo (with an adjustable 120 or 180 degree mode). It uses one AA battery to run and comes with a windscreen.

The quality of the mic is OK. For sounds around the house, it was better than my laptop's built in mic, but no where near even $100 microphones I own. It sounded ""distant"" to me. For concerts, it was barely an upgrade from my portable recorders mics which are noisy. It could handle the SPL and had a nice stereo spread, but it was not too clear.

I have also used this mic connected to my laptop for Skype. Once again, it was better than my laptop's internal mic, but no better than a $15-20 headset mic.

Overall, if you need a small, stereo, battery powered mic for a portable recorder, this is a cheap option. However, many portable recorders have good internal mics so this many be no better. Its best feature is the adjustable stereo image it can create.",1
6296,"I bought this for late-night office giggles. I wanted something fun to lighten up the mood when I'm here programming until 9 or 10 into the evening. Unfortunately, my humble dream of turning my desk into my department's premier party destination will have to wait. For $40, I wasn't expecting professional grade lighting equipment of course, and I was pleased with the excellent build quality. It is all metal and about the size of an American football or a roll of paper towels. This is a solidly-constructed light for the price, with a thick (but short) computer-type power cord and low power consumption (only 8W of electricity because of LED lamps), but I found some of the features lacking.

There is no on/off switch, but my complaint is with sound synchronization. It just doesn't work very well. The sound sensitivity knob is pretty much useless. It will only trigger on loud sounds and vibrations, like big thumping bass and clapping. Even holding the LX-5 right up to my Mac, I couldn't get it to pulse to the music. It will trigger on bumps against the housing though. So, for now, I will have to use automatic mode, which randomly cycles through patterns of red, green, and blue dots. The LEDs are bright enough to see across about 15 feet, even with the lights on.

6300,"Most of the samples are simply too high-pitched to be useful.  Granted you can lower the pitch with the knobs but that is pretty much a requirement of every single sample,  The high pitch may also be a factor of the substandard recording fidelity.

The biggest, most annoying problem with the OKGO unit though is the TERRIBLE lettering... it makes MOST of the controls nearly impossible to read without a very bright light source.  Giant OKGO is bad enough, but then red lettering on black background or light graylettering on white background!!  No wonder the OKGO unit sells for less than the standard unit...even though it has slightly more memory (you can load both standard samples pack and OKGO sample pack on the OKGO unit, but the standard (non-obnoxiously labeled) unit cannot load the OKGO samples (supposedly due to a slightly smaller amount of memory).  Still the OKGO samples are not that great, I would recommend the standard version if you can dealwith the high pitched sound issue.

Lastly, since this requires a (free) ios app to load samples...and Apple constantly changes thier development libraries...dont expect to be able to load samples on this 5 years from now...I mean you might be able to, but then again, I doubt Korg will keep the app updated once the product is discontinued.

I acutally got a very good deal on this unit at a little more than 50% off MSRP, and I still could not find enough good reasons to keep it (though mine had some unrelated technical issues as well, but in the end, I went for a refund rather than an exchange because of its sound quality, unreadability, and limited app-dependent lifetime issues).

For me it is one star, but for some it is 5 stars, so I am giving it 3 to be fair.

Volcas (and most lower end Korg devices) are intentionally crippled....and normally I can live with those limitations (although they are frustrating), but this one just takes it WAY too far.",1

I bought this set of strings in July 2016 and I just had to buy a new set at the end of April. Only a was starting to show wear, but I decided to change the set. My son plays violin 6 days a week for 40 to 50 minutes all year round. When you put them on they settle easily and they need very little tuning the first two weeks.  I am very happy with them. Great for a learning violinist.

This would be good to take on a camping trip or something where you didn't want to take a quality instrument.

It more resembles a metal horn that the other two plastic horns brands, and as far as I know, it's the only one in concert pitch.  You Tube has experts playing these, screeching in the rafters and playing classic excerpts.  I like to see what experts can do with whatever they have in their hands.  Note, however, that in none of these vids do they play with other musicians.  Why?  Because it cannot be properly tuned, at least not the one I received and returned.  Playing through all three octaves with different mouthpieces, different tuners and various stages of warmup, some notes in the mid range were close to 440.  The lower ranges were flat, many notes up to 20 degrees off pitch flat (lower octave) or sharp (upper octave).  I had three pleasant email conversations with their rep in England about this.  He offered, and I tried various solutions on the theory of air leakage.  No solution worked.  My opinion is that plastic instruments are still in a stage of development.  I truly hope they can solve the intonation problem and produce an affordable, durable, lightweight C trumpet, and how about a piccolo trumpet and one in D/F as well, for players with talent but limited cash.  Tromba, if you make one that plays all of its in tune like the metal instruments, let me know.  I still have a need for one.",1

The moral of the story is that these will not take much abuse and you'll need to be careful with them.

The strings were not abused.  This was first trial of the high tension strings, and I liked the result.  Typically it's the A string which breaks most often, but since it was the D string it may be a defectively manufactured string.

You kind of have to experiment with the five control knobs until you get the sound that you want, which I can basically do with my Marshall amp, or any decent amp. It also kind of hisses at higher gain. As a inexpensive effects pedal with somewhat decent ""gain"", I would recommend. However, if you really want to mimic other amps and eras, I would recommend a decent modeling smp like peavey vypyr or line 6.

6332,"After shopping the portable, digital recorders,  decided to try this one on the advice of engineer friend. Set up and ops are easy. I recommend taking your time to familiarise yourself with the recorder and reding the manual before using it. Over all, it is a nice little recorder but there are some quirks. Built in mics work well but recording can clip easily, even with the auto level on. Plugging in a separate cardioid or condenser mic works well but levels are much lower for some reason. Not sure I'd use auto level though many field news people do. If you're careful, I think you'll get better results using manual level control but it can get tricky. The unit comes with the a.c. adapter which is nice to have in case you run your batteries down, which can happen fairly fast. We liked the xlr/phone plug input. The speaker is okay enough to check your recordings but using with headphones gives you a much clearer monitoring and playback of your recording. The audio was not as good as some units like it, particularly the Nagra but it costs a great deal more. We thought it was a little better than a toy, as some describe. Versatility opens the door for some cool field work and you can do some fun stuff with it. Bottom line: If it were more expensive, you will want something a little higher end, otherwise it's good for a lot of jobs and even at home or in the studio. This is not a high dollar studio recorder, nor does it cost like one. I'd recommend it for small stuff.",1

#1. Ungrounded plug with a metal housing. Are they nuts? The cord for these is fairly short. My long term plan is to get a total of 12 of these together, 4 on each stage side, 4 along the back. Run a cord to them with a 4 way splitter. There is no way to get the cord down to the floor if you are using these on stands.

And on my favorite model, I never could get it as good.  If the actual tube amp is an oil painting and the amp's model is a photo, the Floor's model is a centerfold with a big crease and a couple staple holes in the middle.

Don't get me wrong.  It's a great value.  One boutique pedal could cost as much.  And the balanced left & right outs are much better for direct recording than a mini phone jack. It's fine for most everything you want a Mustang to do. But it also sounds better through a different amp.  It doesn't really sound that great through another Mustang amp. You can dial up the cleanest Fender Twin and use it though a Mustang, but if you try to turn off the amp models on the Floor and use say the Metal 2000 on a Mustang it doesn't work right. They fight each other.

90% of the time it does what I want it to do. There's just a couple things it will not do as well as a Mustang amp. I like both the Mustang Amp & The Mustang Floor, but for different things. It would be good if they played nice together.  But for certain things you're better off with a Mustang amp and an EXP-1 pedal.",1
6338,"Pyle makes useful things for great prices, and I would say in this case the box is adequate but not fancy at all.  I took mine apart and sprayed the bottom case with a hammered texture finish, which makes it nicer and more durable in my opinion.  The flat black shows every little scratch.  As I recall the top and bottom didn't fit together perfectly, and I was able to tweak that too.  After all that, I haven't really tried it yet, but it's ppassive, so it should be fine.",1

6348,"I bought the trilogy of Spectrasonics software, Omnisphere, Trillian and Stylus RMX. That was nearly a $1200 investment. In comparison with other similar software, the price is obscene. I could have bought at least 3 entire DAWs which would have included multiple instruments and effects, many thousands of samples, as well as scores of other useful tools. You have to ask yourself where all the money you pay is going. The high cost of this software is completely unjustifiable. The value simply isn't there.

I found the user interface to be hopelessly unintuitive, complicated and tedious to work with if I tried to use anything other than basic presets. There are layers and layers of subpages and right click menus. I trudged through the tutorial videos. But when it came to actually using the software I always ended up having to search around through tabs trying to figure out how to do what I wanted to do which hampered my workflow in a big way.

Another serious annoyance I encountered was that the slightest change to my system, including frequent security updates, deactivated the software. So EVERY time I went to use the software I had to re-activate each of the licenses. This involves logging into to the Spectrasonics website, getting an activation code and plugging that code into the software. With 3 licenses it was 3 times the fun.

What all this meant for me was that after activating the software, and then spending time stumbling around trying to figure out how do one thing or another, my inspiration would be totally gone. This is one of many reasons why I found myself using other software titles. There are too many other plug-ins that are far easier to work with, that sound as good or better, that don't deactivate if you sneeze too hard and that cost a fraction of the price.

A serious mistake I made was buying this software without having tested it first. Spectrasonics doesn't provide trial versions of their software. I don't know of any other software company that doesn't provide at least a 14 day trial. That should have been a clue what kind of company I was getting involved with. It's a detail I won't overlook again. And now I'm giving you the advanced warning I wish I had before I made my purchase. NEVER buy software from a company that doesn't offer a demo. Especially when it's extortionately high priced like this stuff is.

It was also a mistake to wait until AFTER I made my purchase to read the fine print. Had I read it beforehand I would have come to realize just what a greedy, tight, controlling and paranoid corporate entity Spectrasonics is. It's ironic that even the name, Spectrasonics, is reminiscent of that sinister organization, SPECTRE, in the early James Bond films.

I would urge anyone looking at buying audio plug-ins to take the time to carefully look into the details BEFORE making your purchase. You'll quickly recognize the undesirable companies that should be avoided like this one. At the very least make sure the company you buy software from has a liberal usage policy. In this case I suffered the consequences of not taking the time to do that important bit of research.

If you read Spectresonic's terms you'll see you're only actually paying for partial permission to use their samples on a highly regulated and temporary basis. You don't own anything. And in a very short time the temporary use permit you paid top dollar for will expire. So you'll have to continue paying more temporary usage fees or write it off as a loss. Is it any wonder so many people are using cracked software these days?

You'll also get an idea how restrictive and questionable a matter it is if you want to use their samples in published music. Having all those limitations placed on my freedom of musical expression is the last thing I need getting in the way of my creativity. I'm a musician, not an attorney. And it was for that reason I stopped using the software altogether.

I recently sold off some music gear and donated a bunch of other stuff I wasn't using. The Spectresonics trilogy was among the items I donated. I also donated some software from Arturia and Native Instruments. After I gave away the software I remembered I hadn't de-registered it. Kudos to Arturia and Native Instruments for making it a simple and painless 2 minute process to de-register their software. But when I got to the Spectresonics software it was an entirely different story. It's an understatement to say it was a HUGE hassle.

This is when I found out Spectresonics charges $50 per license to do transfers. That's just uncool. I don't know of any other software company that charges such a fee. You can forget ever trying to sell this software. No one is going to be willing to pay a license transfer fee or go through the aggravation involved with transferring licenses through this company. It's guaranteed negative feedback if you attempt to sell through eBay or Amazon Marketplace.

I ended up sending well over a dozen emails in an effort to de-register. They simply wouldn't respond back. I tried several times to get someone on the phone with no success. One of the few emails I received expressed suspicion of my intentions trying to de-register.

At that point I was so mad I didn't care whether they de-registered the software or not. I wrote a scorching email to the clown who had emailed me as well as the company owner, Eric Persing. I pointed out how simple it was to de-register with the other companies and what a major headache it turned out to be with Spectresonics. I also mentioned I had donated the software and how insulting it was to be treated the way I had been after spending $1200.

The people at Spectresonics are clearly too arrogant to apologize. I got a very obtuse email stating the licenses would be transferred and that was it. So it was clear they were getting my emails. They just apparently hoped if they ignored me long enough I'd give up. Incredibly unprofessional and totally lame.

Nearly a month after I first attempted to get the licenses de-registered, I finally received an email informing me 2 of the licenses had been transferred. As if I actually cared by then. The Omnisphere license never did transfer although they de-registered it from my ownership. As far as I'm concerned this company helped themselves to $500 of my money giving nothing in exchange. Most people would describe something like that as theft or bloodsucking. The only thing missing here was the gun.

Needless to say I'll never have anything to do with Spectresonics again. Had I known what I was getting into I wouldn't have considered purchasing their software in the first place. And as a direct result of my experience with this company and their massively overpriced software, my preference is going to be investing mostly in hardware from now on that I will actually own and that I can use in whatever way I see fit.

Unlike software, hardware can last for decades. Plug it in, turn it on and go. Hardware can also increase in value over time whereas software becomes completely worthless almost immediately. And of course it's very straightforward selling hardware if needed. Another important difference is that you can't return software once you open it, no matter how awful it may be. Hardware can easily be returned even after using it for weeks.

Also, if you think about it, eventually software synths will end up costing as much as or more than any hardware you buy after paying for multiple version upgrades. That's going to happen very quickly with this expensive software. And it's money you'll never be able to recover. That's not even considering all the time and aggravation involved with having to pay for the upgrades, downloading and installing, as well as activating and reactivating over and over again.

I'm being VERY generous rating at 3 stars. I subtracted one star for the unintuitive user interface and one star for the fact that the software had to be reactivated every time I went to use it.

The company, Spectresonics, earned a rating of one star. To me the producer is as important as the actual product, especially when it comes to software. And I will always have a problem with companies that charge the kind of money Spectresonics does for their software only to turn around and treat their customers so shabbily.

Shortly after I posted my review, Eric Persing, the owner of Spectresonics came along to do some damage control. In addition to trying to bribe me, he attempted to play down the complaints I had about this software and indirectly accused me of lying that I had to re-activate the software so frequently. It's incredibly ill-advised to throw salt on a customer's wounds. You ought to take a look at what he had to say and my responses. I would describe his efforts as an epic public relations blunder. It's entertaining and informative at the same time. You'll get to see what kind of treatment you can expect if you buy software from this company.",1
6349,"I usually use Evah Pirazzi (Pirastro), but had heard a lot of good things about these new strings.  Since the price is lower than the ones I usually use, I thought I'd give them a try.

A Switchcraft jack wouldn't fit in it at first, so I had to use the trusty Black & Decker Rotary Tool to enlarge the opening a hair. Nothing too crazy, but I can't figure out why they'd use a jack that is smaller than the standard size; guitar cables do not pop in like they should, and if you have to force it, then the jack's pretty much useless. Overall the plate seems to be of decent quality.",1

This pedal is very dark sounding and I think it colors your tone a bit more than say an EHX Good Vibes. It also had a very pronounced ""whoosh"" sound to the sweeping that was a little overpowering. I found that I had to really crank the level knob to get a good sound out of it but maybe that's just my rig. Ended up returning it and going back to my Good Vibes.",1

6363,"I've played harmonica for 50 years and I own hundreds of harmonicas.  The only reason I bought these is because I like to see all harmonicas and I teach harmonica and sell them and give them away.  Real harmonica players don't normally buy cheap harmonicas, which is why there are so many good reviews of this harmonica, they were written by people who don't really play harmonica.

First off, forget about the fact that it says ""Hohner"".  Hohner is one of the oldest harmonica companies, and they were the standard for many years.  They're German.  A few years ago they were bought by a Chinese company, so now there are Chinese harmonicas that say ""Hohner"" on them.  The German Hohners are still good harmonicas.

The case is very nice.  However, this is one of the worst playing harmonica I've ever played.  I've bought hundreds of Chinese harmonica, and this is the worst example I've seen.  They are ""airy"", it takes a lot of air to make a sound.  This might be because the plastic covers aren't smooth, they're textured and your lips don't make a good seal on them.  The reason for the plastic covers is because they're lighter.  I looked into importing harmonicas from China, and the shipping is as much as the harmonica itself, so making it light is important from a cost perspective.

A good player will make it sound good, but he'll hate playing it.  The Hohner Bluesband is another Chinese ""hohner"", and it's really quite nice (they sell them at Cracker Barrel restaurants for $5, but they only have them in the key of C).  Amazon has them in a set of 7 keys.  All the suzukis are good, including the ""easy rider"", a cheap harmonica.

Being easy to bend is not the mark of a good harmonica.  One of my favorites, the Golden Melody, is hard to bend.  All harmonicas bend.  You can play these, I'm not saying they're terrible, the only truly terrible harmonicas I've seen recently were made in India.  The case is very nice.  But there are better harmonicas in this price range.  I'm Harmonica Bruce on youtube.

5-5-2013 - I'm updating my review.  I showed this set to one of my students, and told him they were not very good harmonicas.  He tried playing one, and liked them, and bought the set from me.  Then I ran into a musician friend who dabbles in harmonica, and he likes them also.  They are playable, and cheap, and some people like them even if I don't, so I raised my review from 2 to 3 stars.",1

It was good because it helped me understand about compressors. I then moved to the Modtone Lemon Squeez for about 3 months. I loved this pedal because the pick attack was incredible. It preserved the natural bounce of the string and did a great job.

Then I had a chance to play the Philosopher's Tone and was blown away.

For starters, it added a clarity to my sound that seemed to be lacking with the other 2 pedals. The treble button really adds that special something that you hope to hear in your clean sound through a Class A tube amp.

The grit button is so-so in my opinion. You can dial in a light crunch, but I've tried stacking it with other pedals and it just doesn't stack right to my ear. I can use it as a light crunch if I don't feel like dialing it in on my overdrive or distortion pedal.

6379,"CAN I JUST ADD A NOTE HERE!  The pitch and mod wheels have NEVER worked for me.  Correction:  I bought this locally on KAUAI because I needed a controller that worked with IOS.  I got it home and it does not work with IOS via camera connection kit (too much juice apparently)  I located a powered USB hub and it worked great with IOS synths (and there are a LOT of great sounding iPad synths right now!)  Pitch bend and modulation wheels I THINK worked fine.  I know if they wouldn't have, I'd have returned it PRONTO.  OK so months later I plug it into my newish Mac laptop running Reason music software, which has had a gillion different controllers plugged into it and worked great and NO PITCH BEND OR MODULATION WHEEL with the Microkey 37.  I dig deeper: I scrutinize Reason's control setup, seems fine.  I download the Korg driver for this controller and still no go.  I download and run the korg control software and STILL no go. I contact Korg online and they tell me to do all these three things even though I just said I did.  Korg online service is HORRIBLE.

Thing is, I LIKE these small-ish controllers.  just not the Nanokey's clacky action.  I just like the ability to use pitch bend and modulation wheels as they are (to me) the MOST ARCHAIC AND FIRST EXPRESSIVE CONTROLS IN EXISTENCE ON A DIGITAL KEYBOARD - AM I WRONG?

I scour the net and email back and forth with Korg and I am basically S.O.L. because I cannot seem to communicate that the controllers are not TRANSMITTING data.  I tried several other programs - no work.  I tried several midi monitoring programs and the wheels do not send diddly.

I think that if I were to pick a first-time guitar again, I'd wait and pick up a nicer one for somewhere around the $200 range. Not inexpensive, but not cheap either.

I also play guitar, and wanted to see if the Pykmax would allow me to shift gears and not overreach the strings.  I tend not to watch my pick/plucking hand, counting on it to go where it's needed.

I found the Pykmax doesn't fit well into my hand, because of my preferred way of holding picks.  As a matter of fact, my hand felt slightly cramped while holding the Pykmax, because I have to grip more tightly than I'm used to.  I'll keep working on it anyway, to see if I get into the habit of playing each instrument in a completely different approach.

Finally decided this wasn't for me.  Maybe it'll work out great for other folks, but the way I prefer to hold my pick and the Pykmax just don't mix well.  Besides, the holder always feels too small for my hand, and sometimes cramps the muscles in my thumb.  Not good at all!",1
6389,"I only issued a three star rating to raise a caution flag with this harp.  It is not a typical diatonic harp, and if you are expecting it to sound and perform like one, you will be disappointed.

It is a fine, well-made partially-valved harmonica, and if you desire to experiment with a valved harp, the Promaster Valved Harp is a fine choice.  But, to reiterate, if you like the sound of standard diatonic harp and want a harmonica that will perform like one, this is not the harmonica you are looking for.  It can be harsh and unpredictable in tone and its reeds can sometimes buzz, blurt, or honk abruptly.  I am an experienced harp player and perform regularly. And I have no doubt an experienced player could have some fun with this instrument.  And If you are interested in this harp as a musical experiment, go for it.  But, if you want a good diatonic harp that will play and perform as you expect one to, this harmonica will be a squawky, quirky disappointment.

6396,"The first and foremost thing I can say about this controller is that it isn't exactly reliable. I've had chases randomly be scrambled or deleted from its memory entirely. Chases that I'd used several times before, then I turn the controller on and they're gone, or worse, the output seems entirely randomized. I've ruled out all sources of electrical interference and use shielded cables and proper chain termination, so I've ruled out the chance that it has anything to do with the lighting chain; it's this controller itself.

The sliders and buttons feel cheap; they jiggle in place, and the slider knobs pop off with worrying ease. I am just waiting for the day that something pops off this thing and is gone forever, or for when a vital button breaks and leaves me up the creek during a gig.

All in all, when this thing works it gets the job done fairly well. The music control mode isn't bad, the scene controls work as expected, and there's plenty of storage space for scenes. This redeems the product enough that I'll give it three stars, however I use this thing on the road and its unreliability is unsettling to me. I've had to run my lights on auto/sound-control mode instead of through DMX a couple times now, and it's starting to get a little bit bothersome.

(Something that would be nice but not necessary, I wish this controller had scene buttons to assign presets to instead of having to scroll through scenes in a chase to get to a particular stored scene.)",1

6399,"Sound is really clean but the transmitter battery constantly depletes for incomprehensible reasons. Even when it's plugged into the base, it would sometimes randomly deplete itself.

The signal is also clean itself but leaks tons of noise back through the power line (USB). If you just power this one device via one USB adapter, it's fine. But if you use it in conjunction with anything else (via a hub or a USB battery pack) that are also audio devices, it wrecks signal down the chain.",1
6400,"I received this to day and immediately unpackaged it. It is of a good size as was expected of a 15 inch speaker cab. It looks very sleek and professional. No one will think you paid under 200 dollars for this powered speaker. I plugged it into my living room wall and plugged my EV 767a vocal mike with tc helicon mic mechanic and turned the volume up. I didn't expect it to sound this good. It was not quite as clean as my EV zx speakers downstairs in my music room but sounded big and an overall nice sound. I initially bought this for a monitor for my main PA system. Now I want another to run from a nice non powered mixer. Its just so easy to get a simple set up with great sound with powered speakers. Great speakers on a budget. I hope they last a long time. Its already getting me hooked on powered speaker. Its just easier. edit;After having this speaker for some time, I have experienced crackling with more than low to moderate listening levels. Its fine for a party but not for pro use. Peavey powered speakers at a bit more money is a much better investment.",1
6401,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. The sound is acceptable; this unit is perfectly adequate for use in a live performance situation; much better than an amp's built-in spring reverb. But if you're going to use it that way, get the AC adapter; it just eats up batteries. I got a very high capacity rechargeable 9v battery for it, and it got about 2/3 of the way through a 3-hour gig. Good digital reverb for the price, but don't use batteries unless it's a really short gig.",1

6406,"For the price, this is a perfectly decent banjo strap, but if you're REAL particular, I would suggest looking elsewhere, and here's why . . .

These straps are well made and they'll work perfectly fine on most banjos, but the actual colors are just a bit 'off' from what's pictured here. The burgundy is real-real 'red', while the 'brown' and 'walnut' are virtually identical. In addition, if you're going to want your banjo sitting up higher (i.e., closer to your mid-body, the way I personally like it, rather than down low near your lap), then the adjustment of this strap is going to leave you with an excess flap of leather, essentially waving in the wind, once its adjusted properly. Consequently, if you're looking for a seriously nice strap, for a particularly special banjo, then you'll probably be better off having one custom made at no more than roughly twice the price.",1
6407,"Though this is not a bad sounding microphone -- though that really depends on personal taste and purpose -- and it seems pretty rugged for 10-15 bucks, the one thing that it is not is balanced.  If you open up the unit, you'll see that the wires going to XLR jack are unbalanced (one of the pins is not even used).  This may not make a difference for a lot of people but for some here are the things you may notice:

1.  The output will be a little lower -- not bad but lower.

2.  If you use long cables -- even balanced cables -- you will pick up noise since the signal is not really balanced and the noise rejection will not actually happen with an unbalanced system no matter if you used a balanced cable or not.

You can use it for podcasts if you keep your cables short, or if you use a noise subtraction plugin like Reaper's ""VST: Refir""

It does look nice and will probably do nicely for beginners or people who are not careful.  Just be aware of its limitations.",1

6409,"The Stratocaster is a legend in ergonomic design and comfort. This Mini Strat is a good first guitar for kids...but it's not just for kids. I got mine as an adjunct to my Yamaha Pacifica 112. It's lighter and more comfortable to play. Of course it doesn't feel as rock-solid or sound quite as good, but still decent. In fact, I like its comfort so much, that my 'better' guitar mostly collects dust now.

The weak spot on these Squier Minis are the cheap tuners; some are too tight and some too lose, and one of mine is particularly rough; it feels like metal-on-metal grinding when I turn it. My Mini also doesn't hold tune particularly well, but I suspect this might have more to do with body/neck construction rather than the tuners - but I don't know for sure. But other than that, this guitar has a decently solid feel. There are minor cosmetic imperfections (for example on mine, the neck is offset from the body centerline by a few millimetres) but no big deal.

These Mini Strats are easy to modify and customize; I made a clear acrylic pickguard to replace the generic white one (the body now has more of an all-black look), I removed the neck and middle pickups (rarely used them), will upgrade the bridge pickup to a humbucking pickup, and will be replacing all the chrome hardware with either satin nickel or black.",1
6410,Cheap,1
6411,This amp makes a good practice amp but doesn't have the tube sound that many like myself prefer. With its built in effects it is handy for practice jams or noodling around. It is plenty loud but the clarity is not outstanding on the distortion channels. The clean tones are good but again lack tube tones. Presets are easy to modify and save or delete. I had mine for a few years then bought a tube combo amp and like it better.,1
6412,"OK....... I got the new cup holder out of the package and initially thought, I like it. Then I took in to the studio and put it on a mic stand, still ok. Then I grabbed my drink and put it in the holder. I thought it was going to spill my drink on the floor! It flexes so bad the cup tilts way out from the mic stand. A really odd angle and although I have not had it long.....I don't trust it very well.  I'm sorry but just buy the simple metal cup holder...I won't mention names in case its not ok.",1

It's not that much better than my laptop's onboard sound - sometimes more noisy, sometimes less - but is notably better than the chipset on my girlfriend's netbook.  Still...  two sets of stereo 1/8"" mini to RCA Y-cables (required to hook ins and outs from laptop to tv/stereo) would be about the same price, so it's a fine deal.

Works out of the box with Jack for Linux and Windows 7 as a generic USB audio device.",1
6415,"The actual case is a monster and very well built but also very heavy and large. My pedal board is pretty big and this was the only case I could find that wasn't super or expensive or needed to be custom built that would fit my board. I didn't need the board inside and I contacted Odyssey about getting the case without the board but they said they couldn't do that, so yeah I had to pay for a board I'm not going to use anytime soon but that was okay because this wasn't that expensive.

The board would be a huge pain to use if you were going to use it though. It's pretty heavy on it's own and if you add in the weight of the pedals it would be nearly impossible to get out of the case because there is barely enough room around the edges to get your fingers under the board. You can't use your pedals on the board if it is still inside the case because the front side comes up too high and the top doesn't detach. The only way I can see to make the pedal work is to go out and buy some strong metal handles and attach them to the sides so you can just pull the board straight up and out of the case by the handles.",1
6416,"All the components appear to be high grade but I just can't get the action where I like it.  It's okay.  Much as I hate to say it, it's a value double-bass pedal and that's exactly what it feels like.  It's strongest point is its look.",1

Yes, it can brighten and beefen your sound, but it basically just boosts the high and low ends. You can get so many better sounds from an eq pedal and/or an overdrive pedal. Overall it's ok, but it's really not an essential piece of gear.",1
6423,"The basic thing to know here is that when they say ""Vintage Delay,"" they mean 1950s - early 1960s. The delay times here are very short. It's mostly good for a rockabilly slapback delay. At its longest setting, it has a very 1960s ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" psychedelic sound. One of the coolest things about the Vintage Delay is that it can be thrown into a feedback loop, like an old analog delay, where the delay sound feeds back on itself to make a very distinctively weird sound. Overall I am not sorry I got this; it will have its uses. I just want to make it clear to everyone that the settings here are very short. You will not get a David Gilmour sound out of this one!",1

6430,"Okay ... I was curious about these bulbs, but the price was right so I took a chance and purchased several bulbs to try out at a private evening party. They arrived on time but some were defective. My first impression upon testing the ones that worked was ""WOW, "" They were light-weight and as leds they draw hardly any power and do not get hot to the touch while in use, but the lack of any control to stop the motion of the projected lighting or change the speed or even select colors soon made be dizzy and wore out my enthusiasm. I was able to resolve the lack of an on/off control by purchasing a set of 5 wireless outlets from Amazon. My main disappointment was that these 3W leds were just not bright enough and the area of projection before fading more restricted than what would have wanted for professional use ... but heck ... for the price ... and for the home ... it would work just fine.",1
6431,"UPDATE JAN 23 2016: WOW, this is a very dark pedal... I'm used to Lexicon Algorithms through the digitech polara, which is pristine sounding and very clear, like a strymon. But this pedal I have to say is extremely dark and boomy... definitely loses a lot of articulation... weird since most TC's stuff is on the bright side... I can only see myself using this with  my own tone prints for super long weird reverbs... but for an always on pedal I'll stick to the Polara, I can't believe such a dark reverb is rated so high, I mean, I'm trying to play and makes everything in my studio rattle... which is kinda hard to achieve. since I have it setup in that way... Tone Prints and Editor are awesome, out of the box is almost unusable to me... The Polara has less modes, but absolutely ten times better sounding and it has the shimmer effect and reverse modes... if you have to chose, please get the Polara, better graphics and attention to detail.. comes with a cover so you don't bump the knobs and changed your dialed reverb, a velcro stickers for those of you that use velcro on your pedalboards... TC Electronics is more of a hype machine than a top notch effects maker... I really don't believe when they say no one in the world has worked on more reverb algorithms than TC . For music and for Film... that this is the same as their studio units.... there is just no way...

I don't want to jump to conclusions as I did with TC's Hypergravity comoressor... I was it's biggest critic and now it's my favorite compressor after tweaking it with the editor... That is absolutely essential... Same with this pedal... I give it 4 stars because out of the box I was not impressed by the reverb algorithms ... I usually use the Lexicon ones in the Polara Reverb , By Digitech which is the absolute best pedal sized reverb in this price range.. Strymon being the absolute best of course... But it's at least double the price for the blue sky and more than triple for the Big Sky... But if you absolutely want a prestine sounding delay I would get the Digitech Polara... It's just overall better than this pedal ""out of the box"" but I've been succesful at creating awesome ungodly sounds with the flashbacks triple delay esitor and the hypergravity, So I'm assuming it will be the same with this pedal... The hall, room, plate and spring are all inferior to the Polara's Lexicon power... But by using the editor I can come up with real weird awesome ambient textures that some aren't even reverb per se... I also own the Earthquacker Devices ""Afterneath"" but that's a whole nother beast...
 I gave this unit 4 stars for the variety of modes, stereo in and out, the amazings features you get with downloadeable tone prints and of course... The key to everything TC right now... The Tone Print editor!!! That is where you can really turn this somewhat boring pedal to the big leagues of sound exploration...
 If you want that shimmer effect, and better sounding reverbs go with the Polara.  If you are not afraid to go under the hood and take your time tweaking a real great sounding reverberation. Get the Hall of Fame... And if money and pedalboard real estate isn't a problem... Buy a Strymon unit.",1
6432,"Okay simulation of Drop D, but actually tuning down is way better.",1
6433,"I really didn't need to purchase this.  I tried it because I don't like using the leather string I was using but I didn't like this either.  It just seems to angle my guitar in an odd way.  This is just my opinion on it.  It is exactly what it is claimed so if you want one, go ahead.  No reason not to.",1
6434,"The idea of this is good, but it fastens to your surface with a sticker.  It might be handier if it were more easy to move around.  It doesn't hold very many picks, either, because of the spring action taking up so much of the inner space.  I put the picks in it and I just carry it around in my case.  It's not much more convenient than the little ziploc baggie that I have gotten my picks shipped in.  If it had a magnet on the bag, it might be a tad more useful for attaching to convenient metal surfaces.  I don't have a standard ""guitar place"" where having it stuck to a surface or wall would be convenient for me.  If you do, you might really love this.

The idea is great, and it's well-made; just not as useful as I had hoped.",1
6435,"This is a great value for a beginner guitar. The guitar is going to get me through my first class. It's just the right size for me (I have a small frame) and the acoustics have great projection and timbre. In class, it seems like my guitar is the loudest. The built-in pickup works good but the battery cover won't stay closed. I am going to have to tape it shut if I ever need to use it. The finish on the wood is very glossy and looks awesome though it is slightly chipped where the 1/4"" jack is (No big deal for me). The fretboard is not marked though and I struggle to find notes that are high up on the neck.

Originally, I did not get the digital tuner or extra set of strings but the seller was very responsive and shipped them shortly after I sent my email. By the way, the Crescent tuner is great. It works better than my Snark tuner which seems to be less sensitive to the pitch. The D note on the pitch pipe does not work though I can still tune the guitar from low E.

The item traveled by USPS from California to Pennsylvania and arrived in excellent condition on time. The gig bag is very spartan but was glad to have something when it was raining on first day of class.

Overall, I highly recommend this guitar because of its value, sound, and seller.",1
6436,"SUMMARY
I'd recommend this to someone who is going to play through a solid state amp, and doesn't want to spend a lot but needs a diverse set of effects. If you have not invested in very much ""effects"" gear, this is a good way to become more familiar with what all those pedals you have seen can do and to experiment without breaking the bank. But for the best sound, and if tone is more important than the price tag, I'd still recommend going with a traditional pedal board. The GT-100 build quality is good but the software support is awful and the sound in the end is just so-so. It kills touch dynamics and it kills the use of your volume and tone controls on the guitar to shape your sound.

PROS
* Relatively inexpensive way to have pretty much every effect you could ever want
* A lot of ""ok sounding"" effects capabilitiy in one convenient package. (Decent, not great sounding)
* Smaller and easier to carry to practices/gigs than a large traditional pedalboard
* Avoids the pedalboard riverdance for complex tones
* Has a memory

CONS
* Terrible software...Boss really needs to step it up on this front. The best software is a ""freebie"" 3rd party package...and its only ok. The boss librarian that is included is like a 1980 application. This to me is the biggest ""sucks"" aspect of the GT100 because its biggest pro is programmability, if only the software support was there to make all that capability more accessible and convenient.
* Sounds are ""ok"" but not great. When I went back to a regular pedalboard it was like bringing my rig out of a closet.
* I don't like the ""two pedal"" stomp for tuning. It's actually a little too easy to hit two pedals on stage when trying to switch between two effects and end up with nothing coming out of your rig!
* Learning curve can be pretty steep and the online support is not that great. There used to be a pretty good online chat board, but it got hacked and all the knowledge got lost. So now....harder to get answers. Surprisingly, Boss doesn't seem to sponsor anything like that on their site. So you have to look all over to figure out the best way to do things or what others have tried. Basic operation is easy enough but to get really expert is a chore.
* Boss customer support is routinely terrible, so if you ever need it...good luck with that.

DETAILS AND MY EXPERIENCE
Compared to other multi-effects, I think it is probably pretty good although its the only one I've used, personally. The obvious competitor is the Line 6 HD500, and while a couple bandmates have had these, I don't see that their sounds were any better or worse. My real comparison is to using my traditional pedalboard (I'll call that TPBD from here). By comparison the TPBD sounds far better, but is considerably more expensive, bulkier, and of course incapable of memory and single stomp moves between multi-effect sounds. I am aware of some control/command modules I could add to the TPBD to get there, but haven't gone that route so far. I'm a techie and a gear junkie and while I dedicated a good bit of my life for several months, I was never that happy that it was ""easy to use"" and never was satisfied with the sound.

I had this for 9 months and used it exclusively during that time because I wanted to give it a fair chance and make sure I was coming through the learning curve. I tried a two cable method, 4 cable method, multiple amplifiers, direct to QSC powered monitors, and just about every configuration possible that people recommended. I never could obtain what I thought was a quality sound out of it. On stage, I was frustrated with the way it interacted with my guitar and with amplifiers. In the end, when I decided to pull out my old beast of a TBPD, I was shocked at how much better it sounded. It was like I pulled my rig out of a closet or out from under pile of blankets. Just much crisper, chimier, and alive. The GT-100 by comparison always seemed a little dead. The biggest thing I noticed was how much more responsive the TPBD was to different settings on my guitar -- for instance, the 5 different pickup positions of a stratocaster, and how the volume and tone knobs on the guitar interacted with the rig. Using the GT-100 of killed that - more than I had realized until I went back to the TPBD.

Recently I was in a band practice and my bandmate was using an HD500. We were playing a Pretenders song and he said...how are you getting that chimey clean tone that rings like that? It was because he was used to the digitally processed tone he was getting. He's playing into a great mesa amp and I was playing into a modified blues Jr at the time, but he had a pod in front and I had my TPBD with just a little chorus and reverb turned out. Nothing fancy. I think this summed it up....I just sounded better, even through a much less substantial amp. This to me is the downside of multi-effects. They just don't really sound that great.

On the other hand I probably have $3000 in my TPBD and still don't have some effects like rotary and harmonizer (although I have almost everything else!). Playing a widely diverse setlist can be tricky and require some notes on what effects to use for which songs and how to set them. (this is the ""no memory"" problem of TPBD, and I guess of ""me"".)

I suppose I have (or had) a love-hate relationship with the GT-100. I loved that you can program a specific sound for an individual song, tweak it until you get it where you want it, save it, and have that forever. But I hated that I found it next to impossible to get a really good sound, and it seemed like it took forever to program. I also hated that the second you changed amps...it was a new game, and that you really can't build those patches at low volume and expect them to sound the same at stage volume. You have to get the final adjustments done with your exact stage rig, and at stage volume, if you want the patch to sound good on stage. What worked on one amp sounded completely different on another...so when I went from playing on my own rig to playing a performance on a backline that was provided and had different amps, my tones sucked. Last, I found the GT-100 really killed the way I could tweak and control my sounds from my guitar. The controls of the guitar become much less effective and much less responsible through the GT-100.

What boss really should do is provide online master classes in programming this thing and setting it up, and they need to step up the included software to be a world class software app that can both edit patches, and do the ""librarian"" type archiving, read/write etc and do it better. I found the learning curve cumbersome and I'm a techie, and it's pretty absurd that to control this thing from the PC, you have to use two different programs and one is a 3rd party freeware app. I can't for the life of me figure out why Boss doesn't stop trying to do this in house and engage a real software company to build a quality app for them.

In the end, I sold the GT-100 (today) and went back to my TPBD. I thought about keeping it just for the rotary and harmonizer effects and a couple others,  but I don't want it my chain because of the way it kills the tone and the responsiveness of the guitar controls.

UPDATES:
2017 - I'm told the software is better with Boss Tone Studio and a firmware update to the unit to go to V2. But I visited the Boss website and what stands out to me is that they still don't understand software and apparently don't test it properly. If you have to apologize repeatedly for the inconvenience your product causes, then it's broken. Convenience is the primary reason to own a multi-effects unit, and perhaps versatility/many effects at a relative low price.

6440,"I took a chance with this pickup after buying a Neewer sound hole pickup.  I needed a quick solution to plug in my acoustic guitars to an amp while away from my microphone recording setup.  Clamping this pickup to the headstock is a much better solution than the sound hole pickup.

It is an inexpensive way of amplifying your guitar.  Watch out for the issues I listed below as they are annoying issues.

Pros:
1. Works in all of my acoustic guitars and ukuleles.  Really nice solution of attaching it to the headstock instead of the sound hole.
2. Quick and easy way to connect acoustic guitar to your amp.
3. Inexpensive.
4. Surprised that the one i got has a low noise floor, decent enough to get some audio recorded out of the pickup.

Cons:
1. Sensitive pickup.
Be careful not to hit the cable while playing because it can emit transient noise (loud spikes of squealing noise) to your amp.

2. Too much high frequency, like a tin can sound.
Plugged in directly to my amp, I had to lower the high and middle treble substantially to get the warm acoustic sound I am looking for.

I solved the two problems above by using a guitar pedal before the amp, put a limiter for the sound spike and adjust the EQ to eliminate thhe ""tin can"" sound.",1

6443,"Back in 1993 I bought my first electric guitar. It was a Fender Squier Start in pearl white with a maple neck. As far as I can tell by reading the specs on this one, it's pretty much equivalent to mine.

Well, it's not a great guitar by any means because you're getting what you pay for and you can get one of these for less than 200 bucks, but it's nice enough for an absolute beginner. I'll never forget the feeling of strapping this axe on and seeing my shadow holding the guitar with its iconic headstock. It was one of those moments, like playing your first real gig or recording your first song, that always stick with you.

Mine's already 20+ years old and it's suffered its share of abuse, ranging from a cracked nut to shorted circuits and broken knobs, but it never gave up the fight. It currently doesn't work but if I take it to the shop it'll be back like nothing happened after a few bucks of spare parts. The only reason I haven't gotten around to it is because I own other guitars, including a pretty good Strat, so I don't really need to have it fixed with any urgency. I mainly keep it for sentimental value.

But you know what? It's not a bad guitar at all, considering the price. As I said, it's nice enough for a kid starting out and if you think it sucks, it's probably because you want it to sound like a higher-end Fender Strat despite the fact that it's obviously nothing of the sort and you paid nowhere near what one of those cost.",1
6444,"Too tinny sounding for me. Was hoping they were what came off my Les Paul Studio, but it had a deeper sound.",1
6445,"Seriously, when a cheap wooden / bamboo flute is out of tune, I can see how it is hard to drill holes consistently, and how you may have to tolerate it. But this thing seems to be cast, and still it is totally out of tune (at least in mine, 3d tone is too low, while 4th tone is too high). I can compensate for it by lip-rolling to some extent, but it is rather annoying.

The sound is rather nice, and it has 6 holes all right, like a fife is supposed to have, but because of the tuning issue you can not really play slow melodies on it: you have to whistle some fast shrilling tunes in a hope that nobody will have enough time to detect the falseness =)",1

I brought it to a music store and had a professional look at it and play with it. He played it beautifully and told me that I just needed to keep practicing and nothing was wrong with the horn. He said that it was a good idea to get some new reeds for it, because the ones that come with it aren't good. But other than that, it's works fine and it's a solid horn. I guess if you're thinking about buying this horn go for it. It's a solid saxophone and it works fine for a beginner.",1
6452,I had issues getting this to work.,1
6453,"I had expected it to be pressure sensitive, but it's just a switch.

6455,"If you want to have an interesting echo and repeat, this is worth the minimal investment.  I recommend buying the multi-plug power supply as it goes through batteries fairly quickly and you will likely be buying other pedals to compliment this one.",1
6456,"It was delivered just as expected.  There were no problems with the vendor.  The problem I ran into was that the jack was too large to fit through the f-hole on my mandolin.  My f-hole is 3/4"" and the jack needs about 7/8"".  I wish I had known.  If I valued my mando a little more, I would have just returned the pickup for an external model.  Instead, I drilled the f-hole slightly larger.  The rest of the installation went off without any problems.  I drilled a hole for the jack and fished it through with little difficulty.  We'll see how long the adhesive holds the transducer in place.  I'm thinking a few bumps might knock it loose.  I plugged it in and it worked.  The sound was about what I had expected and about what I had paid for.  A lot of the depth of the tone is lost and come's through in the high-mid range.  It isn't terrible, though.  I think with a little EQ I might improve on the sound a little bit.  I might work on placement of the transducer as well.  There is a little body noise that gets picked up if you bump the instrument as well, but it isn't too bad.

The bottom line is that this pickup does what you expect.  If you want spectacular sound, or have a spectacular instrument, don't be so cheap on the pickup.  If you have a $200 mando like mine, this pickup will probably suit your needs.",1
6457,"Strap is cheap,but for the price it does the job. Single ply, medium weight nylon, good colors. If all you need is something simple, this will do just fine. Great straps ends though.",1

I got Alesis Q88 keyboard, once i connect the pedal, it shuts down! i tried USB power, DC power, same result. I guess it's the impedance of the potentiometer used.  I checked some reviews on other sites, seems many users faced this issue, the pedal works with very few keyboards.

I was about to give it a 1 star as it didn't work as expected, but the ladies in Amazon support team were so kind to give me a full refund including the initial shipping costs, while keeping the product, as the return costs me 2 time the price of the products (overseas shipment), and hence i am evaluating as a volume pedal for guitar and not for keyboard.

As a guitar volume pedal, good grip to the floor and linear volume control, didn't like the plastic feel, and the product is all black, unlike the picture, so 3 stars.",1
6462,"The case body and foam is fine. It fits either Strat or Tele, left or right handed. The handle is large and tough, so are the latches. My only gripe is with the 4 feet on the backside. One broke off completely after 6 months of light use, exposing the sharp screws which poked holes in my car seat. Another is now breaking off (shown in the photo) and the remaining two have cracks in the exact same places (see other photo). I have another case like this, much older and made with the Fender logo but exactly the same, and it's feet don't have any cracks. I take good care of my gear. This case holds a custom-made Strat so I never bang it around or drop it. I also don't leave it anywhere that gets too hot or cold. Maybe this run of cases got feet made of poor quality brittle plastic? I'm willing to just replace the feet and keep the case if SKB will only send them to me. I called Warranty Service yesterday and still waiting to hear back from them.",1
6463,Will not fit large fingers...caution.,1
6464,"I'll echo some of the other reviews here: these aren't actually Schaller-brand strap locks. They are clearly knockoffs. That said, they seem to work fine, but I'd approach them with caution. I've had real Schallers on my SG since 2005, and I've never had an issue with them. I don't know if these will have similar longevity. But, I'm also no longer a touring, full-time musician, so I can't say they'll go through the same paces as the Schallers. One unfortunate problem with these is that they are not interchangeable with a strap that has real Schallers on them. The strap-post on the guitar is too big for the horseshoe from the real Schallers. I put these on my Les Paul, no drilling required, and they seem secure and fit well. Also, no pads were included, so your mileage may vary.

If you're worried, I'd consider spending the extra $4 to $6 on the real thing.",1
6465,"Feels really cheap, but it gets the job done for now. Three stars because it came with two extra bands for holding it in place.",1
6466,The stand is solid and excellent.  My only complaint is that the bag was not included with the item as advertised.  That was disappointing.,1

6468,ok,1
6469,"I have had both the Junior (15Watt) and 30 (30watt) G-DEC's for a few years now.
Both have changed there names and look a little different, and Fender has added the digital readout/select and the expanded 3.0 30 stuff to make a 3.0 15. So what you have is a 3.0 line with digital menus and a junior carbon and a non carbon junior which are both 15's.
Personally, I think they went wrong direction by adding the digital junk to the 15, and what they should have done is add a couple more dial selects (like the carbon and non carbon juniors) to the 30.
If what you want is a small no hassle amp to practice your guitar playing on, that gives you amp selections, effects, and a selection of loop backing tracks to play your rhythm or lead with and is quick and simple to do your selections through dials, has an actual metronome, and won't break the bank, the junior carbon and non carbon is your amp.
If what you want is something to play with through a digital display that take you away from the
main reason you are there holding that guitar, then get one of the G-DEC 3.0 line.
Don't get me wrong, the 30 (or now 3.0 15 and 30) have great throughput and output capabilities, but require a lot of time going through display menus and sub menus to get the job done and while this can be fun, the main reason for both of these machines is to practice your guitar playing, and at the much higher price tag for the 3.0 line, well, it's a no brainer; at least for me who has used both for over 5 years.
Again, all of these machines are for practice, they are not meant for gigs.",1

6477,"It Is What It Is - a cheap audio interface.

I waffled about the star rating on this product more than most; it could have been anywhere from 2-4 stars.

Pros:

Adapt professional type XLR mics to iOS devices.
Phantom power.
Guitar input (not tested).
Small size.
Inexpensive.

Cons:

Headphone jack does not monitor audio being input. Instead, it is a simple replacement jack for the iOS device. It works for playback, but not for recording.

Short pigtail to plug into iOS device not the greatest for handheld use of iPhone or iPad. Awkward.

Plug connection not very confidence inspiring on an iPad 4 with Apple magnetic case. Does not seat firmly, may not be reliable connection for recording. Aggrivated by short pigtail.

Analog audio input on iOS is not global with all apps. Some recognize this input, others do not. Dedicated audio progams seem to work fine. I test and confirmed both GarageBand and TwistedWave. The app I purchased this device to use with, however, is hard programmed to use the internal iOS mic only. This bites because we are planning to use AirBeam to broadcast and record a closed circuit feed of some group sessions, and wanted to use a boundary mic positioned on a conference table for better audio. No go. No fault of Tascam, but be advised to test your specific combination of iOS apps with this device. Unfortunately, there is no way to know without buying all the stuff in order to figure out if it works.

Wash

Some people would downgrade an analog audio interface like this in favor of a digital input device like a USB microphone. My expectations are not super high for a $30 device, but I welcome the option of using something other than a 30 pin connector to connect audio to an iPhone or iPad. For one thing, Apple is depreciating the 30 pin connector, which will render many 30-pin devices to be worthless antiques sooner, not later. For a second thing, my application requires recording video of meetings for 2 hours, and I need the 30-pin so the iPad can be connected to a power supply.

Knowing exactly what the capabilties of this device are, buy it if you need it. I'm sure it will serve a lot of people very well, but if not, $30 is unlikely to be a serious mistake.",1
6478,"For the price this isn't a bad product - but there were issues with the one that I received. The outer keys were reasonably in tune (as much as that might be), but the four middle keys were horribly out of tune. Adjusting them didn't do a lot to make them sound any better (and it created problems with some of the outer keys). I finally got the whole set adjusted to something that I can live with (the longer metal keys still are not very melodic).

I'm satisfied with my purchase, since I'm just playing around with this instrument and it didn't cost a whole lot of money. But if you're looking to use one of these for actual music, I suggest looking for something of a higher quality.",1
6479,"It is what you see in the pic, nothing more or less",1
6480,"I suspect a lot of the 5 star reviewers didn't actually A/B this with a genuine 808 circuit, such as the Maxon OD-808, because compared to other distortions and overdrives, it sounds a lot like an 808, but compared directly to an actual 808 pedal, it's fairly different.

First, the mid hump frequency of this pedal is a lot lower. Where as the real 808 has a nasal mid range, the Joyo is deeper and more throaty. The 808's loud upper-mid hump has an effect of making a single coil sound humbucker-like, but the Joyo Vintage Overdrive's mid hump is more subtly and at a lower frequency, and so retains the single coil characteristic the way that most other ODs and volume boosts will.

The volume/sustain decays a lot quicker with the Joyo, and you can't compensate for that by cranking up the gain, because we're talking about longer held clean tones. Once you crank up the drive on the Joyo to such an extend that it will sustain like the 808, you're dirty sound is now traded in for full blown distortion.

On the other hand, it still sounds closer to an 808 than does a TS-9, so it's worthwhile as a pedal that sits in between the two, more modern than the 808, yet more vintage than the TS-9. I have to give it three stars because people who buy this pedal are obviously going for a particular tone, and this pedal doesn't delivery on that unspoken promise.

If you want 808 tone cheap, get the Biyang OD-10 Mad Drive. It costs $45 and actually does deliver 98%+ of the 808 tone rather than perhaps 85% for the Joyo, and that %15 difference is missed. The Biyang also has a lot more head room than either the Joyo or a real 808, in case you need it for some reason, and a three way switch that changes the pick attack characteristic, from ""bright"" to ""warm"".",1
6481,"One stopped working within 2 months of used and the other is going strong. We used these (and continue to use the working cable) for a bi-weekly podcast. The cables were used for 2-3 hours at a time and didn't move. Needless to say, I'd say that the usage was quite light. The fact that one simply died really detracts from the rating. Sure, they are cheap and I expect them to stop working after a certain amount of time, but two months is simply not a good experience.",1
6482,"While mounted on a stand this thing has a surprisingly decent sound. It feels like playing a conga tough you are not going to get that smooth wood sound or loud fiberglass pop.

You really need a stand to get a halfway decent sound.",1
6483,"After trying out a few other styles and brands, I settled on this stand, wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great, but I had to return my first stand, as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal, and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right, once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly, the replacement unit I received also has this issue, but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish, and truly worthy of my guitar.",1
6484,"Well built device, good customer service, but not the right device for me at all. Tech support was responsive, seller was quick, plenty of good things to say about this.... but I'm returning it. Its a shame, I spent a lot of time on setting it up and I REALLY WANT to love this device. Here are the reasons I am not keeping it.
-Poor windows performance. I do not recommend this if you are trying to use a PC at all. Iconfig utility crashes all the time.
-Requires you to replace your audio driver with a really outdated ""ASIO 4 ALL"" driver (that they didn't even write) that causes all sorts of latency issues. This does not play well with my audio interface. On MAC, you have to combine it as an ""aggregate"" device with your other audio stuff. I don't totally like this either.
-Does not play well with my old midi controller. Yeah, it's old, but it still works.  I used it today with another MIDI interface.
-Overly complex routing software, IOS version is REALLY different interface from the MAC/PC version and is difficult to use. Port names are plentiful and confusing. You can rename your ports (so you can figure out what you are doing)..but this brings me to my next point...
-Unit requires a LOT of factory resets. There goes all my customization and renaming
-Port names are a mess. All over the place. No consistant names across mac/pc/IOS/DAWs

This looked like it would be a home run for me, but it isn't. I am going with MusicIO (Ios app) to connect my ipad to my PC (it works) and will just get a 4x4 usb midi box instead. I wish this company the best of luck in the future, they are really onto something with some of these  forward-thinking features. I think the price and build quality are great.",1
6485,"Before I bought this I recorded on my computer using an interface and on my iPhone with iRig. When I can't use my big desktop computer I prefer to use iRig PRO DUO over this as mine has two inputs that can record on the same track, The Tascam seems to only record one mic on each individual track. So this took up an extra track when used two mics to record drums. I fixed this by  recording drums with two overhead mics that used a Y cable into one input XLR, I used a second channel for bass drum and then bounced them to the same track after getting levels right. This Tascam is okay but I found that it was not as user friendly as a computer or iPhone, especially if I wanted to repeat over a section of the song that I messed up on. It also seems to record microphones a little more quietly (built in and sure SM57 mic). The bass and guitar lines in were loud and clear. There are a couple of functions and benefits to the Tascam machine that are cool. It seems to record more clearly than my iRig did.",1
6486,"The GS Mini arrived with low action and medium weight strings.  However, the bass tone of the low-E string was worse than I expected.  Also, the guitar goes out of tune up the fret board.

The good news is that I bought this as a long term storage solution for my lesser used harps, so it's going to do exactly what I need it to do.  I can't give it more than three stars, though, because I think the travelling musician who is buying this case to take it on the road, to regular gigs, or even to a friends house to jam is going to be disappointed.",1

It only has 2 inputs... both RCA for Left and Right. You need a mixer that will take care of all the recording before hand and have the main outputs bus to these two inputs. Another downfall is that since it DOES only have two inputs (L/R), if you have a whole band playing together at once, you have to do all the EQing/compression before hand for every instrument which requires more external equipment. I got it for my cousin for Christmas and he's limited to what he can use so it worked out just fine, but for bigger situations, this is (obviously) not your friend.",1
6503,"Stock this guitar is OK.Top line non Pro Tone Squire.  It can be made better if you wish to bring it up a few notches. I have always thought it best to buy the lower level models as they have in general the same body , same woods, same neck as the expensive models. They are cheaper.  You pay much less for the basic the go from there. Example: Epiphone Les Paul cost 400 and Gibson Les Paul over 1000 new. Now, you compare both, and you find body and neck the same, so you put in some new pups, great ones, put in Grover locking tuners, put in new custom pots and capacitor, and you now have a Les Paul of the top order. So, the same goes for this model Stratocaster. I gave it 3 stars as is. yet those are well earned 3 stars. The basics are good. However, I would mod it out to American Strat standards. Put in a full set of Fender Custom shop pickups or put in Fralin pickups.  I would put in a 250 orange capacitor and pot set from Amazon, as this will really ad wow to the tone. The 500 pots do not bring out the tone if you ask me. I would put in Grover tuners, a graphite or bone nut,  and now you have a five star guitar reasonably cheap but a above average  Fender American strat to go pro with. A cheap way out of this is to find a used Fender Squire Pro Tone guitar made in Korea in 96-98. These were so good that Fender stopped production of these as Americans were buying these off the map over the Fender American strats. Stock it was just as good,and they had ash bodies for sustain. Pro necks and locking tuners already on them but better tuners are the Tsu. The pick ups were good, just more bright than american strats. Some pros like them. Now, you can get these used for about 250-300 in most cases on line. Read the reviews for Pro Tone on Strat talk. You will see. Now, if you do the mods I did, you have a guitar worthy of what Jeff Beck would play if he were too slum.  After all , he on some recordings uses an old Fender Esquire. The esquire later became the Squire. I did all my mods for about 250 on my Pro Tone. Some are selling for 500 plus but you can get them as stated above. You do the mods as you can afford them. Not hard too do. Straight up though, without being touched, those Pro Tones were good if not better than  american strats at that time.  I will answer any questions on that if you wish. What too use for what sound you want. You also have the options of buying any Squire made in Japan from 1990 to 95 and they indeed have top quality and are sought by many professional guitar players. Peace.",1
6504,"First off, it is capable of getting great sounds, it is  solidly made pedal and the price is great.  If you're a begginer or you're just doing some bedroom recording the pedal is well worth the money.

*The Bad* - the pedal gets ""stuck""-meaning that out of nowhere the knobs will not work at all and you either need to toggle the tails switch or completely power the pedal off to get control back.

The other problem is that the pedal doesn't sound so hot in front of the amp, so if you don't like using the fx loop on the back of your amp (or if you don't have one) you're probably better off buying a behringer delay; they might compress your sound but they're easier to reign in.",1

After talking to Larry Hartke, decided I got a bad tube. He would not send a warranty replacement. My suggestion - new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation. Replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like Doug's tubes, tube depot, eurotubes, or some other reputable tube vendor.

6525,"I got this more out of curiosity than anything.  It's been several years since I've played in a band, but I still like to play around the house with various instruments I have here, a few of which are powered.  I have an amp I generally use for my bass guitar, or even my electric violin, but that's a bit of a pain, has a very short power cord, and kind of limits my position.  And with my 11 year old son always wanting to sing along with movies or TV shows (all the Phineas and Ferb songs that he's into now) I thought this would be something fun to review despite the price (since items aren't free for vine anymore).

It arrived, and I was pleased to note that for the review model, they included the rechargeable battery.  I had figured I'd end up buying that anyway since the price wasn't too bad, but no need since I already have it.  It's odd though, it's got a slot, almost like a PCB in a computer, think like a card slot.  There's the female slot on the bottom of the unit in the battery compartment, and this has the tab that slides into it, just like plugging a PCIE card into a computer.  And it doesn't fill up the compartment, it's a few inches short on both sides, the slot holds it in place.  One of the odder implementations of a battery I've seen.  Most make something that conforms to the battery compartment itself and use the same contacts.  But once the base is back in place it's very solid and won't wiggle.

I had to buy a microphone to test with this since I didn't have one already.  But I did, and my problem may be that I didn't get an expensive one, just a $30 one from the local brick and mortar, but the volume level for the microphone input is very low.  I'm trying to see how I'd use this in a coffee shop or something, and I just don't see it at this sound level.

Then I tried the bass guitar - and THAT worked better, using the same input plug as the microphone, so I know it wasn't a problem with the input plug on the unit.  And it sounded better than I had anticipated.  I really had expected this to be pretty awful for it, but it wasn't.  Again, not something I'd use in a full band gig, but definitely something I can use noodling around the house, or somewhere that I'm the only instrument playing, such as the coffee house I've seen mentioned in association with these.  It had a nice sound, decent level, not muddled or quite as under-powered as I had anticipated.

Next was my electric violin.  And that, too, had a good sound level for something like this.  Again, in a small venue, with just one or two instruments and some vocals, this would work.

But I just can't get this microphone to sound alright with it at all, so while I can't talk about a good level for microphone input, considering that same input did so much better for the bass and the violin, I'm going to have to assume that it's this cheap microphone of mine.

Next was the aux input - worked as expected, with acceptable sound levels.  Again, it's not some audiophile piece of equipment that's going to reproduce the whole frequency range beautifully.  Things are a bit flattened considering the speaker setup.  But it didn't sound BAD by any means - on par with some of my better Bluetooth speakers, but with a bit more bass and fullness.

Then came the Bluetooth testing itself.  I tried with my son's iPod Touch (latest generation) and the Bluetooth paired instantly, no code needed.  It immediately prompted me to install the app, and I did, but the app is a bit of a letdown, no matter what I did, how many times I power cycled the iPod touch or the speaker and reconnected, the app always offered me only demo mode and said it couldn't connect.  It would tell me it's not connected even while I was playing music through it, so clearly there was something going on there.  But the Bluetooth implementation worked just great.  No lag.

The volume control on this unit is a bit off kilter - it's got a very narrow band of response towards the top, and a very low ramp up for about 80% of it's range.  So until you get to the last couple LED's in the volume meter, it's still quite soft.  But the last couple ramp it up quickly to its maximum volume.  Now, that's not a very loud maximum volume, it'll never replace your stereo, but the intended use is for those solo things where it's not competing with other equipment, or in your own house, or outside for playing something.  And for those intended uses, it does seem to do the job well.

It's not too heavy, and I don't have the kickstand so I can't attest to what this would be like up on a pole, but I'm not sure I'd want it up there anyway, too easy to get knocked over.  That's a good bit of weight up high there, not like a microphone that weighs a fraction of the stand's base and so can tip and wiggle and return to the normal position.  But the kickstand would be good for on the ground though, just to get this aimed better.  I found it sounds best when on a table in my house.  On the floor means too much absorption by the carpet.

I even contacted Mackie about availability of the kickstand since at the time of the review it's out of stock everywhere, and they had no real answer, just ""You have to wait.""

My real problem with this is that it worked well for my testing of everything except voice, albeit that's likely my microphone.  But it worked well, not stellar.  The battery isn't included in the retail product, nor the stand, nor the bag.  And I can see the battery being a separate purchase, but for this price, I would've expected the stand and case to have been included.  The app wouldn't connect.  And while it sounded decent for a battery powered Bluetooth speaker, it didn't sound like I would have expected for this price point.  But it DOES have the combination inputs that no other portable device of mine has, so that lifted it from a 2 star to a 3 star review.",1

6529,"It's a nice unit and most persons I know that have tried one like it, so I decided to give it a try. I had to download an update before it started working as expected. Then I didn't like that I couldn't turn off the polyphonic tuning. I tried to use it for acoustic guitar mostly and it constantly switched to polyphonic tuning when I was trying to tune just one string at a time. When I got each string tuned (according to it) and strummed them all the polyphonic would always show some sharp or flat when individually it showed them right on. I tried to contact them or look online to find if there was a way to turn off the polyphonic mode but couldn't find anything to confirm if that could be done. I would have like it with that turned off and I did like using the strobe mode for setting up intonation on an electric guitar (but not for everyday stage use). I decided I couldn't use it on stage where I don't want to be fiddling with something instead of focusing on playing (in tune) so I switched back to a Boss TU-3 that works great for me.",1

I typically wear large gloves only because medium are just a hair to small for me so when I ordered these ""Large"" finger picks I was a little concerned that they maybe to big, I was way off! The fit is extremely tight and after about 1 minute it cuts off circulation to my thumb and finger tips. I've read here that I might be able to adjust these but heating them up in boiling water for a minute and then fitting them before it cools. Hopefully that will help. I'm going to have to hit the local guitar shop and actually try some on to see what fits best.",1

6544,"It's a little noisy and muddy. Kind of underperforms, to be honest. Behringer used to be the craziest new company on the block when they first started. Solid builds, innovative ideas. Now they're sort of beating a dead horse and cutting corners. I've had amps die a few days after purchasing them. And these are solid-state amps, so that's weird. It was due to a bad build according to the service center. So with this pedal, who's to say that there isn't some problem looming in the background that I'll find in a few weeks or a year.

The ""ducking"" part is pretty cool, sounds like an organ or something. And you can have fun with this at home. I can't really get it to work with my live setup but I keep it around for recording.

Worth noting that the ""mix"" knob eats at your volume and tone hard. You really gotta work with this thing to get it to do what you want in a way that is beneficial. Buy it if you got money to blow and want a toy. There's better stuff out there for professionals.",1

6546,"I bought this pickup to put in the middle position for its rail magnets so I wouldn't catch my pick on pole pieces.

Review after about 1-2 months: Medium output wired in series.  Warm, but almost a little dull.  Weak and flat when tapped.  Wired with black and bare ground soldered together, green and white soldered together, and red as the hot wire, which is different from other reviews but easy to figure out.  An inexpensive upgrade to mix things up with higher-gain.  ZERO noise!

After a couple more months: I rewired this pickup, still in the middle, with the coils in parallel instead of series for lower gain and more highs, but it still sounds dull.  To do this, it comes with the green and white soldered together, so I reconnected the white to the output and the green to ground.

After another couple months: The more I play my other pickups (JB bridge and Quarter Pound neck), the more this pickup sounds bland and flat.  It sounds cheap and lacks charm.  Positions 2 and 4 (mixing with the other pickups out of phase) suck the low end and don't add sparkle.
 The high gain sounds lack bite, and the clean sounds lack sparkle.  It sounds even more dull with the phase reversed.

This is probably a worthy first-time upgrade for an inexpensive guitar to get some thicker high gain.",1

6560,"I am a professional Guitar Repairman of 36 years. I work in a busy repair shop and string several hundred guitars per year, so many, that I use a custom 600RPM string winder. I use Daddario strings on all my customer's instruments and also on my own. Daddario strings, including these EXL-110s, have been the most consistent and advanced strings I have ever worked with.

I have a gripe though..... The packaging these ""bulk"" strings come in needs a serious redesign, more specifically the individual tubes that hold the strings inside the box. Often, when you pull a string out like the directions explain, more than one string tries to come out and jams the one you're pulling on. If you then pull any harder to free it, you sometimes damage one or both strings. I've needed vice grips to pull stuck / destroyed strings out. What's worse is, I sell these strings in full sets, so if one gets damaged, I lose a whole set, which ruins the reason to buy in bulk. This is not good!

Daddario knows about this problem and as far as I know, has refused to redesign it. Furthermore, when I've talked to them to explain this problem (several times now) they tell me to ship the entire box back so they can ""determine"" if there's a problem. Sorry, that's not gonna happen Daddario. They are quite rude. I ask any of you who have had this problem to YELL at Daddario about this and refer to this review!

I have absolutely no problem with Daddario's individual packaged sets of strings. In fact, that packaging is as brilliant as their strings are. They use color-coded ball ends to tell you which string is which and they are in a hermetically sealed plastic bag that out-gasses a corrosion inhibitor, thus, giving you a set of strings that are as fresh as the day they were made.

6570,"This pedal worked just fine for several months and all of a sudden just stopped working one day. It was doing weird things like not working in my FX Loop and had a weak unusual sound. The other problem I was having with it at this same time was that it worked with a power supply but not with a battery. So, after plugging it straight into the front of my Randall RD5H and using a battery in it leaving the pedal off, it would allow my signal to go through and amp worked as normal. When I turned the pedal on, my signal would not go through. No sound. I took it apart and noticed nothing abnormal, I'm not handy in this area, I was just curious. After putting back together and trying again, it sort of works. No batteries but with a power supply it seems to be working like it did before. Only it seems that o have to turn the mix and repeat up a little further than before. It also gives me a nice little boost on the highs with it engaged. Sometimes I turn it on and everything on 0 just for the clarity it gives my tone. It definitely works best in the loop of all of my amps. I do plan on purchasing a new one at some point but not this one. Probably spend a little more on something more known for reliability as well as sounding great. Overall, the build quality is good with this pedal. I can't say much for the internals, as Idk what is good and what's not. It looks pretty neat and well constructed on its board though. The input jacks are good and sturdy, I've used smoother though. The knobs turn smoothly as you would expect any other pedal to work. The biggest knock on this pedal and all of joyo's pedals are the battery trays, they aren't great. Just flimsy plastic. The stomp button is pretty loud! Overall, this is a solid pedal at a fantastic price. The battery tray is one of the only noticeable things of less quality than a pedal 3 or 4x the cost of this one. That's not a problem if you hook up to a power block, like I do and recommend by the way. The sound is good and clear both on clean and even with an overdriven, heavily saturated amp. I have another joyo pedal (ultimate drive) and it has held up great and no issues since the day I got it. I actually bought them both on the same day. I would recommend this brand and this pedal to friends or family and will likely purchase another of this brand in the future. Hope my rambling was helpful to some of you.",1

I have used the Cobalt about 4 times and 1 of the 4 sets was faulty.  I am convinced there was a machining issue as other people have had this problem and the customer service rep was leaning that way as well.  Use these with passive pick ups to bring out everything...way too much going on here to use with active pick ups unless you are just awesome because they won't forgive a mistake in tone.  Many of the other Ernie Ball strings are great.,1

CON 1. The unit comes wit absolutely no information about how to obtain a driver when connecting to a PC or DAW. This is a USB driver. My audio interface understands what it is (a midi device), but Windows does not so this is a real issue.

CON2 - The output of the input/output of the device when connected is extremely low. The gain on the unit itself and in my DAW has to be turned up to almost the maximum to get a good recording level. I am not sure why this is happening unless it is related to the USB driver issue.",1

Its not a huge difference and there are only minor differences between the two, but its just an observation. Now, the problems with the actual guitar. The strap buttons are not screwed into the guitar very well, I was trying out my new strap that I got, when I hear a snap and a clink. Thank God I was holding the guitar in my hands as opposed to letting the guitar hang (as the point of having a strap it). So I look down and the strap button is detached from the guitar, lying on the floor. Now that really is not a big deal unless you WERE letting the guitar hang as that would add on to the never ending cash flow put into the guitar. If the strap button does fall off and you avoid disaster you should be able to get a new one put in at your local music store. Second thing; the cord that connects the guitar to the amp - is crap. Again not a big deal you can just buy a nicer one for 10-20 bucks. Third; not sure if personal preference or not, but I don't really like the picks. Fourth; the bridge can be strange with the screw coming out and string buzzing. Fifth; the neck gets warped. But on the flip side its a great guitar for beginners who are just picking up the instrument. Just be prepared to pay a wad of cash to your local music shop.",1

If Amazon used half-stars, I would have given them 3.5/5. I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:

I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the ""pointy-ness"" of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).

If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be ""it depends."" It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.

Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.

I tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me. I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me.",1

The only reason I'm rating it 3 stars is that it is not fast at all to put on and take off.  Nearly impossible to quickly put this on in a gig between songs and have it be as fast as using the NS dual action.  And I don't know what people were talking about that this is easy to use one handed.  I did not find that to be the case.",1

With that said, the quality of the fx are just ok. The reverb is my least favorite thing about this pedal. The decay trails sound cold and synthetic. Zero warmth, and very digital sounding.  The chorus fx are probably the where this pedal shines. The delays will get you by. Eventually, you will want something with more warmth and detail.",1

This product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the 1/4"" port (the product specs does not show or say 1/4 plug port).
My product has an orange USB light instead of a blue one. The support people at Behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo (sounds like BS to me).

The problem I had and the reason I bought this is that I tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a 1/4-1/8 adapter chord. It works but the levels are too low. When I received this, I was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are, but not by much. It is a step up from the adapter, but far from professional. I'd say the level is beginner/intro level sound and quality.

I bought a ""like new"" product describing faded or damaged packaging. When it arrived, the pkg box was dented (I don't care) and product looked new inside. But, all the instructions described a blue USB light and CD of driver and recording software which this did not come with. Behringer gave me a link to download. I assure you it's crapware and beware. For the mac, garageband is far better and easier to use.

The sound quality is good, sounds really good on clean and distortion is not too much different from the stock pickups you get on my gibson SG 2017 stick pickups, except for the neck pickup, running on a Marshall amp.

Same brand (Pyle) amp.) I really expected Speakon connectors here.  It was necessary to modify one end of each cable to work with the amplifier.  That gave me two extra 1/4 inch plugs which was nice as one of the others failed after the first use.  Not a huge problem unless you are expecting plug-and-play.  I'll still give it three stars, because the stands and gear bag seem fine.",1
6649,"This is the first uke that I have ever bought, and one of the only ones I have ever played that wasn't made of plastic and sold as a souvenir. So it's hard for me to say where this falls on the quality spectrum of ukuleles.

That said, I have played a LOT of guitars, basses, banjos, some mandolins, sitars, and other fretted instruments, so I can speak a little bit about general instrument quality. First off: this instrument sounds good and is fun to play. I brought it to a long weekend with friends where I knew there would be several guitars, a piano, a bass or two, drums, etc. I figured a weekend of easy sing-along jams would be a good place to try out a new instrument, and I didn't want to be the fifth person playing acoustic guitar...

So first impression is that it's a pretty and reasonably well-made thing. The nut and bridge saddle as the same kind of plastic as every cheap acoustic guitar. The zebrawood body and headstock laminate are quite nice, and the binding and overall construction are impressive, especially for the price. The tuners seem to be of good quality, and the overall build and design seems fun and inviting to play.

Now, a note about the strings: I don't know shine from shinola when it comes to ukuleles, but these strings, which are supposedly Aquila, seems like cheap stretchy plastic. They will not hold a tune through more than a song. These strings have been broken in to hell and back, they have easily 15 hours of playing time on them, including unamplified with electric bass, drums, and guitar, when they were getting strummed the hell out of. And they have NEVER held a tuning for more than a few minutes of playing. Actually, I don't even know how long they stay in tune, because every time I check, they are out of tune. Maybe this is normal for ukulele, but it drives me nuts.

Also, frets above the 9th/10th fret should be considered as purely decorative. There is no way you are getting a usable-sounding note out of them. But then, I don't think most people are into high-fret shredding on ukulele anyway, so there's that.

Onto the sound and the experience: this is a lot of fun to play, and uke is a pretty easy and accessible instrument, so it makes a good addition to a music room that already has a guitar, etc. Nobody expects a virtuosic performance from a uke, so it's an un-intimidating instrument to give to beginners and friends of the band. It has pretty much a perfect volume and sound, which is to say, it's just a barely audible plinkiness in a raucous acoustic set, while having just enough resonance to accompany a vocal, as a solo instrument.

N.B. if you are a guitar-player like me, looking for a second instrument: chord shapes are different from guitar, so you will want to print out a chart of uke chords, which you can easily find online. You will also want a clip-on tuner, because you will be tuning this thing A LOT.",1
6650,"It doesn't fit in the bell of an ordinary clarinet in an ordinary case.  There are more substantial portable ones out that that are safer to park the instrument on.  That being said, this is the quickest, lightest and possibly cheapest stand available and as a parking place while you are putting a reed on or sorting the music, it works very well.  An instrument should never be left on a stand and walked away from anyway, so this is a reasonable option.",1
6651,"I got this as a gift. I see a lot of people complaining but the thing is you get what you pay for. This mic is plastic with chrome stickers to make it look nice (I was given the chrome mic, not the red or black but I imagine the results are the same) the mic defiantly works however the quality is not that great. If you are using this for a podcast or something similar and you don't need to worry about quality then this mic will be fine for you. I am a rock vocalist and every time I use it I have to bassically make out with it for people to hear me and you still cant hear me as good as somebody next to me usinf a metal mic. In my opinion this is for only 1 person to use becaue of the whole having to make out with it when you use it. You can not have a quiet voice and you can not have any distance between you and the mic to work. This mic isn't bad but you don't sound nearly as good or clear as a mic that's metal.

6659,"Not thrilled with the packaging, since it came in a padded envelope; I thought there should have been either a dowel rod taped to it, or cardboard tube around it to protect it more from bending or breaking in transit, but mine made it through my mailbox pretty well (envelope was bent just above the end of the tipper -- thankfully no breakage at the end.
The tipper itself is pretty good, it's an effect.  Not quite a brush sound on a bodhran, but...
I found one of the bamboo skewers (yeah, it's made out of bamboo skewers!) had NOT been cut or sanded to match the others, and the skewers are NOT glued together under the wrap tape...they can be moved around, which then moves the cut and sanded sides out of alignment, but it can be twisted and re-aligned.
Here's the bottom line... if you're lazy, go ahead and get it...just find the best deal so you don't pay more than the price of the tipper in shipping!!!

If you're not, or are very crafty you can DIY as bamboo skewers are available at Dollar Tree or dollar deals, etc... for ...well, if you have to ask....a dollar plus local tax. (there's about 25 in a package). Add glue, sandpaper and either grip tape or string if you're really crafty, and about an hour of work...

6662,"Been rockin out for 40 years and this is my first all tube amp/head.ive gone through just about every solid state amp out there and always had to supplement with pedals. Well I'm 50 now and I want to sound like me not rock star endorsement poster children. What I've been use to over the years is high gain, compression, and when I go clean wanted depth. I was always afraid of having to change tubes, high voltage, and possible inconvenience of tube amp upkeep. I didn't want to some hundred watt massive stage head that I could never turn up either. All good tube amps with any kind of reputation were just too expensive. Okay....enough dreaming. The reality is this amp filled a tall order in my opinion. Let's start with size; compact!! Fits on top of 1x12 cab. This thing holds 2 tubes for the power section and 3 full size tubes in the preamp section. The transformers are meaty but not too heavy. This is the full Monty when it comes to a rock tube head,but fits anywhere.
Next thing is GAIN!!! It's got it. Wanna sound like EVH? Dimebag? You can. Wanna sound like Dire Straits? Classic Skynard? Clapton? You can. The gain control is wide and spicy, and the clean is deep and crystal clear. This is the first amp I can plug into without any pedals between me and the amp. Look up the specs and functions, there are so many things you can do with this amp, in any situation. So glad I have it. It has an effects loop that I thought I was going to put a chorus into, no way.this amp sounds good with out any effects because it's so responsive and deep.lots of natural compression. The reverb is perfect. I play a strat and it goes from classic rock to modern metal with no problems.
Now then, why only three stars?  This amp has channel switching which is great but there is no foot switch recommendation listed anywhere, not even in the owners manual (no manual included either). So I had to improvise and build one. I'm okay with that because I have the resources and know how, but there are people who don't. So if you are someone who can't make his own foot switch, you are out of luck. One more thing, the gain boost is lame. I don't use it anyway.",1
6663,Too stiff for a pedal board that requires more than side by side arrangement..,1
6664,"I have owned a Behringer NR100 noise reduction pedal for years. Despite the many snobs who trash Behringer's inexpensive products, I find many of their products to be quite good, especially for the money, including the NR100 pedal. Frankly, since I don't abuse my pedals, Behringer's plastic cases don't bother me and don't affect my ratings.

Even though many users state that the NR100 and NR300 are quieter than many other noise reduction pedals, I hoped for more ""hiss reduction"", particularly to dampen the added hiss of a favorite chorus pedal. I purchased the newer model NR300 on that hope.

Unfortunately, my possibly unrealistic hope was not realized.  The NR300 offered no ""hiss reduction"" over the NR100. I did notice smoother and less level-sensitive dynamics compensation with the NR300 but at an unacceptable cost. In my own A/B comparison, the NR300 colored the sound and not in a good way. OTOH, the older NR100 was basically transparent.

Perhaps this audio transparency difference can be explained by the variations inherent in less expensive ""analog"" electronics, but clearly, IMO, ""my"" older NR100 is better than ""my"" newer NR300.

Is there a quality control issue? Possibly. If you purchase an NR300, hopefully you will get a good one and not a dud.",1

6669,it's ok,1
6670,"The internal DR40 mics are very susceptible to wind, so I obviously sought out a windscreen for better recordings outside, specifically when I'm just trying to get some general ambiance.  The windscreen definitely cuts down on the sound, so that's good.  Most of my testing of it came during the winter months, when the wind was really blowing.  There was definitely still noticeable sound, but if it weren't for the windscreen those recordings would've been nothing but noise.  It took the noise to a level that I could work with in editing.  I haven't had a chance to try it with more typical weather conditions, but I'm assuming it will perform even better then.

However, this thing is really annoying to use.  It took me about five minutes to actually get the thing on top, and then you better hope that you don't accidentally touch it too hard.  The elastic is pretty taut, which is good for keeping it secure, but it's also not a very long (maybe that's the wrong descriptor?) windscreen, so if you don't get it on just right it will slowly slide up and then pop off.  It took some wrestling, and some cursing of my fingers for not being nimbler, but I finally got it on.  Unfortunately, you will soon notice that it obscures the headphone jack, and makes using the input switch (line/mic/mic+phantom) a little risky for the aforementioned ""don't touch it"" reasons.  There's really no way to fix it, because if you don't pull the screen down far enough, it will slide off on it's own, but if you do pull it down far enough it starts to mess with functionality.  If anyone has any suggestions, maybe I'm just using it wrong.

I can't really recommend a different product, because there isn't any other option...but this gets the job done.  I would've preferred something that used a suspender sort of system, with two bands that you hooked around the bottom of the recorder up to the top.  Yeah, it would look goofy as hell, but it would be a lot easier to use.",1

You'll need to have either (a) an adaptor insert that allows you to attach to the smaller thread size on the bracket or (b) a second stand to mount your mic or (c) an additional bracket that you can use to mount both the a single stand.

I don't know if I explained that in great terms?

I went (c) and it's fine now.  They should perhaps consider offering an attaching bracket that allows for both standard and smaller size attachments.  I'd bump the rating up to a 5 if they had done that.",1
6672,"This capo is okay. Just okay. It's inexpensive. You can clamp it on the headstock when not in use. It goes on quickly and holds the strings firmly. A little too firmly, though. Tension is not adjustable, and I've noticed some of the strings sounding sharp when I put this on. I think this would be problematical in performance, for example if you had to stay in tune with the other instruments in the band.

If your budget allows only one capo, buy a Shubb -- it is definitely worth the extra money. This one has its merits, but you still get what you pay for.",1
6673,Rubber bands fatigue and break within a couple uses. Holder is good,1
6674,"I don't really notice it making any difference in terms of cleaning or preserving or lubricating strings. In fact, I was so unable to tell that it was doing anything useful at all that I bought the refill and re-moistened the pad just to be sure I didn't get an old dried out one or something. I do continue to use it because other people so strongly swear by it that I figure it must be doing something beneficial--perhaps it does prolong string life. Perhaps what it does is more obvious to people who have sweatier or oilier skin than me.
The microfiber cloth in the handle seems more gimmicky than anything to me. It's a fairly small cloth and keeping it tucked in the handle is more trouble than its worth. Instead I just bought a six-pack of much larger microfiber cloths for not much money and I keep a few handy. I wipe the strings down before using the applicator pad. The pad leaves no noticeable residue that I feel the need to wipe off afterward.",1
6675,"I bought this for my son, who is just starting out.  It works o.k..  On the good side, it feels pretty sturdy, it's chain driven, however under even under moderate use, starts to rattle, become somewhat unstable.  If you buy this, replace the high hat choke, as it will not stay tight on either the slide pole, and will loosen & drop the top high hat in the middle of your songs.

6677,"This does the job, but put a small soprano uke in there and take into account the product is made from a slippery plastic and the uke is bound to fall out. And has tipped out, several times so far. Also, unless using the stand on a carpeted surface (most stages are not) it does also fall over when bumped a bit.  Instruments have fallen out of this often. It seems to hold a concert uke better, but I'm looking into better options than this one here.",1
6678,"I enjoyed this while I had it but unfortunately it ended up cracking pretty quickly (whether that was due to quality or my own style of playing, I don't know). I would buy again if looking for splashes in this price range.",1
6679,It works well but the cost is exorbitant. It was cheaper when I bought mine but now it's up to $18 which is crazy. The listing claims there is 1.5 cc of lubricant. This is impossible because the plunger on the syringe is pushed a good way in when you receive the unit. In order for it to be a full 1.5 cc the plunger would have to be out of the syringe. I don't change strings more than once a month or so and I ran out of this stuff fairly quickly. Meh.,1
6680,They work ok. Don't use unless you are connecting pedals of the same brand because if the inputs are different heights you'll end up with some pedals wanting to float in the air etc. I guess if your handy and really wanted to use these you could cut some wood or foam to adjust the heights of some pedals.,1

Maybe get the next step up, the custom or American stage series cables to get rid of the problem but they will cost you more.",1

Of course my reference point is the kind of double bass that was done back in the '60s (Ginger Baker), which is nowhere near as fast as the stuff that's getting played these days.  I found these pedals to have pretty good built and the feel isn't bad but they were pretty slow and not that responsive when I was playing them individually like a single bass.  Not as quick and fluid as my DW 7000 single pedal, anyway. That's not a problem if you're doing geezer double bass like me, but I'm guessing it would be a problem if you're trying to do any of that heel/toe speed metal stuff.",1

6697,"When reviewing this Dizi I think it's necessary and fair to consider this is under six dollars.  One cannot buy a beginner flute and then complain because it's not a $300 professional model.  That considered:

PROS:
* It's a reasonably attractive flute.  Cheaply made... but not visibly so.
* Well-made for this class of flute and the intonation spot-on
* The blow-hole is large enough and formed well-enough to be easy to play-- a good flute for beginners
* Fingering is close and easy; no extreme finger stretches
* Reasonably good sound (again, this isn't a $300 flute).  I managed to get a clear, vibrant tone with fine reaction to throat vibrato.
* Wrapped to prevent cracking

CONS:
* No internal varnish to prevent rotting or cracking.  No varnish around the blow hole or finger holes.  (ie... cheaply made)
* Made of decent quality bamboo but not great quality (this is expected at this price)
* There is no membrane, glue or instructions included-- but none are promised at this price.  If one wishes these items, a more expensive kit would be necessary.
* Whether your flute plays well or not will be luck of the draw.  Quality control and quality of bamboo are not major considerations in the manufacture.

GENERAL NOTES:
It is evident this flute is intended for those already acquainted with the Dizi flute and how it works... especially classrooms where a teacher is wanting to introduce the instruments to students at low cost.  The downside is that if someone buys this ""because it's a flute and it's cheap""... they are going to be very disappointed.  A dizi will not play at all without a membrane or piece of tape in place over the mo kong (hum hole) below the blowhole.  That means that uninformed beginners may give this one star because ""it doesn't play""... when actually it may play rather well once tape is placed over the mo kong. The lack of a simple sheet of paper explaining this is in my opinion, a considerable marketing error.  Another marketing error is not slapping a piece of tape over the mo kung to start with... if for nothing other than to avoid upset customers.

I recommend a modest investment in a more advanced instrument (which starts at about $20 to $30... cheap enough for anyone to afford).  That is very inexpensive for a good musical instrument and you will be far more satisfied with your purchase. If you want to learn to play the dizi, spend $20 or $30 and get a decent-quality instrument.  You'll be much more satisfied in the long run.",1
6698,"I had this Shure cartridge when it first made it's debut. I'm gonna be nice and say that unless you have real old records, worn out records, the stuff you would never play on high end expensive equipment, then this cartridge is your answer ! If you use this on pristine records you will definitely hear the shortcomings of this cart with regards to tonal, frequency, and sibilant accuracy. It's not going to perform anywhere near Shure's other two high end audiophile carts with regards to tracking and overall clarity and sound quality...You really get what you pay for with the

The good- for the money it's a nice hardshell case although it is outfitted as a case in this price range will be.  The latches are not the beefiest.  The internal padding is minimal.  The exterior workmanship was actually nice but the structure of the case itself does not provide for protection if shipping as airline baggage.  It's just too flimsy.  But for everyday transporting your guitar, it's perfectly fine given the cost.  Want better-then pony up more money for a pro level case.  BTW..I have 2 other ChromaCast Electric Guitar cases (non-pro level) and would say the exact same thing about them.

The bad- the price on Amazon seems to change almost daily on this item so you have to hope to catch it at the low end.

The summary- I would buy again for the everyday use I'm looking for.  If I'm flying with my guitar, I'll purchase a better case to protect it from baggage handling.",1

6709,"We have home parties alot.....

I had a cheap 400 watter that did the trick using Froggy's Swamp Juice, but it eventually died.  No doubt from using too thick of fog juice.  BUT, I absolutely swear by Froggy's.  If your machine can't run it, get a better machine because Froggy's does an amazing job filling the area with fog.

Anyhow, this 1200 watter pushing Froggy's Backwood Bay juice cut at 2-3 parts juice to 1 part distilled water is really something else.  I hit the button once and the entire party area is filled - about 900 square feet.  I have to turn off the smoke detectors or it sets them off.  If I hit the button 2 or 3 times within 30 minutes, you honestly cannot see 10 feet in front of you.

I tend to hold the button down until it cycles off.  Wait about 15 minutes and do it again, but note that the machine is ready again in about 5.  Then maybe once or twice more over the next couple of hours I cycle it again.  Then I unplug the machine and just let the fog hang in the air and eventually dissipate after maybe 4 hours from that first hit.

Put the right fog juice in THIS machine and it is the bomb!  Fills the room with fog that has great hang time and, cutting it with distilled water, it really is cost effective over the cheaper stuff.  The right machine and the right juice, cut down = 5 stars all the way!

Bad things (sorta):
1.  Had to move the fogger about 20 feet from the action as the fog shoots out really far with FORCE.
2.  Must turn off the breaker and unplug the smoke detectors.  They will surely trip.
3.  Placement is a bit difficult given the size and weight of the machine, but especially the 20+ foot stream of forceful fog juice that comes shooting out the machine.

Lastly, I don't care about a timer.  Since I only need to hit the button 2 or 3 times total over a 4 hour period, a timer isn't warranted.

Update: I finally installed it.
Screw it down until the 'nub' makes contact with the wood, then using a pencil you can outline the hole to drill by rubbing the lead all around it. When you unscrew it the hole will be perfectly outlined. You can also press down hard and the 'nub' will make a small dent in the wood.",1

I am just getting into guitar pedals again and have been watching some pedal reviews on this brand (and others) from a user on YouTube - EytschPi42 - whom covers a lot of ground when it comes to pedal reviews.

Needless to say, I bought this pedal knowing the pretenses of it's low price; but for the price it's not terrible - better than no compression. The ""Attack"" knob - which separates this knob from the original MXR Dyna Comp - is really kind of a small punch or gain effect, and is not my personal taste (I just leave it at the lower end of the spectrum). Even with the ""Sustain"" knob activated to it's fullest potential, it's not that great of an amount of compression.

Having purchased this, I can't even get that much money back from anyone else who would be interested in buying it - unlike other pedals, which can be used as assets for trades or buybacks.

With that being said, I am still a fan of JOYO and will just try other pedals. I am super pleased with the ""Sweet Baby"" Overdrive pedal! (Check the review)",1

The foam is a good texture if that word describes the open cell nature in that it's not overly rough as in holes too big to be a rough texture but it's not smooth like closed cell foam. It's a good balance between those two extremes. The fit on an SM58 is fair. It moves around a bit rotating on the wire mesh windscreen and as a result is often askew or slightly tilted and not straight on. (If crooked pictures hanging on walls bugs you this may be a constant bother.) Then, at the bottom, the skirt doesn't taper to the mic body very cleanly and just kinda hangs in mid-air around the mic body as if it doesn't know where to go. The over-all look then becomes a bit awkward and unpolished to the mic. It would be better if the bottom of the foam were sculptured to angle in and taper off more. As to discoloration of the sound, I do sound for TV and can hear a bit (just a bit) of muddy tone with the windscreen on vs with it off, but only with headphones. When used with my QSC system there's no detectable difference on or off the mic over the PA to my ear. As to effectiveness, yes, it blocks wind including breath pops for a tangible difference with it on the mic. So overall it's a good purchase just with a few limitations. It's cheap though.

The larger ""body"" pocket is fine for cables (not always needed with acoustic) but is not large enough to hold a regular size folder or 3-ring binder (1 inch"") or standard 9""x12"" music book. So for a case that's advertised (see video)as ""carrying everything you need"" and ""you don't have to burden yourself with other stuff"" Or ""pockets for everything you need... if you're going to a lesson or going to a gig"" it falls short.

Bottom line: I bought it because it fit my parlor guitar.

6743,"The ProDX8 provides almost all the features I was looking for in an 8 channel mixer.  Unfortunately, this unit falls short in a few basic ways.  I hope that Mackie can rectify those things in the next revision.  Because this is still a solid unit.  It just needs a few improvements.

DURABILITY

For starters, the mixer body exudes quality.  It has a solid hefty build.  Most of the body is encased in black steel (powder-coated?) with 4 rubber feet on the bottom.

When you think about the people who would want to use a unit like this, small / independent bands or DJs have to be a big part of the population.  Both of those groups are going to have issues with the power cable provided with this unit.  It is the opposite of professional grade.  It is a consumer grade power cable that may block other equipment when plugged into a power strip, and it is definitely at risk of being easily broken in most gigging situations.  The instructions warn against this.  But it's pretty unavoidable when you have a product that will appeal to a mobile audience but the power cable is designed for workstation use.

LOOKS & USABILITY

The front has a glossy  face that may wear worse, but definitely makes the unit look more attractive.  All the controls on the front are simple and intuitive.  Each channel has a button number which can easily be selected by pressing, and ther e is a dial to raise / lower the levels.  There are also some basic FX built in.

A dedicated headphone connection is available on the back, with a selector button on front so you can make adjustments to it.  There is also a channel (with rubber footing) so that you can place your tablet or phone inside of it.  More on this below.  For basic mixing, this unit is very well designed for use from a physical / ergonomic perspective.

SOFTWARE

For those looking for more of the kinds of controls and bars that a traditional mixer offers, extra features and a more involved interface are promised with the app (advertised for both iPad & Android phones / tables).

However, there is a problem.  I could not get the app to work.  I just couldn't get any of my devices to connect via Bluetooth to this device.  Without the app, this unit is not nearly as useful as what I needed.  I will continue to try to sort out why this hasn't worked, but note that up till this point I have used this without the app.

CONNECTIONS

This unit includes 2 outputs, a main out and an auxiliary out.  Each has a right and a left channel to be connected via 1/4.  There is also the standard 1/8 headphone connection on the back.

There are six normal XLR inputs, which are advertised as also working with 1/4 inch connections.  That will cover most connections that people have for instruments and such.

But there is also one regular 1/8 inch line in.  That 7th channel is also noted as being available for Bluetooth.  Because the app uses Bluetooth for the user interface, it's unclear (but seems likely) that only one connection may be available at a time.  That means if you do get  the app to work and plan to use it for the user interface, this #7 channel may not work with a separate Bluetooth streaming device, or a line in connection for that matter.  If and when I get the Bluetooth to work at all I will update this review.

If I had one wish, it would be that there would be a model of this mixer with more 1/8 inch connections.  I could use at least 4 of those in addition to the XLRs.

CONCLUSION

This is a great device that offers a lot of promise.  Till I can get all the features to work I will not be able to fully judge it against that promise.  Stay tuned.",1

The gbgs moonflower effecct is a red green blue and white 64 led monster beam moonflower.

It creates bright beams of lights in random patterns and also spells out words of some sort.

This is a very nice fixture for dj who aren't using dmx for this fixture does not have dmx.

The fixture has sound active with a microphone and sensitivy nob on the back.

The power cable is connected to the fixture.

The only down sides I have for this fixture is it not having dmx and the power cable being connected to the fixture.
Other than that this is a great little fixture for djs

I give the GBGS Moonflower Effect a 3.5 out of 5",1
6745,"I've tried several spring reverb pedals and this one is the closest sound yet to a tank in a small pedal form.  It has all the same knobs as a tank, has the appropriate ""wash"" sounds when the knobs are cranked, and the volume knob can boost your sound into a mild drive if you want it to.

The problem is, once you get past the initial vibe of it, you eventually want a sound that you can settle on and start playing music instead of tweaking knobs all the day.  I found that the milder settings were not quite accurate as even a built in reverb (let alone a tank), and the higher settings were just too much.  The ""6-6-6"" sweet spot on a tank seems about the perfect sound setting here also, but the problem is that the most sought-after ""drip"" sound only comes about on the higher, more harsh settings.  Had they been able to put a ""drip"" knob on the pedal to adjust this, it would have been ideal, but it quickly becomes a trade off between what you can tolerate from a harshness vs the rise of the drip sound. Eventually, I found the higher level sounds to be very fatiguing after awhile, so much that when I went back to a standard hall reverb on my amp I first thought something was wrong with it because the shrill quality was not there.

I will also warn you that this pedal does not play nice with higher gain pickups.  I tried it with Seymour Duncans and it was distorting pretty badly.  I also tried it with a Gretsch with TVJones Power Trons, and those were better but the tone was kind of meh and I had to turn the volume knob on the pedal all the way down.

Unless you play out, otherwise need a substitute for a tank, or just like having yet another reverb pedal, I would say skip this one.  I give Catalinbread a lot of credit though, as the pedal is otherwise solid and well built.

Close, but not close enough....",1
6746,"Hello,

The desire was to use this device to reduce the length a belt pack had to have between the M1 receiver and the inline amp. The issue is that a loud static/feedback with little volume comes out of this device. This is sad. A VOM does not show any connection shorts or breaks. This is puzzling. Solder joints look good. Very puzzling.",1

6749,"These strings do not sound that great, in my opinion, I like Martins or Elixirs.",1
6750,"I got this to mount a rolls PM351 to a mic stand. It worked but I had some issues with the PM351 so I tried out a behringer, but the behringer doesn't have a clamp I could find so I tried this and ... it doesn't work well. Big surprise.

Now I know this is not intended to be universal, but with a small change it could be. Instead of individual holes intended to match the Rolls units this could have a hole at the top and a hole at the bottom with a long, thin slot between. This would let several different pieces of equipment from various brands fit.

That isn't the reason I knocked it stars though. If it did that it would probably be 5 start despite the other issue, which has been noted in other reviews.

The clearance for the clamp is VERY tight when mounting to a mic stand. Originally I put it on a boom mic and mounted it to the lower portion. It wouldn't fit over that so I had to unscrew the tightening nut and slide it over the upper part of the stand then down onto the lower part. I didn't like how it fit even then so I had to take that apart again and mount it onto the upper part of the stand (not the boom though because that would throw off the balance). I'm not 100% in love with how it is in that position but it seems to work and my bass player isn't complaining so I guess it works.

If someone from Rolls reads this consider my idea for the universal slot. I'd buy a dozen of this kind of clamp if it has the universal slot.",1
6751,"It's ok.  The cutters and winder work fine and made changing strings a snap, but the peg puller is a joke.  I took a couple small chips out of my peg holes when the puller slipped and didn't hold the peg.  I think buying one of the made-for-the-task peg pullers would be a better approach",1
6752,"Meh, not sure it's worth the money.. Ordered a pack of these picks at the recommendation of Ben Eller and well - was hoping for better.

To me, these play and respond very similarly to the Fender Heavy picks which I was using for decades in order for me to get the type of Rock Guitar response I'm looking for with regards to picking. A Pro regarding this pick is that they have the nubbing that lets you get a better grip - which is certainly nice and a bonus, however, I don't feel that it justifies a x3 - x5 price multiple. Got a white JEM-JR and this pick leaves loads of black dust all over it - way more than the Fender. Perhaps it's the carbon, or perhaps it's the fact that it's just more noticeable. Either way, they don't seem to last any longer than the Heavy Fenders at 1/5 of the price and if you periodically washboard it down the low strings, you'll grind channels into it much like the Fenders. Don't expect them to be any more durable. With the price multiple, you're really paying for the extra GRIP.

Was a bit disappointed in this recommendation by Ol Uncle Ben. However, he redeemed himself with his next recommendation, the Wizard Pro by BHL Guitar Picks. I was looking for something that would never wear out and thought that it was a pipe dream - these suckers are as close as you're going to get. Using the same pick now (the Wizard) for months and months.. The same pick!! It doesn't even appear worn. It's custom made by some dude halfway across the planet and they cost near $10/ea. That's a stupid price - but I'm sayin', it's still going. Edge is still sharp just like it was the day it showed up (sorry the review seems to have shifted). Grip is awesome. Only downfall is the material is NOT conducive to sliding the pick down the strings (the washboard thing I referred to earlier). Although it hasn't worn a channel into the pick (Wizard), the material from the pick doesn't grab the windings on the strings like the Pickboy or the Fender and therefore doesn't create as dramatic a sound when doing that - so, if you're frequently into that sort of thing, you might stick with these.",1
6753,"I like the 10 sets, and it may be my imagination but I still prefer DRs over D'Addario. I throw these on my frakenstrat and my hollowbody. for that heavy and/or jazz tone.",1
6754,A little to stiff and not stretchy enough to be truly comfortable. I have another neoprene strap that is far more comfortable.. I just have to figure ut wh made it so I can buy another one. Unfortanetly this one wasn't the same.,1
6755,"I got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp. Like the other reviewers on here, I'm sad to report that it's quite 'hissy'. I had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is. I'm using a Line 6 Uber Metal, Boss Metal Zone, Ibanez LA Metal & Boss Compressor/Sustainer with my SKB pedal board. The board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up BUT when I put the EQ700 in with the others, there's a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp (I'm using a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo) above 4, you can definitely hear the hiss. Not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but I'm going to give the Danaelectro Fish & Chips (as recommended by another reviewer) a try.

I'm waiting on the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and HOPING it isn't hissy like the EQ700 is.

I will say though I do like the tone influence this pedal has. It does a nice job of altering the tone & gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds.

Overall I give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars.",1
6756,I opened one of the set and saw that it was way two hi of a profile for my guitar. I spend a ton of time and money tring to figure out how to cut it down. It didn't come out too well. I opened the second one to compare and discovered that the second one was a much lower profile. I call SD and they fixed it right away. Great customer service.,1
6757,"I shouldve done my research with this product. It does everything as advertised which meets the 3 stars; however, to go above expectations, I needed something more diverse in regards to tripod width range. The fasteners only provide a snug fit around larger tripods, could not use with my smaller ipod/camera tripods.",1
6758,"It doesn't work nearly as well as I hoped it would, but it has served its function adequately. Please note that this includes a mic stand adapter screwed into the included shock mount. You do not need to buy a separate adapter, contrary to what some reviews say.",1
6759,"You get what you pay for with these.  I had this for more than a couple months, but it started getting scratchy about halfway through it's life, and now it's dead.  At this price point, you could afford to buy two or three of these every year, or you could just spend 3 times as much and get a better quality cable that will last many years.

I will say that I tend to give cables a fair amount of abuse- so if you're really nice to this, it might last you a lot longer.  But if you're in any type of a band/gigging situation where you're really using them a lot, I would look to something more well-built.",1
6760,When I bought them I was having trouble with losing my pick while I played. Less of an issue now. Not really happy with the sound they have on the strings.,1
6761,Ordered Fishman. Better product.,1

6763,"Bought this for cheap mics for karaoke nights at my house.  They worked ok for about a year, but one doesn't work anymore and the other have to switch it on and off to get it to work, Ok for kicking around but would depend on these mics for any kind of serious work.",1
6764,"When I first saw this strap, I thought it would be similar to my nephew's new Planet Waves strap with a rotating clip that securely locks the strap to the guitar. Sadly, this is not that type of design. It is a friction fit that requires a bit of pressure to insert and even more to remove. Once on, it appears to function reasonably well and would not accidentally come loose. That is good but also not as good since removing the strap takes a bit of effort. I found using the heel of my hand to push the end out worked the best. On my Schaller equipped basses, this was not a problem. On my guitar kit Fender Strat copy made of cheap lightweight wood, it caused the strap buttons to slightly loosen. This is not good.

The strap itself is a basic web design, nothing particularly noteworthy. The buckle, however, is in a poor location if the logo is towards the horn of the guitar/bass. It is located right on my shoulder and is a bit uncomfortable. It may be that I am just used to my old strap that has sheepskin to pad the shoulder area. It would have been nicer too if the logo was actually a pocket that could hold a few picks.

I will leave this on my cheap kit guitar and stick to the Schaller locks and leather straps for my basses.",1
6765,"I bought this years ago and installed it in a Pignose G40V 40-watt tube amplifier. This was a major improvement over the stock speaker that came with the amplifier, but over the years I feel as though the speaker never really ""broke in."" It always sounded a bit stiff. Granted, it was wired to an amplifier packed with Chinese tubes and a Chinese transformer, but still... the amplifier itself sounded quite nice when plugged into my 2x12 Celestion-equipped cabinet.

So, what you get with a Ragin Cajun is a speaker with a lot of bark. It's LOUD, and it's midrangey, and it sounds like it would be a good choice for a harmonica amplifier, or for someone who plays blues with a brass slide, or a semi-distorted Dobro kind of a thing. Get the picture? Think CCR or George Thorogood. Cajun is right. It's a definite swamp thing.

That's a very particular sound, but what I wanted was something a lot sweeter. I knew nothing about gear back then, so I bought something that was 10"" and advertised to have an ""American"" sound. If I had known better, I would have called the folks at Weber Speakers and talked to them for a while. But I was young and foolish and didn't have a lot of money. This was a good speaker, but I don't think most players will prefer the tone it offers.",1
6766,"if yours comes with a clear plastic cover, it will scratch your git. so if you use it,slide it from the pick guard side. these are surface scratches but who wants that.  throw the cover out.",1
6767,"I like it particularly for its ability to transpose but it's harder to read than its less expensive cousin from Korg that does NOT transpose. This has nice input/output jacks and replaceable batteries that can be recharged. Its cheaper alternative has better back lighting and is MUCH easier to read. Unless you have a strong need/desire to transpose, I recommend the cheaper one which includes a metronome function. I suspect the electronics guts/audio sensor/internal mic are the same and perform equally well. When I'm jamming, I always keep the less expensive one in front of me to see what concert pitch note is currently being heard. Other street musicians will often come over to check the tuning of their instrument. This is SO much better than the cheap tuners guitar or banjo players have clipped on the necks of their instruments. It has a MUCH wider range of notes it will respond to, and is more accurate. It's NOT good enough, however, for tuning your piano. It's excellent for tuning your sax/horn.",1
6768,I tried using it to have my mic go into some guitar effect pedals but it doesn't work.,1

6771,"Finally I got  a Shofar without defect. Unfortunately I had to purchase/return several before this one showed up. It's not perfect but nothing really is. It has a nice twist, a functioning mouthpiece area (could be a little wider). But at this point, I'm tired of trying for better. My main complaint is that I purchased a 14""-16"" and it took several attempts to measure it from tip to tail before I finally found an angle that was 14"" (most were between 13""-14"". I would have liked to have received a larger instrument -- more in the middle between 14-16"" than a skin of my teeth, barely in tolerance in the category. Makes me feel a bit cheated.",1
6772,"OK for a kid's toy.  It is well made.  It is sturdy and there are no sharp edges (in case you were thinking of giving one to a kid).  And it is not shriekingly loud.

On mine the slide makes the slide-sound for 2/3rds the tube length.  The other third is just a wheezing noise.  It won't work for the theatrical sound-effects purpose I bought it for.

On the other hand, it was not described or sold for that particular purpose.  I was trying to avoid buying one of those professional $20 swanee slide-whistles.  When I get a swanee I will give this to a kid.",1
6773,"The product description states that it works on a Ukulele, which is why I purchased the item.  The items is just too large for a Uke (used on tenor).  It seems to be well made, but I would not recommend unless you are using it on a much larger instrument.",1

6781,"This is a well-made product at a great price but it's not really a strobe light.  It's LEDs that flash quickly.  They really should call this a flashing LED light not a strobe.  I'm never going to get an epileptic to seize with this thing.  The product works, but I don't see how they can call this a ""mini-strobe"" light.  My LED flashlight will flash this fast and I don't call it a strobe light.  I do mount it on my Chauvet light tree or place it under my drummer's kit for effect in a small club.  Just don't expect a real strobe effect.  I didn't expect much, so I wasn't disappointed.  I would give this four or five stars for price alone if they wouldn't have called it a strobe light.  It seems well-made, as are all the Chauvet products.",1
6782,Exactly what I needed but wish the base was wider. Not easy to bend low while balancing from having it topple over.,1
6783,"For the price, what can you expect? Saw a lot of good reviews for it.  It is a very noisy guitar that when you play a note there is a lot of feedback and inadvertent reverb.  You can here your fingers slide on the strings echoing through the guitar; the neck must be hollow too.  It;s hard to play single notes without hearing yourself barely graze another string.",1
6784,"I purchased this cheap package to have a guitar and a little amp that I can leave on a stand and plugged permanently, getting dust, rain, snow, tornadoes, etc. All my expensive guitars are in a case. My amplifiers and my large pedalboard are covered. It feels like it was taking forever to set everything up for a few minutes of practice. I just wanted a cheap practice set that I can just walk by, grab the guitar, turn the amp on and play right away. I am now playing more often.
The guitar is ok and the neck feels good, although action is pretty high and there is no way to achieve the measurements suggested by Fender. I have the tools and gauges to properly set up the neck (as I did with my other guitars), but this one will likely require some fret levelling. Not worthy to spend the money here as it is still ok for practicing purposes.
The satin neck is a must. My American telecaster has the same neck, and playability is not compromised by glossy finishes. The pickups are acceptable and you can get nice tones with all setups, except with the bridge pickup alone (too bright). The bridge is ok but I had to set it up as a floating one and install the 4th spring that came with the set. The trem bar is just a bit stiffer but I don't need to tune the guitar every minute. The tuners are solid. I will likely change the strings with my favourite Elixir. The guitar has a nice sunburst finish and it was made in Indonesia. Finishing is good. Hey, it's a Squier/Fender with amp for less than $200! Note that many guitars made in Asia have better finishing than some guitars made in the US. I have seen some expensive US guitars with finishing flaws. Go figure.....
The amp sounds nice for its size. Another reviewer was correct by saying that it gets buzzy at high volumes. But think about this as a practice set. It provides that Fender clean sound and some mild overdrive. This is a bedroom and practice set. My kids love to play and that was another reason to but this cheap set. I told them to play the guitar anytime they feel like. It will likely look like a road worn guitar soon, but it's soooo cheap, who cares!",1

I might just get those speakers that attenuate the volume in another cab, as this seemed too good to be true. My only other tube amp with an effects loop is an hour away, and I'm not sure if I want to risk using it on my vintage 5150. I bought two of these at the time, and we couldn't get the other one to work on my Dad's Mesa RoadKing. I have a Vintage Peavey Butcher head, but I'm sure that doesn't have an effects loop.

I was hoping to use this as a one stop solution for a few effects following my pedalboard. I was hoping I could get good delay, synth, and a looper out of this and still maintain the tone provided by my other pedals. As soon as I ran my other pedals through this and put a delay on, all of the nuance and tone from my rig was sterilized. I fiddled with it for 25 more minutes hoping a different delay patch would help or mixing the wet/dry would help. Didn't help enough, the tone leech is unacceptable.",1

6794,"I'm in a group that does a lot of cruises which means carrying very minimal gear.  All 3 guitarists in my group bought these because for size and features offered, you could not compare.  Sadly, the 3 of us have stopped using them. After a dozen or so shows, we all found the sound a bit too ""thin"" overall.  I'm sure that having more 'tweak-time' would help, but on the cruise ships, there's not much time for that (we are guest performers, not ""crew"" - one show per cruise) and we never know what kind of backline there will be until we go to sound check.  Lord knows these little pedals are incredibly compact and packed with features; 5 different levels/kinds of distortion (depending on which of the 3 you combine}, reverb, and delay that will simulate old-time tape echo with flutter that produces a chorus effect.  The engineering feat in getting so much into a pedal the size of a spaghetti box is to be noted, but there's just something lacking in overall 'warmth'.
UPDATE
I've continued to use the RK-5 now for the past year.  Because of its incredibly small size, I've been able to incorporate it into a MOOER 6 pedal case with 3 other mini-pedals (and a LINE 6 receiver circuit board underneath the pedal case floorboard!)  I still struggle a bit with getting the 'warmth' but I'm acclimating.  One criticism I do have is that when the RK-5 is powered up, it defaults to ALL effects/processors ""ON"".  Be so advised that if your amp is on when you power up, it's going to be all 3 stages of gain slamming the input.",1

6814,"Man!  I hate to say this, but you'll save some grief if you'll get the Fender PT-100 Pedal Tuner.  I have several Behringer items which I like.  This item is cheap.  Plastic rather than metal.  The battery cover is the pedal.  You have to punch pins in on both sides to get the cover off.  I took the screws out to figure this out (should have read the directions :-/).  Obviously, it's not obvious.  It also seems complicated to me.  The Fender is straight forward.  Plug it in and go.  This one has too many adjustments and buttons and settings.  The blue ""on"" indicator is so bright it makes it hard to focus on the LED that reads your key.  It actually leaves a little blue dot in your vision for a few moments.  It did not want to pick up the 5th, low C string on a 5 string bass.  It did fine on a 6 string guitar.  No, I didn't buy them.  I helped a friend set some up at his church.",1
6815,"First - I love Music Nomad humidifiers - I own one for each of my guitars. What I was disappointed about with the uke humidifier is that it is a bit too small. I'm sure they were trying to create a one-size-fits-all humidifier but there is a huge range of sizes of ukes. If you have a tiny uke this will work well. I have a fairly large tenor and a baritone and it just doesn't last as long between ""fill-ups"" as my Music Nomad guitar humidifiers.",1
6816,"XR12 looked like it was exactly what I needed... until the network didn't work at all. Tried the reset, ethernet, reboot, nothing for about 20 tries and 2 hours of wasted time (I am a former network engineer). The wireless access point did not broadcast. Had to returned it as defective. Now I'm a little nervous - I do big seminars, and if a WiFi hiccup knocks this thing out, that ain't gonna be good. I understand that you can use the LAN connection, and your own router, but that's kind of weird. Going back to my Focusrite 8x8. Hoping the next gen has at least a real mixer option (without effects) that works offline. Nice try tho. I like where this is heading. LOVED the USB record option. Really wished it worked.",1
6817,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage, it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small ""thumbs up"" to Amazon.",1
6818,"I'm rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR (4) picks into it when it snapped apart. I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.0 mm picks and perhaps that's where I was at fault - I maybe should left it at three picks.

However, my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely. Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holder.

I give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated.",1
6819,"Doesn't fit that well,

6831,I got this for my Yamaha YPG-235. It comes in a box disassembled with a very unhelpful guide on how to put it together. I tried for about an hour and ended up handing it over to my husband to figure out. The stand is sturdy the knob a little finicky...made in china. Oh well does it's job.,1
6832,"Now if you purchased this for it's uke like characteristics in hopes to sound like a Hawaian uke player,  you already lived in a pipe dream. What we have here is a pretty good Les Paul miniture copy for looks. The acoustic side of this instrument is just not there. They have a smaller than normal sound hole for a concert size and alot of lacquer applied for finish. It's built so tough you could probably break some heads with it. 4 screw bolt on neck! Mine came with the pickguard in the gigbag and it's staying in there.

Get yourself a little clip on head tuner and leave it on the head..these use Nylon strings and they tend to stretch quite often.. that said..

The strings it comes with are chit.. they will also slide while tuning. The tuners are questionable but do work. The headstock is a beauty.. Epiphone Les paul all the way! The maple top with vintage burst looks fantastic and the mahogany body is as solid as they get. Intonation and action totally blows on mine. I will attempt sanding the bridge a bit when I change out strings. I already feel some dead spots higher down the neck so the frets will probably need some dressing if its worth the trouble. The fret ends are not sharp and feel pretty good all along the neck. BTW, the neck is thick and u shaped .. think half a bat..  The first section works fine and I can kinda get by with first 9 frets for what I use it for. Strap buttons are installed and will be needed. This little sucker actually has some weight to it and cannot be held comfy like a regular ukulele without a strap. The jack output is set low on the side and makes it a bit awkward to ""me"" setting the uke in your lap. This is not a well made model as the price tag reflects, but is a very pretty Uke sized instrument.

Where does it shine?? In the pickup connected to a cheap Danelectro ""honeytone"" amp playing rock music.. try some stairways to heaven with the Honeytone set to brit lead and you will grin from ear to ear just as its setup out of the box even with the bad strings!!

Buy this for 2 reasons.. 1) you love the Les Paul look and want a tiny one. 2) for the pickup playing ROCK not Ukulele Hawaii..

If you wish a concert sized instrument for Ukulele sounds.. buy a Kala, Luna, even a Kohala... btw, that cheap KP-C Kohala actually sounds pretty good.. even better once you change strings.. but none of these look like a Les Paul..",1
6833,its still a little noisy.,1
6834,Does not really do much it seems.,1
6835,"While this player doesn't have any real bells and whistles, it works, which is the main point.  Yes, the mic volume is low even at the loudest setting, try to turn the music volume down on the remote, it brings down the music volume but leaves the mic volume up.  I have an old style stereo, and a new flat screen that I hooked it up to (stereo for sound, tv for lyrics).  It will sort of lock up playing through a whole cd at times (lyrics will stop, but music will continue).  I assume this is due to it's memory getting clogged.  I just open and close disc, and restart song, and it seems to work fine.  If you are buying this for the 100 song disc, don't, get a better rated player and get your own discs, the songs all have singers on all of the lyrics (but try the MPX button, I never tried it, but it may be a multiplex disc).  Not to mention the quality of the songs is very bad.  Mic is ok, average at best, and the usb port and microphone jacks are now located in the front of the machine, a definite plus.  You can rip only the audio part of cdg's to a usb thumb drive (according to manual, I haven't tried it), no graphics, so if you wanted it to digitally store your cdg's, forget it.  It reads my sandisc and patriot thumb drives nicely.  Recording feature is nice, bad quality, but can be useful for those trying to ""train"" themselves.  The key adjustment is just horrific, it slows down or speeds up music to match keys, so don't even bother with that.

Update:  Cd tray stopped opening, I can't return it as it is past 30 days, so I decided to take it apart.  I checked to make sure all wires and connections were tight, and moved the internal part of the power cord to a different position.  It works well again.  I hope this is helpful for anyone who is having this issue.

Update again: CD tray issue once more, the super-fixer hubby fixed it this time (he messed with the little drive gears in the tray), and I haven't had the issue since (of course, I circumvented this issue by putting most of my music onto thumb drives).  I have noticed since the hubby messed with it, no more cd lock-up issues either, strange but I am not complaining.  This player can read mp3+g format and avi, so it is pretty versatile for an inexpensive player.  Get small thumb drives, if you use an 8 gig, it will take forever to read it before loading, I suggest 2-4 gig.  You may have to use more, but it saves on the start-up time.",1
6836,They look nice. But they are.. too... fluffy for any real sound dampening.,1

6840,"Bought this to work with my new $500 GLX-D wireless, which is outstanding in every way...except that you only get a straight cable with it.  So I had to buy this overpriced angled connecter to use with my Flying V's.  I like to gaffer tape the cable behind the guitar so it looks clean, but the cable is a good 6"" - 8"" shorter than would be ideal for just about any guitarist, I would think.  Then there is that finicky, proprietary 4 pin connector.  THE weak part of the model.  I have gaffer taped the cable connecter to the unit to make it as strong of a connection as I can get, as I move around A LOT on stage.

And if I remember right Svetlana was even cheaper, and I even got it with balanced triodes. So, I'll take Tungsol back out and put Svetlana back into play. Not all that bad news, as I'll keep this Tungsol as a decent backup; maybe use it for V2 someday. Good thing I bought only 1",1

6849,"This does lay lower than normal fog, but it dissipates very quickly. within 2 minutes it's almost completely gone. I also made my own ""Chiller"" out of an old wet-vac hose and a 5 gallon bucket filled with ice. I routed the fog out of my machine through the hose to cool the fog and make it lay lower than the surrounding air. The fog comes out cold, and helped a lot with keeping it low to the ground, but any type of breeze at all will dissipate the fog. I used this indoors, in my living room actually, and the fan from a playstation was enough to move the fog around...It was a pretty epic game of rockband with some laser lights and fog though.

I'm using a very basic fog machine, but that should be irrelevant. A bigger fog machine will make more fog, but more fog will not necessarily last longer, it is just more fog to dissipate at the same rate.",1

He played my violin and the sound was very impressive for a $10 fiddle and a cheap bow.  So all in all take it to a musical store and make sure it's not you but the product.

The chassis is solid and compact, and it weighs next to nothing.  Overall it's a killer little amp, and better than the ID Core ones. Just don't expect Mesa Mark V level of tightness and clarity.

My primary complaint is that the amp is on the darker side and the ISF control basically is a lower/mid control that does absolutely nothing for the brightness overall, especially on the clean channel.  The lack of a general tone knob is pretty unforgiveable in this day and age. To improve the tone, I replaced the stock speaker with a Celestion Eight 15, which helped the overdrive tones a lot but not that much for the clean sound.

I've read that people are using clean boost pedals to brighten up the sound, but for the amount of money you have to invest for that and the speaker I would say go for the HT-5R or one of the ID Series amps instead since they all have EQ controls.  If you're fine with the stock darker sound, then this is the amp for you.",1
6853,"Alright.

I received this bodhran in the mail recently after purchasing it here on amazon.

What happened:

I opened the abnormally large box, and inside was this drum. Overall, it looked like cheap junk, with this lovely ""made in Pakistan"" sticker, that instantly caught my eye. After spending 20 minutes trying to figure out why people in Pakistan are making Irish musical instruments, I turned and looked towards a set of bagpipes I have, that suffer the same fate. Another point that entered my mind, was the Royal Enfield motorcycle I have falling apart in my garage. (India, but it's next door, so we're totally counting that)

Moving on.

Enclosed in the abnormally large box's smaller box that the drum was in, was also a somewhat professional looking user manual??? That was handcrafted by the lovely people at Trinity College (wherever that is. Most likely don't have a masters program). The manual/this is who we are manual, basically said that they don't give a single crap if anything included breaks. From what I gathered from their terribly stated Oklahoma doctrine of some sort, in the event of nuclear destruction, they may CONSIDER sending you a new head.

The little beater thing that I forget the name of, is of extremely weak sauce. It is most likely made from balsa wood, and you could probably get better results from a Fun-Dip dipping stick or microwavable burrito.

I retrieved the beating device, and struck the Pakistani drum. There was this awful sound that it produced, that reminded me of someone dropping something very cheap and large. Upon further inspection, it was discovered that a section of the head was very loose. (I believe that the person who assembled it, was rushing to grab a cigarette). I soaked the head in water, and let it warm up a bit on the couch at room temperature. When I picked it up, it sounded slightly better, and the loose area straightened out a bit. After it continued drying for a bit, the lunch meat looking fold returned to haunt my dreams of making this thing playable.

So I decided that perestroika was in need.

I went to hobby lobby, and purchased a very nice set of tacs, as well as a roll of industrial strength hemp. I went home, and very carefully removed all of the microscopic tacs from the drum and removed the head. I gave the rawhide a lovely bath in Western world warm water, and carefully removed all of the shameful, poor quality residue from it. I left it at 22C for 22 minutes.
While the rawhide was receiving its bath, I took the drum itself, and filled all of the awesome cracks in the wood with wood glue, as well as jammed some wax and glue up in the cross section to prevent rattle. I sanded the surface of the wood, and removed the discrepancies that looked like they were attempted to fix using 20 grit sandpaper.

After the rawhides bath, it was placed back on the drum, stretched and tacked on. I instantly noticed that the quality increased five fold, by my divine hands touching it. After it was blasted with tacs, I wrapped hemp around the outside edges, to ensure that no rattle would come from the edge of the hide. I personally thought it was a better solution than the wood glue that was slapped on it in Pakistan.

After all was said and done, this poorly made drum, sounds like something that could summon angels.

Job done.

All in all, if you have the time to do all of the crap I did, buy this thing. If not, I suggest you cough up the quid for a nicer one.",1
6854,"Works great for six string instruments, but loses all note separation on 7 and 8.
Similar to the Mesa dual rectifier, it has its own voice.
It's less fizzy top end and has a little more midrange punch than the dual recs I have owned. At $699 I had waited YEARS for it to arrive. As soon as it was in stock I grabbed it. Unfortunately, I left it in the box as I sold another amp to pay for this one, so I lost some money on the return.
Why did I return it?
It worked great with my six string guitars, very punchy, not 'quite' as much gain as the Mesa, but very good and tight.
However, as soon as I plugged in my seven string, things changed. All my other amps have worked just as well with 7's as 6's. But this amp somehow lost all note separation in the lower register with power chords and open string riffs. I tried backing off the bass, tweaked all the eq knobs, played with gain and presence, but could not fix it, at 5 weeks it went back

If all you use are six string guitars, this may be the amp you are looking for, but if you play extended range guitars, keep looking.

I'm a female guitar player. I returned this and bought the Oscar Schmidt instead. It does cost $130 but I just love playing the ukulele now! I have taught myself a lot of fun songs. The kids like ""Campfire Song"" Spongebob best. I pick this uke up all the time. I'd rather play this than the guitars. It's because the Oscar Schmidt sounds so much better!

The only downside is the way they tend to get ""curled up"" when you're playing a gig and switching guitars two or three times a set (I go back and forth between a couple Teles and an acoustic). Just picking the guitars up and setting them down again is enough to get the cords all twisted up, not with each other, but themselves. As some others have mentioned, they just don't want to lay flat. I have to spend a few minutes at the start of every set ""spinning"" my guitars around to get the loops out of the cords.

And it does that trick really well.  However, I began to want to use it for it's tuning function.  This is where it began to fall apart a bit.  The lower ranges of tones were not even registering on this device.  Even the low E on an acoustic guitar was too low for this pedal.  The accuracy of the tuning is also coming into question for me.  I have tuned on the pedal to where everything said it was in tune but when I used a Snark or the onboard tuner, it would say that the tuning is off.

6871,"I will let you know that I've been using boom stands for 35 years and that I write this so you can make an informed decision. I'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.

I see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good. I particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom. It's a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give. The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and I'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it. I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses. The boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand. On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9701B-Pro-Tripod-Microphone-Boom-Stand/dp/B0052TGJOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom Stand</a>&nbsp;Just like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at Amazon today I'd probably buy the 9700&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MS9701TB-TeleBoom-Microphone-Stand/dp/B003GU3RII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Stand</a>&nbsp;or this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DR-Pro-Mic-Stand-Telescoping-Boom/dp/B003G45V1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boom</a>&nbsp;or maybe try this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hosa-MSB-521BK-Mic-Stand-with-Boom/dp/B0051PM12E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hosa MSB-521BK Mic Stand with Boom</a>

I haven't tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I'd be inclined to give it a try. I think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice. I'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is. Ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately. All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money. $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination. As for the cheap cord clips, just forget them and buy these, they'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent (no leftover duct tape glue).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Velcro-Reusable-Self-Gripping-Ties/dp/B000F5K82A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Ties</a>

But understand my position, I've got stands purchased 20 years ago that I can still use and don't feel the lowest price is always the best value, but you're intelligent so you know an $80 stand used for 20 years is $4/year, I use stands almost everyday and I don't think this would last me a year and maybe only months.

2. You don't plan to adjust it much and

This stand could be fine for you now if you can't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some. I did give it 3 stars but 2 are for the product and 1 is for the price. So I hope all of this helps you with your decision.

6872,"I bought this for my sons to share with their new acoustic guitars.  I have a hunch that this would work wonderfully with anything that you could plug into it, but we've had some trouble with tuning the accousic guitars with it.
1 - it only registers the sound about half the time
2 - the instructions are vague when dealing with acoustic guitars
3 - I am no master musician... but when the tuner says it's in tune... ANYONE can tell it is not.

I believe that the problem may just be our unit, and may be in the mic... we don't have any electric guitars around to test my theory on.",1
6873,"The mellow sound and good intonation are belayed by really heavy construction and plasticky finish.  The strings are set really wide at the saddle and makes the strings come really close to the fret board edges.  There is some buzzing on the C and E strings.  Sounds better with martin m600 strings, but also starts sounding like a guitar.  There aren't as many frets and some other concert size (12 vs 16).  The body is also really thick.  The saddle is compensated.  The action a little high.  The tuners are great and smooth.",1
6874,"I bought three of these stands. They work, but the bottom part that the guitar sits on.. the ""fork"" should be a bit more sturdy.
The quality of the stand does not equal the price I paid of them.. it works.. but sorry not worth the price.",1
6875,I like this shorter slide version. I would give better rating but I ordered a small and couldn't get on my size 8 ring finger. I think slides should provide their internal size.,1

These come standard on most taylor I believe. Never noticed any taylor being too uncomfortable.... YMMV.",1
6879,"I bought this boost to use in one specific situation. When playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down, my volume drops quite dramatically. This boost does what it says it will do to remedy that, but it also seems to add a lot of noise. When the boost is off, my super high gain Fryette Deliverance 120 is very quiet when I just hold my hand over the strings. I'm using a 2010 LP Custom with a stock 490R pick up in the neck and 498T in the bridge. When I turn on the boost I immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise. When playing it isn't so bad, but I definitely am not used to so much extra noise. There are a couple of adjustment switches inside, and I haven't fooled with those yet, but I'm definitely going to do that. This boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound, but if you've already got pro quality stuff I don't see too much of an advantage here.",1
6880,Kind of thick around the neck... Uncomfortable,1
6881,"I purchased this pedal recently, and found that it unfortunately does not meet my expectations and seems to be a waste of money. Perhaps this is just because of the tone I'm looking for, but none of the pitch shifts really fit my sound very well and the whammy effect doesn't sound very much like a whammy bar. It's not the best thing for my setup, but it's probably a very good one for yours!",1
6882,The bow would be suitable for student use.  An experienced violin player would probably not wish to use them. They are priced accordingly and the service and delivery were very good.,1
6883,"This is clearly a powerful analog synthesizer for a great price, but I still found it to be far too complicated and limited. Trying to get the hang of this unit reminded me of an old quote about helicopters, ""For every hour you spend flying, you spend 4 hours on maintenance of the aircraft.""

This is not a unit you plug in and play right away. You have to create your sounds from scratch, and that takes time. I'm admittedly a novice, and I found that it took a lot of time making adjustments before I came up with a sound that was pleasant or usable. There's no way to save sounds you like, so you must use a paper overlay to note the position of the knobs, sliders, and switches.

If you're willing to commit to a bit of a learning curve and to spend the time dialing it in, the unit will produce some very authentic analog sounds. Personally, I'm going back to try the Korg MicroKorg. It's a little easier for me to get the hang of, it can be powered by batteries, it's polyphonic, and you can save your favorite sounds and quickly access presets.",1
6884,"I got a batch of these to try out, mostly for the better grip. That is better, but these picks are much brighter and clickier than I want. I normally use the normal Dunlop 1mms, and I really like them. These, though, are just too sharp on the attack. Not for me. Grip is definitely great, though.",1
6885,"I got this for the kids to play around with. It's okay, not great. If you're looking for a keyboard to actually play, steer clear of this one. The keys are very tight (hard to push down), and they click really loudly. And the weirdest thing - volume will randomly change! You can be in the middle of playing a song and it will just jump up 10 notches and scare the crap out of you. The record feature is a joke - unless your plan is to record about 3 seconds of music. I would exchange it for the other one I was looking at, but it's not worth the trouble since we're really just using it as a toy. If you're looking for something to just mess around with, it might be okay for you. If you actually want to play music, forget this one!",1

6888,"I bought one because one of my students had one and it looked pretty slick. It is handy and it is just slightly better than the first generation of intellitouch tuners from ca. 20 years ago. However they aren't great.

Tracking of low frequencies is very poor. It will never grab an open B without a FretWrap to dampen the odd overtones, and then only half the time - on all kinds of basses. You have to use harmonics.

Also the tracking is much much slower than ideal. E.g. the tracking in MIDI converter boxes like Roland and Axon is near-instantaneous, which lets you tune extremely quickly. Snarks are slow enough that I wouldn't take the time to check tuning between songs.",1
6889,"Don't get me wrong the tone of these strings is quite good, and they hold their tone for a long time.  However, I will never be convinced that a coated string sounds as good as an uncoated string.  If you are a heavy practiced these strings will begin to shed their coating over time.  You will see little bits of the coating start to collect underneath the strings on the body, then the string begins to feel very strange.",1

6891,"Was a pretty good pedal for the price, good quality, many features...but the core of a pedal is in the bearings and mine started to squeak something awful in a couple of months. It also was not as smooth or as fast as the vintage Pearl I had in the 70s. But in all fairness it is still a very well made product as many of the Pearl devices are. Maybe mine was a fluke, but again, in spite of various lubes...IT SQUEEEEAKED.",1
6892,"The USB interface works for recording, but don't bother with the instructions and software included.
I followed the instructions exactly for Windows XP and it wouldn't work. Having read some other reviews, I uninstalled the provided software, went to the ASIO4ALL website and downloaded, then installed that driver. I left the USB plugged in, even when the install said to unplug it and the install worked fine. The provided Audacity software is several version old, so go to Audacity's website and download the most recent. Everything should be good to go. I run my guitar through my fender amp and then into the USB and the quality is good. There is just the slightest delay (I haven't played with the settings yet), but it's not that noticable, so I may not bother. The recording is relatively noise free. Don't bother with the 'Amp' software that comes with the USB device. The sound through it is horrible. There is static and all sorts of crap. So, long story short, get the proper driver from ASIO4ALL, load the latest version of Audacity, leave the USB plugged in, and you should be good to go.",1
6893,This is not a perfect cube. The periphery on one side is 10 10/16 inch and on other 10 14/16 inch. I've hard time printing labels for it. It also came with scratches on it. Looks like that the production machines are not clear.,1
6894,"These are great strings, but when I was putting them on the guitar, the B string snapped. It may have been my error, I'm not sure. I still think that these are great strings that are worth purchasing though.",1
6895,It's been doing it's job.,1
6896,"It does a decent job, for the most part, but the build quality is a bit cheap and navigating the functions are needlessly convoluted.",1
6897,"Clean sound, but the digital effects are not variable mixes like those on a VOX amp. No auxiliary inputs, (except an 1/8"" MP3 player hole than can possibly be used for a powered mixer input).
Has a stompbox pedal capability that can save settings , but the settings are on a gradual knob between chorus-phaser-flanger-delay. There are no switches for these settings, they just meld into one another as tou turn the knob, and crunch, blues, or distortion are not available.
I guess  I will be building a board full of stomp pedals and patchcords after all.
If you want to get patched in with a band's mainboard you will have to do it through the stereo earphone jack instead of a line-level 1/4"" output.
There is no space in the back for storage, and no microphone plug.
Next time I think I will buy a big VOX, because my little Vox practice amp has everything that this thing doesn't, except the programmable switch pedal capability. ( The pedal is on backorder from Japan with an estimated time of a month for delivery)",1
6898,I don't recommend this for dry climates as you will be filling it everyday or two.,1
6899,"The strings that came with my Martin 000-15M sounded bright & clear. I liked the sound.  But just for the heck of it, I decided to try these Polywebs.  After about 10 minutes of playing, I realized that these strings were not meant for the guitar that I put them on.  I noticed that these strings were not as bright and they didn't have that nice ""ringing"" tone that the original strings provided. My Martin sounded lifeless.  I then installed a set of Ernie Ball 2150 Earthwood Phosphor Bronze strings. The brightness and the fun is back.
I know that Elixer makes great strings. They sound great on my electrics. But, these Polywebs just didn't work out on my particular acoustic guitar.  Keep in mind that my rating is for the Polywebs as they sound on my particular guitar. Your results may vary.  Next time, I might try the Elixer Nanowebs which are supposed to sound brighter.",1
6900,"I'm modded these because I couldn't get them low / close enough to my bottom keyboard. Drilled lower holes for the cross telescoping brace and the adjustable arms. That worked nicely. But, the cross brace, and this is my second KSA7500, falls apart. Others have shown photos where the plug on the end, the one with the threads inside it, pulls out of the tubing. The cross brace fell apart on both KSA7500s. Looks like a pressure fitting is used where there should be a spot weld.

I also shortened the length of the arms by cutting an inch or so from the front so that the top keyboard would line up better with the bottom. So if you're not afraid to do a little bit of drilling and cutting, you can make these arms work really nicely for you.

I'll also tell you that I replaced my first KSA5000 because the arms were uneven, that is the top keyboard was a lot closer to the bottom keyboard on one side. More than I wanted to try to correct.",1
6901,"I was not looking for any improvement in looks, I was merely trying to get this old guitar to play again. My Memphis LP was falling apart, being kicked around, and then in the closet for a LONG time. These replacement covers were just to replace those that were broken. They do look cheap, and I wouldn't use them on any quality guitar, but for what I was trying to do, these are fine.",1
6902,"To everyone who keeps saying they do not fit, here is the reason. Most modern strats have a pole spacing around 52mm, sometimes the middle pickup is 50mm. These covers are a mix: (1) 48mm, (1) 50mm, and (1) 52mm spacing. These will not fit most strats unless your spacing is 48/50/52mm. Measure your covers from the middle of the first pole to the middle of the last hole. If it varies 1 7/8"" (48mm), 2"" (50mm), and 2 1/16"" (52mm), these will fit. If it is 2 1/16"" (52mm) across the board, these will not fit. Make sure you measure ALL of your pickup covers as they may vary in size. I have rated these with 3 stars only due to the lack of information given by the seller. I couldn't find any with a 52mm spacing and I took a shot in the dark. Unfortunately, these were 48/50/52mm and do not fit my strat and I will be returning them. Please make this review ""Helpful"" that way other buyers can be informed of the different sizes.",1

6904,"Most reviewers are correct, that it does not do a great job of rejecting ambient audio, so it's really got to be used in a properly prepared studio.  Sound great, but I returned it in favor of using my Sennheiser 416 instead.  416 also sounds great, but rejects ambient sound better.",1
6905,"The pedal works well. I paid $50 for it and it's worth it.
I bought it because the reviews were so high and it was so inexpensive.
But I'm not loving it. I already have a Fulltone OCD and I think the OCD is worth the extra $75 (they go for about $125).
To be fair the SD-1 isn't 'worse' to than the OCD, just different. I don't think it's as versatile as I thought it would be. It definitely adds a mid boost to the eq (not that that's bad) it also seems to drop some of the lows and highs (also not necessarily bad).  It's definitely not a transparent or sparkly overdrive. In my opinion it's more of a distortion pedal that sounds less heavy-metal.
I might use this with my telecaster to make it sound fatter. I bought the Boss DS-1 recently and I LOVE that pedal. So maybe I was expecting the SD-1 to blow me away and it just didn't.",1

6916,Very sturdy build. Doesn't take up much floor space.,1
6917,"It looks like some people are lucky, and they get a clean-sounding version of the Black Finger. Not me. Adding the pedal adds some very unwanted hum to the amp. It can be minimized by playing with the pre-gain and post-gain control knobs, but it's still there. I definitely expected higher quality control from EH. I've read that this pedal works a lot better with an active instrument. I happen to have a passive bass, and the sound is far from ideal.

That said, I still find a use for the pedal (I only paid $100 for it, though). It gives a lot of flexibility with tone shaping and it interacts well with my distortion pedal. It definitely colors your tone, but not very significantly. It looks cool, but is also pretty bulky and the special power plug makes it not work with standard pedal power supplies.",1

6920,"I thought Seiko were a great brand, but I have to admit that I have a Fender tuner that cost a lot less than this, and it is a much better product than this. I cannot recommend this product, as it is really not good enough. It is much more difficult to 'hang' on to the needle position, which seems to wander about aimlessly. Also the case cover fitting is tacky and it is likely to fall off, and it also made me wonder why they put it on the device in the first place. This is a very competitive market and I believe the Fender one is far superior as it is made of steel and very solid. The killer one for me is that you can now download a tuner from Gibson and other sites onto your smart phone and it is free!! So attempting to charge the kind of money for this product looks even more like a waste of money.",1
6921,"Does not fit on my gibson explorer with foam pads. Had to take one of them off to slide it under the strings properly. Fits my strat, jackson, and SG fine but only gives you about an inch of space to work with. They need longer screws, less padding, or both.",1
6922,"It's alright I guess.  The yoke is very wide.  A little too much for a Strat.  I had to bend the arms in a bit to get it to hold securely.  When I did this, it felt like they could crack in my hands at any time.  I am also a little confused why they have the hole spacing the way they do.  Studs are 1.5"" wide.  They always have been.  Sure would be nice if the mounting holes ran down the center line.  I understand you can use wall anchors into the drywall, but would you trust those to your vintage axe?  Me either.  That said, I wouldn't hang my '63 Fender from a $5 hanger either.  However, I would hang my $250 Squire by it.",1

6937,"I used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele.  It's attractive.  It's well made. It's fork is a tad large for the ukulele  It has rubber o-rings that slide, so I can bring them in and the uke does fit then.  But then, even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase (or wall, if you use it there).  The uke hits when I put it in the hanger, so I put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase.

Many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners.  This is much less expensive, holds very well, is even more low profile than this hanger, and never drops a uke. Consider it for your needs.

I'd not buy another of these for a ukulele.  It likely works fine for a guitar, though.

I deducted one point for the fact that, even though it's adjustable (the o-rings), and advertised for ukes, it doesn't work well for them.  And it's heavy and not stylish, in my opinion.  I have the Hercules wall hanger (mechanical gripper) for my electric guitars, and it's fabulous (for guitars; overkill for lightweight ukuleles, maybe).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules-Stands-Wallmount-Guitar-Hanger-GSP39WB/dp/B000EEJGRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules Stands Wallmount Guitar Hanger GSP39WB</a>

Update 9/7/11: the more I use it, the less I like it.  I find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all, and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune.  So, for small instruments (you'd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos), this is atrocious.  For guitars, it's not as good as Hercules.",1

6939,"Considering its relatively low cost I am quite happy with sound and key action of this piano. There is no function display, which I knew before I purchased it, but I didn't realize just what a pain in the butt this is. It would be impossible to memorize all of the button and key combinations for various setting changes unless you're a savant. Therefore, you need the chart handy at all times. $100 Casios have nice video displays so I don't think it would have caused a major price increase to add one and would have been well worth a few extra dollars. Also, the graded action is basically blocks of keys with a total of 3 degrees of heaviness. The lowest keys require too much force and on my particular piano B1 is defective and needs to be struck very hard to produce a sound. I considered returning it but decided against the hassle and accepted the defective B1 key. The non-piano voices are unimpressive. I basically wanted an 88 weighted key piano and that's what I got at a good price. I have a Hammond organ and Yamaha synth for other voices. If you want an inexpensive multipurpose keyboard, I recommend a Casio WK-245. Even though I have these other expensive keyboards I LOVE the 245 and still play it often. It was less than $200. If you just want an 88 key piano with decent weight and action at a low price then you will probably be happy with this one.",1

6946,"It's fairly decent, but didn't blow me away.  It seems like most reviews on Amazon or elsewhere online are written by people who got this for free.  I bought this pretty much blindly because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but now feel a bit duped.

The sound activated mode isn't too intelligent, the LED's will flash pretty inconsistently and not in sync with any type of noticeable bass or percussion noises.  This feature only really works well with one isolated sound, such as a hand clap, or one instrument playing.  I am in a band where we are completely DIY and have no budget for someone to control lights, and wanted to score something cheap that would at least look better than a normally lit stage.  I was hoping the sound activated mode would have been a little more intelligent...

My major complaint is the fact that with the sound activated mode, you only have two settings and both settings use ALL of the colors.  I would have given this product a 4 or 5 star if it was designed in such a way that you could simply turn the sound activation ""on"" or ""off"" on each color setting.  A lot of the color settings look cheesy to me and the style of music I perform... I would have loved to have this thing on sound activated mode with JUST the red lights, but unfortunately I cannot do that.

I also wish there was an on/off switch, but it's not a huge problem... I will probably have to secure the end of the power adapter to the unit so I can plug and unplug the device during my set.

Overall, I kind of wish I just saved my money towards a more elaborate light setup.  This would be fine for someone who just wants cool light effects for a party or event, but if you're a musician looking for a cheap solution to basic stage lighting without a light technician, just be aware of the points I bring up.",1

6954,"I have exclusively played Suzuki's since I was about 13. My first harp was the Promaster & I loved the weight & the sound.
Just last year I discovered the Valved Promaster which seems to project better sound giving you more room to bend the notes. One problem with valved Promasters is they all seemed to need to be broken in before you could get the full sound out of the harps.
The SUZUKI MANJI is the best ""play right out of the box harp"". You get the great sound & ability to bend notes like the valved promaster without the dead notes or having to break it in much. It does have one ""dead note"" Since I got it the 3 hole is a little tough to blow through.

Bottom line is I really like this harp but it's not perfect. I want to keep experimenting & maybe try some HOHNER/Lee Oscars...
If your looking for professional sound this is a great harp. If your not used to nice harmonicas you will be blown away & amazed at how good you can sound playing a nice one compared to a lower grade or toy-store harp.

6955,"I needed a stand and was attracted to this 1) because of the price and 2) because of the reviews.  I think the stand is ok but nothing to rave about.  I almost returned it because it just does not seem super stable to me.  My alto sax does fit but the setup has a bit of a wobbly feel to me even with all the screws firmly tightened.  The support arm slips into the middle socket and then there is a thumb screw at the base you use to tighten that arm inside the base.  Since my only intention with this is for a home stand where I will not be subjecting the sax to much toppling risk I decided to keep it rather than deal with returning it and then find a different stand.  If I was playing out and wanted a really safe stand I would probably do more research and find the most stable and protective stand out there.  For less than $13 including tax and free Prime shipping however, I will keep this.  It does get the job done but does not leave me with a feeling of complete security for my sax.  3 stars from me - ok but if something should happen to it I would look to upgrade to a higher stability model.",1
6956,This was purchased as a Father's Day present for my father as he has a nice koa wood guitar that the strap kept coming off of.  This strap stays on very well and does fit just about any of his guitars and his bass guitar.  The leather is very nice looking as well.  However the strap is very hot to use and does not allow slide along his shoulder while he plays to reposition his guitar.  This is a needed feature that you could probably get with one of the satin ones or the woven ones because his fingers are short and he plays a lot of barchords.  So it's going to be used with his bass.,1
6957,"Well, have never been able to tune it.  Kept it because my wife said my daughter won't know the difference and will love it forher birthday.  5 months later and it just sits there on a stand.  Maybe she's still too young (5) we'll see.  I'm going to try some new strings.",1
6958,"I needed another mix stand so I was on a budget. I bought this mic stand and it was well pack. But I have a heavy Mic and every time I attach the mic on it, the mic stand would tilt down or fall. So what I did is get a sand bag lol and it solve the issue. I gave it 3 stars because I felt the manufacture could have notice this problem before they mass produce this mic stand.",1
6959,two of the chanels didn't work  do i have to send it back to reapair??,1
6960,it works fine,1
6961,"I needed a quick, cheap & dirty DI box and got what I paid for.  Not to be confused with a Radial or Countryman, however.",1
6962,I did call the manufacturer for guidelines on fit as my guitar wasn't listed. I got great support but when the item arrived it was too thick which they didn't mention. A call back and they agreed it needed to be filed down. This is somewhat complicated to do properly for me with regular tools.  It wasn't expensive though and perhaps one day I'll take it to my Luthier when I need another setup.,1
6963,"I can see that these lights are very popular, but I think it's definitely for a specific demographic.  If you're older than 30 and you're not buying this for your kids this light is not going to do it for you unless you like the total nightclub vibe.  I found the rotating colored circles to be distracting and just kiddish in appearance.  Don't know how to explain it.

A few weeks after I bought this I went to a friend's apartment in New York City.  He had a rotating ball and single white focus beam light, both made by Chauvet as well I believe, at his party.  It looked so much better.  The lights  didn't move to the music, but it did create a nice atmosphere that fit whatever was playing, mellow or fast beat. Also, a rotating ball will send a pattern around the entire room - you don't get that with this model. I so wished I had bought the ball/single light instead.

Something like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chauvet-MBK-2-Mirror-Ball-Party-Kit/dp/B0002GYKFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chauvet MBK-2 Mirror Ball Party Kit</a>

I ended up giving my LX-10 to my 13 year old niece who absolutely loved it.  If you check other reviews for this kind of light you'll find that a lot of kids have liked using this light for their parties.  If that's who you're buying it for go for it.  If it's for someone over age 30 and wants to have an adult party . . . well, know your taste and that of your guests.  Didn't do it for me, it might for you.  You can find samples of this light's performance on youtube.",1
6964,ok,1

6966,"the product is okay  .. but I bought the ""used"" model from the warehouse to save some bucks.  Bad move  ... was missing parts. Not good to buy ""used"" anything that requires assembly because chances are high that some part(s) will be missing.  In my case,  8 assembly screws and a rubber bumper pad was missing form the open box.  I returned the item, but will take a loss on the return shipping since Amazon's return allowance is only half of the actual return postage.",1
6967,small,1
6968,"No assembly instructions came with this- really?!? -- so I tried it myself - and I am NOT good at this sort of thing. Only after I got it assembled did it occur to me to go on line, where indeed I found directions. Problem: I can't get it adjusted so that it doesn't flip over at the slightest touch, dumping my music on the floor. Not the whole stand, just the part that holds the music.  Maybe if I had a ratchet, whatever that is? I do have a set of wrenches, but it's not possible to tighten the nuts that might hold the stand steady. I've also had to tighten the base once in the month or so that I've had this. Overall -- disappointing.

Update:  I took the stand into my local music store, where -- though I hadn't bought it there -- they kindly fixed the problem for me, using a tool that I didn't own. So now it's perfectly stable, and I'm upgrading to three stars -- not five because they really should include a page of instructions.",1
6969,Needs improvements. Not as flawless as the Snark.,1
6970,"I compared a lot of analog delays before buying one of these.  I picked it based on the relatively-long delay time, reviews, and price.  The modulation you can add to repeats seems like a nice feature but you can only change the depth of it, making it a novelty at best.  I almost always had it turned all the way down.  As for the delay itself, it just always seemed so artificial, to the point of sounding out of place and distracting.  I ended up replacing the Memory Boy with another analog delay.  It only has 330ms of repeat time, instead of 550, but sounds so much better.  I would avoid the Memory Boy.",1
6971,"It's not bad. It would be better if I bought one large enough for my finger. Still, I'd rather stick with a Copper slide.",1

6975,I was a bit let down when I received this drum machine and I heard the percussion sounds for the first time. I'm not really upset because it does have a lot of good features that I can utilize in my home recording studio however the sound of this machine just does not come close to the sound of my Alesis SR-16. I think this machine is simply much older than I thought it to be. It is easy to program and very user friendly but it just does not have the sound quality I was hoping for.,1
6976,"The windway of this instrument is quite narrow.  So, saliva from your mouth will always clog it.  Moreover, the breath pressure you should apply to this instrument is so marginal, so low that at begining you won't be able to produce nice sound on this recorder.  Maybe try plastic Aulos, the ones I tried don't have clogging problems and they are more tolerable of regular breath pressure.  Better yet buy yourserf wooden Moeck recorder.",1
6977,"I have been using these things for some time now and they have generally lasted about two month @ minimum.

But this last batch of 12 only last about five weeks at best before they are as hard as rocks - and I'm placing them in cases that have been humidified - just replacing the packets.

The packets from the three packs seem to last much longer - maybe I just got a bad batch.",1
6978,"D'Addario strings are the best! I use them on multiple guitars including Strats, Tele's and Les Paul's, but I'm afraid this set is just too danged heavy for my tastes. I threw a set of these on a Baja Telecaster that I was re-building including a Bigsby vibrato, so I thought a heavier gauge string might just work-out well, but as others have noted, the string tension on these (once tuned to pitch) is rather ""stout"", and I just couldn't seem to bond with them. They bowed the neck a bit, which I readily resolved with the truss rod, but they sounded rather dull and flat to my ears, nothing like what a Telecaster should sound like. So I've gone back to a lighter gauge (11-49) set (D'Addario EXL-115's), and much of my brighter, classic Country 'twang' is back! Yahoo!",1
6979,they look cool but flex too much to be useful,1

6991,"ehhh  I bought them to try on my Martin DC-16RGTE and didn't like them.  I'll to stick to the  ""DR Rare"" strings.. The sound amazing and last a long time.",1
6992,"The main reason to get this is because it's portable and can be run off batteries.  Although the aux input is a nice feature.  And the tuner would be nice if it were more accurate.

The sound is not great but ok.  I'd describe it somewhere between a Pignose and a regular practice amp.  But if you just want something to take to the beach or camping where ok sound will suffice then this might be for you.

Edit 9/6/13: After months of trying to get a decent sound (even using the FUSE software), I finally gave up and replaced it with a Roland Microcube which is $30 more but the sound quality is much, much better.  I'm disappointed because my practice amp is a Fender and was hoping for the similar sound in a portable package but it's nowhere close.

My advice is to do yourself a favor and try the Roland first.",1
6993,"I find this unit adequate, I use it with my MacBook as part of a portable 'winter' studio. I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).",1
6994,"Pros: it works and the sound is acceptable.

Cons: Produces noticeable 60Hz buzz when used with power adapter and passive pickup. When on battery power, the unit works only in transparent mode, the on/off switch does not work, neither do any sound controls.",1

6996,"Good enough for my needs, I'm happy with these strings.",1

6998,These work fine but there is room for improvement.  A larger diameter hole to fit various brands of cymbal stands and maybe include rubber grommets to reduce metal on metal contact and noise with the stand.  Still better than buying regular flat washers from a hardware store.  I may modify these myself to address my previously mentioned issues.,1
6999,"It barely gets the job done. People are saying it works well for the Yeti. It doesn't really work that well. The Yeti microphone is much heavier than I expected and this stand can not hold it up very well. Hanging the microphone upside down is definitely not going to happen. I didn't expect much from this stand since it's an inexpensive stand and NEEWER (no offense), but I trusted the reviews and tried to save a bit of money and was a bit disappointed. If you're using a Yeti or something of close weight, go for a more quality product designed to hold up something of that weight well. If you try to add the Radius II shockmount, you can definitely forget about hanging it upside down unless it's from somewhere high. It lifts to mouth level when right side up. If I had the money I'd look for something else. You get what you pay for.",1

7009,"Gigging in a small club can be a lot like wilderness camping. You carry everything you need in  and you take it all with you when you leave. For this reason, the idea of a small, versatile, light-weight yet well cushioned and sturdy guitar and ukulele stand is something I have been keeping my eye out for. And here it is! The CR-15 from Crescendo.

I have a relationship with my instruments and each matters a lo0t to me. I decided to take a chance and use this stand, right out of the box, with two of my top-line instruments: a Taylor 856CE (12-string guitar) and a KALA SMHTE-C tenor ukulele.

Historically, I have carried in rather large, solid wood stands that are rather large and cumbersome to vary. They were actually designed and built to display instruments than to hold them safely on stage. I have always refused to use cheap (OR expensive) large, heavy and awkward metal stands. With a tad of trepidation, I entrusted the uke and the nearly $4,000. Taylor to its care while I played the other. Now, I am converted.

This CR-85 weighs less than one pound and folds small enough to fit back into the box it came in (10  X 3/2 X 3  in.) It expands easily to the necessary proportions for your instrument and collapses easily as well  but not TOO easily!

The attached photos illustrate each instrument in the stand. No shakes, no slips, no tragedies.  The rubber cushions on the bottom hold the bouts securely and gently as does the cushioning atop the upper rear of the stand.

Solidly build, versatile and light-weight professional-quality gear is always needed. Thanks, Crescendo, for this necessary accessory!",2
7010,"Poor instructions, but unit is pretty cool.",2
7011,I love these straps. I have one for every of my ukuleles. Perfect. Great price and perfectly functional and unobtrusive.,2
7012,"I just received my order of this little beast, I'm amazed by the sound of this it doesn't sound digital. I highly recommend this to those whose on a budget or those who don't want to carry heavy multi effects pedals, the tones is true and the price won't burn your pocket.",2
7013,Very nice.,2
7014,"Good build quality, excellent portability.",2
7015,"All my guitars have strap locks -- some Dunlop, some Schaller -- so I have lots of real-world experience with both. Never has one failed me yet. But I have had one or more adrenaline moments with Dunlop when I though the lock was fully engaged but it wasn't. That's why I am using Schaller from now on. They cradle the strap post so even if the lock pin comes loose the weight of the guitar hanging on the strap keeps the strap engaged. Kind of like a built in fail-safe. In my opinion this makes it the better choice.",2
7016,Works as advertised,2
7017,Frostbyte nylon is much more flexible than regular. This .66 gives more than a .50 it's really a piece of work for playing some slow blues. Tom Petty Free Falling love it this one and EVH are 2 of my favs,2
7018,"I order reeds from amazon all the time.  I am trying to recruit some bassoon players so a bought these, one for me to demonstrate and one for a student to learn on.  I can't speak to the fine points of bassoon reeds but these were cheap and played very easily.  5 star for beginners and value.",2
7019,"These are pretty good for a $5 set of strings.  They're fairly crisp and bright, albeit lacking a bit of low end punch.  They play fast and are ideal for lead guitar where a bright tone is needed to cut through the mix.

7022,"Just because it is too early for me to fully endorse this product. However, the initial impression is very positive and despite the comments of the unit not providing isolated power, I cannot say that is does not and this power supply gave me what I needed without noise and interference. It is small enough to easily fit in the accessory case but also providing enough outlets to power quite a few pedals or other accessories. I also like that Donner is using environment friendly packaging to ship these units.",2
7023,"These Joyo pedals never cease to amaze me. The range of tones from this thing is incredible! And the boost, man, it's insane!!! I absolutely love it! When looking at pedals, joyo is always my first choice!",2
7024,"This is a great set of drum mutes. I've tried making my own and had some early Evans brand ones. This particular product really gets it all right. The feel is better than you would expect. The ride cymbal mute makes it sound a little like a wooden block and makes a ""click"" sound. The bass drum mute is great at reproducing the low tone and the snare mute is the stand out best. Would recommend to any drummer looking to drastically reduce their playing volume.",2
7025,awesome Mic stand with boom bar the price Is more than fair I'll buy from this seller always,2
7026,Between these two you can tell if your neck is straight and if a fret is high. I wish the straight edge didn't include the space between the nut and first fret as the neck is sometimes elevated in this region.,2

 Really nice conpression and amazing eternal sustain.... It makes any fuzz or distortion just pop out of your amp... But in a smooth way... Love it!",2
7028,"I wanted something light and compact that can hold a few items, but also fit well in a carry-on and protect the jamstik indoors or out. This case is the perfect solution, and has a nice, adjustable strap as well. Good  durable construction and love having the jamstik label to show it off!",2
7029,These are the best celluloid shell-colored thin picks around.  Tried all the off brands but came back to Fender picks in the end.,2

7032,Great unit.,2
7033,"This instrument works great, but beware; it's very loud. So, if you're looking for a guiro that needs to work with a small ensemble without a lot of brass or electric guitars, you probably want to buy a smaller, wooden type. If you want the sound to cut through good-sized Latin orchestra, this is your best bet.",2
7034,Great pad and feels drum like.,2
7035,Bought as a gift.  well packed and quality materials used for its construction.,2

7037,"Cordless mics don't work well at all
Plays plugged in music loudly and plugged in mics work very well with it",2
7038,"The RC booster is a well built, roadworthy multi-purpose tool. It's good for overdriving an amp (or another pedal), adding or cutting bass and treble and of course giving you a super clean volume boost to jump out of the mix. Best of all though, it really does not have it's own sound, except a subtle fattening of tone as you turn up the gain knob. The treble and bass controls can really help fix tone problems with amps or other pedals. Yes, it is pricey for a boost pedal, but this one is worth it. I used to have a TC spark booster, but it gave the treble a glassy, sightly artificial ""overcooked"" sound. The RC Booster definitely solved that problem.",2
7039,sounds great and looks pretty.  keeps in tune fairly well.,2
7040,"Some of the reviews may make you thinks that these are great replacement cables of high durability.  I set up at different venues about 30 times a year.  Cables get run over and pulled stupid just because of the frequency of what I do.  These cables feel somewhat cheap, but they are going to work.  Normally would give them 3 starts, but the value of these is amazing, so it earns another star.,  These are better than your average throw away xlr cables, but certainly not in the same league as Hosa, Peavey, etc.",2

Mine didn't come with the SD card with a pre-loaded demo as was advertised on the box.  However Amazon rectified the situation and I'm pleased with the service and product. I definitely recommend it.",2
7045,"I built a custom cab for this speaker an am driving it with an egnator tweaker 15.  I was looking for a speaker for blues and classic rock.  I also wanted something that would be a little more unique.  After I waited to review the speaker until it had a long break-in.  As the speaker has been broken in, it has sounded better and better.

 It has very good bottom end without sounding too loose.  It definately has a ""bigger"" sound then the stock celestion speaker.  This speaker definately shines while playing clean, or with a little grit.  I personally do not like the high gain tone of this speaker, but that isn't what it was made for.

Overall, this is a great speaker that has greatly improved my blues tone.

  If you found this review helpful, please click helpful below.",2
7046,"This pedal isn't perfect but I'm giving it 5 stars because of how great Donner's customer service is. 6 months after I bought this pedal, with minimal use, something went wrong w/ the pedal and it would playback heavily distorted and 5x louder than it should be (sounds cool, but definitely not how it's supposed to)... contacted Donner and they're sending a replacement SIX MONTHS LATER. That's really cool of them.

The pedal itself (before it messed up) worked exactly how you'd expect it to. I wish stopping the loops was a little simpler... you double tap to stop it and then double tap and hold to erase (but that also will play your loop for a second so it can feel kind of awkward.) If you were trying to use this while playing guitar and singing, I think it'd be hard to not get tripped up a little when you stop the loop because of the double tap. But if you're just playing I think you'll be fine.

Because of how risk free it seems w/ Donner being so great, I recommend picking it up. It's a great pedal to learn if looping is something you're actually interested in. You could always buy another pedal later with an easier workflow, but even then I think you could still find uses for this.",2
7047,"Affordable and reliable patch cables.  Mogami branding is a plus, but to be honest I couldn't hear a difference between these and the planet waves patch cables I was already using. The pancake connectors are sturdy and will work great if you have a permanent pedalboard setup that needs to save space.",2
7048,"I like this pedal very much so far. My favorite pedal was a Joyo and it didn't last long. It's in my junk pile. I hate the for the money thing. This delay pedal does a lot more than most one trick ponys out there. Money when you get into Chinese stuff is a gamble, I hope I get some time out of this Joyo because it just that great.",2
7049,Been playing special 20's for 25 years. Still the best.,2
7050,"So many different things you can do with this pedal! Many of which no other delay pedal offers such as the warp, dual, twist, and modulate modes. This is a very very simple pedal, too. Something this awesome I figured would be complicated but I didn't even have to read the manual before knowing this piece of work inside and out SO DON'T LET ITS APPEARANCE FOOL YOU. It's simple and amazing- simply amazing! ",2

7055,"Even though I have a tuner in my pedalboard setup, and one on my iMac via MainStage 3, the Snark is indispensable. It's perfect for those times when you don't want to drag out a bunch of gear, and just want to noodle around, even without an amp. I use this little guy for electric guitars, and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars, as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag.",2

I'm currently using it primarily as a banjo mic which has been instructional on how different the sounds are that come from various areas of a banjo head (because of how directional the mic is) or guitar top.  It helps having unidirectional mics for recording separate tracks simultaneously in the same room (like guitar and vocal) so I'll probably get at least one more.",2

7068,"I love the Korg tuners and the one I got with my lever harp is a real whiz at getting the harp tuned to concert pitch. The only problem is that if you use the built in microphone, high back ground noise levels can really make tuning a problem. To get around this, I bought one of the old style cords that was basically a small microphone shrink tubed onto an alligator clip. On the harp, this meant that I had to clip onto one of the bridge pins to tune the harp without marring a $3,000 instrument.

These new clips are just as accurate, have a wider opening range and are plastic. Unlike my old cord they will not mar the wood or polished surfaces on a harp, guitar, violin, sax, clarinet, etc. I am using my old cord, with the alligator clip, on a dreadnought guitar by clipping the pickup to the high E bridge pin. It fits easily inside the groove on the head of the pin and does no noticeable marring to the instrument. I have never had a bridge pin fail on me, but I have lost a few so I keep a few spares around in my cases. If one gets to chewed up by the old clip, no big loss. I have also found that tuning from the bridge gives the most accurate tuning, although, attaching to the sound hole or neck head seems to work pretty darned good as well.

When teamed up with the KORG CA-40 tuners, one of the best bangs for the buck in chromatic tuners going right now.

This is a big step up from the old cords, and having a tuner with each of my guitars and my harp. I have compared the variation, using the same tuner and all three cords and all three tuners and not found much, if any deviation between cords and tuners. Not the best you can get, but you will have to spend a LOT more money to get anything that's marginally better.",2

7070,"I bought this pedal after purchasing a Casio keyboard that came with it's own small foot pedal, which was inadequate for my purposes.  I tried to use my Yamaha foot pedals (I have more than one) and they wouldn't work at all.  When I connected the Casio pedal it worked perfectly.",2
7071,"It's a poorly-kept secret that the key to metal distortion tones is found in tweaking the midranges.  When it comes building a good metal distortion pedal, however, the Joyo Pocket Metal proves that, sometimes, less is more.  There is a crowded field of competent metal pedals out there, including the venerable Boss Metal Zone and MXR Fullbore Metal.  But while the assortment of midrange knobs on those pedals theoretically makes the ""perfect tone"" possible, it also leaves you constantly bumping and tweaking with knobs, which always seem ""just a bit off"".

Fortunately, the Joyo Pocket Metal is a pedal that rocks as soon as you plug it in.  There is no tone control for bass/treble - this has been replaced by a single ""Mid"" control.  Still, you get quite a bit of versatility ranging from scooped (muffled, thumpy) mids, to boosted (punchy, clear) mids.

The Pocket Metal has gotten considerably less hype than many of its excellent Joyo counterparts, but I think it deserves more praise.  Having been recently disappointed by the low output of the Joyo Hot Plexi, I was pleased to find that the Pocket Metal is plenty loud.  You also won't miss having an independent bass control - it has plenty of low end.  Actually, the Mid knob can do quite a bit to emphasize or de-emphasize the ""thump"" effect of the low end, as well.

I also was quite happy with how the pedal responds to higher notes and lead guitar playing.  While it isn't quite as melodic as many high-gain overdrive pedals, the individual notes are well defined and can sustain quite a bit with the ""Dist"" knob turned up.  Also, while the pedal produces some noise, it's quieter than I expected it to be given the level of gain.

The build quality is what is - probably better suited for home players and recording than a live setting.  But at this price point, you get no compromise in tone quality or simplicity.  I'm not a huge metal player, but this just became my go-to pedal for all things metal.",2

7102,"Seriously great! It did take about an hour or so to get the setup right or very close to right from the box, but once the intonation was set and the pickups were dialed in, I started having a great time.

Without the pickups tapped, it has a pretty rich sound in the bridge and binary positions, but the neck pickup is a tad bit muddy. This should be an easy fix for a tech or a luthier, but certainly isn't a deal-breaker. When tapped, the possibilities of tones open up better than I could have hoped for.

The finish of the guitar is a little boring and I suspect it will become a dent and blemish magnet despite my best efforts to save it. Regardless, Gibson QC did their job and made sure that this thing was tight.

What's absolutely mind-blowing about this is that I bought it as a ""used"" item through the Amazon warehouse. It couldn't have been more perfect. Not a single scratch or blemish on the guitar at all. I paid nearly half of the going rate for a fantastic guitar. Even at the retail price of $800-something, this is one of those deals that is too good to pass up.

I was pretty exhaustive in my search for another HB guitar and probably played every Les Paul, SG, and PRS in my area and have absolutely zero reservations with my purchase. At retail price point, there is simply too much versatility and value in this guitar to not gloat over what I spent and what I saved. I would have easily had to venture into the $2k+ territory to find something that was remarkably better. For the extra money, I could do a ton more -- which I plan to do.

7110,"I was curious as to how the Chord Buddy would work. Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).
I can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.
I do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing.

The pedal was supplied by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair review.

My first impression of the pedal was good. The pedal is made of metal, and has a really solid feel. It's smaller than my other pedals, due to the fact that it doesn't have a battery. In order to use the pedal you will need a power supply that is properly set up for 9 volt devices. Donner sells one for a reasonable price, if you don't already have one. I originally tried to use the power supply from a different device and found that it was really noisy. As soon as I got the proper supply it worked perfectly.

When evaluating a chorus, it's important to remember that it's not like other effects, such as a wah-wah pedal. Chorus is much more subtle than most effects, and is typically more about filling in the sonic space with a wider sound than it is about making itself known in the mix. You might use it, for example, with an acoustic guitar to create a more full sound, or with a rhythm guitar to widen and soften the sound on mellow songs. Like any other musical gizmo, though, it's up to you to figure out how to use it for best effect.

The controls are simple. There are three knobs and a stomp switch. The Level knob mixes the signal with the effect and the dry signal so that you can change the relative amount of the effect. Turning it to the left removes the wet signal (the effect), while turning it to the right increases the relative amount of the wet signal. The Depth switch basically controls the volume of the wet signal. Turning it to the right increases the depth and turning it to the left decreases it. Although everyone has their own musical vision, I tend to turn up the level and the depth to make the effect a little more intense. Finally, the Rate switch changes the rate at which the chorus oscillates (for lack of a better description). When it's turned to the left it slows down the timing of the effect, while turning it right speeds it up. When the Rate is turned all the way up you get a sort of tremolo-like sound, with a spacey ""blurred"" edge to the notes. The accompanying video will probably make the above descriptions a bit more clear.

Overall, I think that the Tutti Love chorus pedal is a good value. It's well-built, inexpensive, and it does what I'd expect a chorus to do. I did ding it one star, due to the lack of a battery option, but that is as much a matter of personal taste as anything else. If you already have a power supply for your pedals, or if you are aware that you will need one, it's really not going to be much of a problem.",2

7138,"Ive owned this and the older two-12"" model for over five years now. Theyve been used almost daily for lessons, plus countless gigs, big and small.  I can help you get the most from this versatile club amp.

First of all, the modeling: It's pretty good! The only tricky issue is Fender intentionally mis-labels some amp models to perpetuate the myth of their most famous amps. They call the good British sounds tweed, champ or blackface, while the British labeled amps are actually just stuper-gain versions of mondo metal madness. So, for reasonable adult players that means; use the models with Fender brand associations. You'll get better tone and distortions that don't suck.

Dont worry! There are plenty of stupid sounds in here if you are a case of arrested development with little talent or taste. And of course, you can always add the latest pedal from your ridiculously large collection for special effects. Practical minded old pros tend to carry less and do more. Either way, this amp has you covered.

Effects: These have a good musical assortment of usable effects, plus some cheesy gimmick combinations in factory memory. Fender is obviously trying to tempt young players by including ridiculous radical effect combinations. Best practice is to avoid or overwrite them with usable patches.

Tweaking: Super easy and intuitive! The manual is blessedly short and written in comprehensible English. Good Job Fender! But you don't need the manual. Adjusting any effect is so easy even an old anti-tech guy like me can do it without any training. How?

You just select the model-effect-tone-gain-volumeetc. you want. The red light flashes. If you're happy with the tweak, press the red button and hold. It automatically saves that sound in memory at the current location. Double-press any knob to instantly get to deep editing. You don't need a computer or your stupid smart phone. Yes, it will interface with your computer if that is what you want. Fender includes free software for such defective lonely humanoids.

The cool thing is, so long as you do NOT press the flashing red SAVE button, you can always get back to square one.

That feature is GREAT for several reasons, not the least of which is when you must play host at jam sessions. Since all knobs operate in real time, you can allow any goofy guest guitarist to play through your amp with impunity. He can adjust the knobs until he finds that perfect setting to massage his insecure ego while you go drink and contemplate your bad career choices.

After the band leader kicks him off stage, you can instantly return your amp to real-world musicality by simply turning the amp selector knob either direction (one click) then back again. Since the Stevie Ray wanna-be did not save his awful tones, your settings remain unsullied by his rank incompetence. That makes your interminable sentence in jam-session purgatory far more tolerable!

Also valuable is the MASTER VOLUME. It really works! Once you have your favorite sounds loaded into memory, and your relative volumes established, they ALL respond equally to the global master volume. Unlike master volumes on tube amps which change tone or response curves, modeling amps like this have a simple knob that controls overall volume.

An unspoken but VERY useful addition to the higher end Mustangs is, STEREO OUTPUTS.

Of course its impossible to get true stereo effects from a single speaker. But these amps have TWO BALANCED LINE OUTS !!! (Please read that last sentence again so the import of it sinks firmly into your skull)

That means for a BIG GIG, you don't need a new rig! You just send these stereo outs to the house PA! Theyre BALANCED (three-pin XLR) so you can run 300 feet of cable if you have to without adding noise or losing high-frequencies. PLAY IN STEREO just once, REALLY LOUD. Suddenly youll realize why the Great Mahooga gave you two ears.

If you're a fledgling rocker who has not yet experienced stereophonic glory, you're in for a revelation! All pros have stereo effects whether they know it or not. Pro recordings are all stereo. All the best modern live PA systems are stereo and they use stereo psychoacoustic effects, even on mono instruments.

Chorus, Phase, and Detuned pitch-shifting are ALL ten times more effective in stereo. With this amp and a pair of powered speakers, you can rule the universe with righteous stereo effects befitting of your rock-god stature! Or just make your nascent noodling more tolerable. I use EON powered speakers for that purpose. Ive also use QSC and Mackie. They all work.

The cons are few and small with this amp.

ONE: It is heavier than it needs to be since it was designed and commissioned before Fender got smart and started using Baltic Birch cabs.

Since the line is successful, they don't want to change it. If you are handy like us old guys, you might have access to a shop full of woodworking tools. So if your back is bothering you, you could build your own cab to house this head and a neodymium speaker. I did that and lost twenty-two pounds from the two-12 model!

For the smaller one (like this) I elected to simply attach it to a cheap fold up dolly. Thats easy enough and requires no engineering or woodworking skill. You could also just add wheels, but I find the dolly is more comfortable and convenient, especially on small combo amps like this.

TWO: NOISE.
Since the modeling and effects are all done with inexpensive chips, these have a noticeable amount of self-noise and digital artifacts. Those noises and artifacts are compounded every time you add effects or use more complex amp models. I hear them because I know what to listen for and curiously, my hearing is still intact after decades of LOUD RAWK. But even then, these noises are only bothersome in quiet settings, like my studio, alone, at night.

In live settings, that noise is imperceptible. The crash-boom-bang of any rock drummer plus the constant din of loudmouth patriotic Americans in bars masks these unpleasant artifacts. If you can still hear that noise at the jazz dinner gig, have another martini. Relax. It will all be over soon.

ONE GREAT TIP: Use the preamp of your choice BEFORE the input! I have had great success with various Sans-amp pedals, the PSA-1, and my beloved Carl Martin plexi-drive. All of them work. By using YOUR preamp instead of an internal model, you free up processing bandwidth on those cheap chips to do other things better. There is less overall noise and you won't hear strange hiccups on the ducking-delay or chirps in your reverbs. Plus that means your tone is all analog up-front where it counts.

Compression: This has a decent if unremarkable compressor. To use it, you must choose it instead of another pedal effect. If compression is important to you AND you're lazy, thats the option to take. But as stated, this has an effects loop, so you can always add the compressor of choice post-pre or before your analog preamp. (My favorite analog compressor? Carl Martin four knob)

There are at least TWO internal compressors in the mustangs. One is a single knob affair which is dirt simple. Even nascar fans can use it.

The other one I use has adjustments for normal compression parameters: attack, level, ratio, release. I have never edited the internal compression with a computer, but I was told by the zit covered kid who sold it to me, that you can also edit the knee of this compressor. That may be interesting to someone whos complexion has not yet cleared.

Again, using good analog tools up-front frees up processing power so you can use the decent internal effects for reverb, echo, tremolo, flanging, or delicious STEREO chorus.

It all depends on the gig Im lazy, grumpy, old and jaded. So for most gigs, I carry ONLY the amp and a single guitar. When I do sessions or BIG GIGS where I know there will be a good stereo PA, I bring at least those two extra boxes to establish good tone up front. (compressor and preamp) Then the amp does all the other heavy lifting without ponderous pedalboard preparations.

In a live setting in front of a few thousand inebriated water-bags, the difference between my lexicon reverbs and these internal reverbs is unnoticeable. In sessions, studios have their own verbs and fancy psychoacoustic gizmos, therefore you don't need them then either.

So, other than the slight noise and digital artifacts, plus the weight, this is one of the BEST BARGAINS for ANY PRO player. It has every effect and copy-cat tone youll ever need for any famous cover tune. Plus, it won't break your bank or your back. Use my tips to get the most from this thing. Youll be able to use it on just about any gig.

Also, if your $hit gets waylaid by some incompetent airline on a fly date, you can always buy a replacement at a local store in any big city, then return it the next day. (I know, thats terrible, but neither SIR or LEEDS had one to rent. I only did that once! )

Fender did several important things VERY RIGHT with the Mustang series, and this 1x12 model is the most versatile of the bunch.

Use it as is for small gigs, practice and teaching.

For other gigs, add on a good preamp and-or a compressor to make its internal effects better and give you more effect choices.

Small quiet venues don't benefit as much from stereo, but when you must play a session AND a big live gig on one day, this is a great choice!

Ive found those talentless control-freaks called sound engineers are less intimidated when they see a small combo amp on a giant stage. That makes them less likely to impose their pussy-willow taste upon your rock god tone. When they find you have TWO balanced line outs, that makes them happy too. They don't have to scrounge two crappy DIs from the bottom of their boxes.

Real world Reliability: I should point out that I am most definitely NOT a Fender fanatic. I ONLY played Marshall and HiWatts for three decades. Nor was I even a Fender amp fan, UNTILL I started using their cheap amps fifteen years ago. Since then, I have used and abused their rumble bass amps beyond any ethical standard. All of them have survived the most heinous torture at outdoor rock gigs, traveling in frozen vans and sweltering hot cars, being knocked over by drunken drummers. Not once have they ever let me down.

I had ONLY ONE problem with the first 2x12 mustang. It quit on me during the first set of my first gig with it. It was fixed fast and free under warranty and has worked perfectly for eight years since. Fender warranty pays for EVERYTHING, including labor, parts and shipping those parts to your local repair center. FIVE years. Covers everything!  except maybe your Jimi Hendrix impression with lighter fluid.

Highly recommended. Get one or two. Be happy. Save money. Practice more. Get your diploma.
Brush your teeth and eat right. Turn off that damn phone and look around. Read books.",2
7139,Awesome gibson knobs great looking for any GIBSON,2
7140,"I call this ""My Hawaiian Ukulele"" I stored it after I failed, learning to play. When I had to move four hours away, to care for a sick senior. I grabbed it on the way out the door. I was worried about the strings, tuning and how well it held up, over time. I purchased an app that heard me play. Even with the old strings, I improving, even earning points enough to move to the next lesson. I actually sound like I'm playing. I think I stretched my old strings, since now when I check it, it stays in tune. My new strings are still in the package. This instruments is worth the money and your time to learn. It's a beautiful solid made instrument. Im sure the quality of my Ukulele has more to do with it, then my talent.",2
7141,This was an added gift to go with the SML-385 Karaoke System....and it is perfect.  Got plenty of use by all the children....good sound and perfect as the back up microphone.,2
7142,I changed my string gauges on a new guitar so I use 9's instead of 10's for the E string,2
7143,What to say? It's Yamaha brand!!! Amazing you can buy with eyes closed. Very good.,2
7144,"Its a nice pice,, easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar,,, the only matter and its not a big deal,, is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect",2
7145,"great guitar mat.  Probably paying extra for the fender name, because material wise it cost about 8 bucks.  Comes in convenient clear storage tube...additional storage for nuts, bolts, string winders, picks, etc.. in the bottom of the neck rest. great buy!!!",2
7146,"I spent weeks looking at accoustic electric guitar packages and determined this was a good value compared to the others. I was first impressed that Epiphone is a Gibson company, one of the giants of the industry. Having been a musician for many years I have grown to trust Gibson as a quality producer of good guitars. After the box arrived I pulled the guitar out and began to tune it with the tuner that is included. I spent the next two weeks practicing single note runs and holding cords when I decided to put the tuner on again and only one string out of tune after about 20 hours of play. As anyone who has learned the instrument can attest beginners are VERY hard on guitars and they are hard to keep tuned. The sound is quality for the price. The most notable problem I have seen with the competition is that strings buzz. I have not has this problem, even having tried to get that to happen. The construction is just as good. A complaint against the competition has been that you can see dried glue around the neck and body. Mine is pristine, not a spot of glue. You will never mistake this for a hand made Martin but I WOULD CONSIDER THIS TOP OF THE LINE IN IT'S CATEGORY.",2
7147,Awesome quality.,2
7148,Still trying to get comfortable using these. Eventually they should be okay for me. Have only been playing for a couple of months now.,2
7149,"I spend a lot of my day playing the ukulele, and I generally play with other people, so I get the chance to ""test-drive"" a wide variety of ukuleles in every price category and this is by far the best sounding, and easiest playing uke I've ever played at the entry level price-point (anything under $125 is considered to be entry level.)  This little Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is punching way above it's class... and it's totally scoring!  It looks nice with a satin finished mahogany laminate top, sides, and back, and solid mahogany neck, and it plays and sounds much better than anything I've played in this price range.  I review a lot of products, so I tend to be a bit of a task master in terms of what I expect from the products I review, and this one really met the challenge.  And while I wouldn't want to trade this for my daily driver (a Pepe Romero Grand Tenor), it is perfect as an extra for when folks stop by without their ukes and then end up needing one (it happens more often than you would believe!) or as an ukulele to take to the beach.  I think the video shows off it's strengths pretty well, but ultimately, it comes down to how it sounds, so I used my Rde NT4 into a Zoom H4n to record the audio on this video.

7151,"I bought this to put on the pedal board for my bass. I play 5 string, and wanted to have a pedal that would properly register the B string, even if I choose to detune it. And the bottom line is, this pedal does it. I don't get any noise when switching the tuner on and off, the pedal was easy to set up for display mode - it does everything I want it to, the way I want it to. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is it's not the fastest reacting tuner. It takes a moment to pick up and show you what you have on the display. Other than that, there's nothing to knock this pedal for.",2
7152,"I installed these on a Silvertone SD10, which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar.  They are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory.  If you are looking for a regular/medium string, these are real nice. Great product.",2
7153,"Look good.  On all 4 there is a 1-2 mm area that looks chipped but isn't which makes me think it's part of the manufacturing process.  They feel good.  I'm worried I'll break the pot trying to pull these off if I ever need to, so what I'll probably do instead is crush them with pliers.",2
7154,"Does what it says, very reliable. Only caveat: not adjustable.",2
7155,"My daughter bought this guitar in the toy section of a big box store.  I know nothing about guitars; but aside from being very lightweight, this guitar looks like a real guitar.  I was able to tune it because I did once play the violin.  That was easy enough, but it doesn't stay tuned for long.

The guitar doesn't come with any instructions save for some cards that showed finger placement for a few chords.  I didn't expect a full lesson book, but it would have been nice if it included a little something.

My daughter wants to take guitar lessons.  I have a feeling her toy won't be adequate but it's a start.  For kids who just want to play around, this guitar is just fine.",2
7156,"I'm not going to gush over this one...it simply works well for the price paid. It has nice thick leather ends that hold onto my guitar well enough(especially if you use locking clips...you DO use them, right? ;)). I like it and will use it again.",2

Compared to my PC's built-in webcam mic it's night and day. But what surprised me the most was how it smooth the recording was even in a room with screaming kids. It instinctively focused on the sounds in close proximity of the mic while filtering out background noise, breathing, or desk vibrations. I compared it to the audio from my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoom-ZH1-Handy-Portable-Digital-Recorder/dp/B003QKBVYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoom ZH1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder</a>&nbsp;(see video) and while they both added fullness to my voice the Zoom's auto-gain sometimes went too hot and it picked up all of the background sounds (which may be useful if you're recording the background).

The design is also very attractive however despite all the chrome and metallic finish it is mostly plastic other than the weighted base. I don't see any problems with this since all the plastic is very strong and well made and it probably keeps the weight and price down, but it's worth mentioning. I have a couple of friends with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver-Edition/dp/B002VA464S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone - Silver Edition</a>, and while it seems more versatile with it's multiple pick-up patterns, for single person recording I would choose the Nessie every time for it's drop dead simple capability to create clean audio. The mute button is touch sensitive and not a physical button, which is nice so that it won't pick up a click sound when you press/depress it. The headphone monitoring works well, but I found the output volume knob required a little bit more force than I would've liked, but since I don't adjust it during recording it doesn't cause any problems.

PROS:
+ Shock mount built-in
+ Pop filter built-in
+ 3 Modes Voice, Music, and Raw.
+ Pleasant LED ring indicates on (solid) and mute (flashing) modes

CONS:
- No recording software included or recommended for novices.
- Headphone volume requires two hands (one to anchor the mic) to operate.",2
7158,I just ordered yesterday so I haven't recieved the strings yet. But I use them on all of my instruments. It's wild what a nice set of strings can do even 4 a cheap instrument. I have a set on my 20$ Mahalo & it sounds almost as good as my expensive uk. Definately a great product love it.,2
7159,The string matched perfectly my spirit bass. Sound is good. The strings feel great and not too bright as i was expectind,2
7160,"No problems sound great with Jazz, use this guitar every day smooth easy to play no rusting, you would love the clean sound you get with these strings.",2
7161,"I put these on one of my Gibson Les Pauls' and so far so good.  Great sound and no wear after one session, unlike the D'Addario strings.
I will update in a few weeks as I see how long they last.",2
7162,No noise or hum - ran two of these from electronic drum module to mixer for stereo input. Quiet and good quality cable.,2
7163,awsome always great stuff from these guys thanks chuck,2
7164,"While it is just a stand, it seems to be sturdy and durable. Nothing special about it, but also no negatives that I can find either, than the fact that it doesn't give my foot massages. XD",2
7165,"These picks arrived fast for standard shipping. Three days! I bought this combo pack to see if there was any real difference between the derlin, nylon, and gel picks. I am here to tell you there is no difference in speed or feel to the pick. Now, they do sound a little different though. The derlin picks sound really good for hard rock power chords. The nylons sound better with a clean sound for nice chords and slower playing. The gel picks sound really bright and clear when distorted. With the gel picks, you can play a little faster, but its really not noticeable at all. If you're wandering the derlin picks are red, nylon picks are yellow, and the gel picks and pick in the picture, but more purplish without light. These are great picks if you want to try out all of the dava picks at a great price and fast shipping!",2
7166,"Very good quality and great price!

I'm a beginning player and needed an assortment of stiffness, so I ordered both the thin and medium picks.

These are comfortable to hold, and not too slippery.",2

7168,Been using these strings for a long time. Very consistent in both quality and tone.,2
7169,Industry standard thumbpicks.  I find these comfortable and consistent.  Bottom line: They work well!  Packed nicely for shipment and arrived promptly.,2
7170,This pedal is great.  Just as good as a Boss. The pedal has different effects settings.  Gets a nice airy tone out it.  I have the most fun with this pedal.  For the cost its right on target.,2

7172,"I've tried experimenting with several other strings for my guitars, however, I've decided that I will stick with Elixir from now on.  Strings sound better than others I have tried and always last longer.  I use Elixir for both my acoustic and electric guitars.  I use the Heavy NANOWEB on my Godin LGX-SA, to blend the acoustic and electric outputs.  They sound especially great on the acoustic output, giving me a the full bright tone I like.",2

7174,I like this thing even for recording at times,2
7175,"Didn't want to mess around with any of those make-it-yourself-break-it-yourself patch cables, so just went with good old Hosa. These get the job done on my pedal board just fine and I have had zero issues with them. No new noise to report whatsoever.",2
7176,Good cables for your pedal board and a good price.,2
7177,"This is a fantastic full single voice synth and will fit many people's needs. (1) If you're after a low-cost monosynth with that classic Moog sound, this will be great once paired with a MIDI keyboard, although you can actually use the softkeys as a keyboard. (2) If you want a sequencer, this is a great one with a lot of features. (3) If you're looking to get into modular, the 32 point patchbay is fantastic and this is again a very low-cost option for a full voice.

I wasn't sure I wanted to go modular, but after getting this and starting to learn a few basics about patching, I am just about to order some additional Eurorack modules. There are some full voice modules but they tend to start at the same price as the Moog Mother while not including a MIDI interface, a sequencer, the touch pad, or power. The fact that you get all this at this price point, plus a great Moog sound, is really amazing!",2

7179,"Love the Makala brand.  Have a baritone, soprano and now a tenor.  The tenor arrived a couple days ago.  Only issue the string action was a bit low so it was causing some buzzing at  the first fret.  Lucky I know how to correct these types of things or I would have possibly sent it back for an other one.  Great tone at a great price.",2

7181,Delivered on time and as described.  A useful purchase.,2
7182,"I have always been weary of putting new screws into any instrument. This didn't end up being a problem for me because the supplied screws were the exact same size as the ones that were already in my Dean bass. The installation was pretty straightforward, just be careful that you don't use a screwdriver with too wide of a shaft. It would have been nice if the instructions had suggested easier tools for getting on the retaining clip.

There are a couple issues I have encountered. I have found that straplocks extend out just enough to stop my guitar and bass from fitting in the case. Of course that's easily remedied by taking of the strap (which is best to do anyways before packing up), but it's just one more step that can be annoying if you're in a hurry to pack up or get started. Also, I've found that they sometimes rattle a bit when used on my acoustic bass. At some point I'll go in and add some additional padding to remedy the looseness of the fittings.",2

7188,"I've had my Standard Tele (in Lake Placid Blue) for 6 years now. I bought it just before the price went up from $369 to $499. Back then they called it an MIM (Made in Mexico) Standard Telecaster.

I have been jamming every Friday for several years now, and was just thinking what a great guitar this has been and still is. I've done nothing to this guitar other than change strings (I use 10-46). Our weekly jams are always recorded, so I have plenty of time to listen to the guitar while mixing the songs.

I rarely play any of the other electric guitars I bought before I bought the Tele. None of them play or sound as good. Over the past thirty years I bought (in order) an Ibanez Pro Les Paul copy, a Steinberger Spirit, a Vaccaro with the aluminum neck and Bigsby, a Jackson with the Sustaniac pickup, and finally, a Rickenbacker 360 Fireglow. I was always looking for something more. I got it with this guitar. It's more than likely the last electric guitar I will buy. If I lost the other 5 guitars it would make little difference to me. If I lost this Tele, I'd buy it again.  It's tried and true.",2
7189,Worked perfectly as expected.,2
7190,"I got this because I converted a spare guitar into a slide guitar using the Grover GP1103 Perfect Guitar Nut. I needed something to support the neck so I could actually use a tonebar. It does the job, has plenty of angles to support the necks of a variety of different instruments (bass, guitar, electrics, acoustics, ukulele, mandolin). I'm not a careless buffoon, so I don't use it when I change my guitar strings. But it's great for slide guitar!",2
7191,"Amazing tuner, super accurate. Cancels volume on your instrument while you're tuning which is cool. LED lights are easily seen. You can also strum your instrument and it will display all the strings and show which ones need tuned which is perfect for shows and live performances on stage. Only things I dislike are when the tuner is on but you're not tuning your instrument (when the strings are not vibrating at all) because random letters or numbers will appear on the screen sometimes. It's no problem though. Also, for bass guitar (what I use it with) it doesn't always recognize your instrument as being a BASS so it will show all 6 strings which is rather confusing. Great pedal.",2
7192,Never break!,2
7193,"My first power supply for my pedalboard. Using to power eight 9v pedals. Works fantastic. No issues whatsoever with buzzing. Going to buy a second one ASAP.

Display style + color display

size

Cons:
The tuner isn't as responsive as I would like. Sometimes it takes a while before it realizes what note is being played, especially for non-standard tunings.
It does not have ""True bypass""  but that isn't really important",2
7219,"Right off the this neck does NOT come with a nut pre-installed, you will have to purchase one separately. Now, for the aesthetics, this neck is not made from one solid piece of maple, such as an All Parts, Warmoth, or Mighty Mite, neck. They use a separate maple fretboard that is glued to the neck, I noticed that the heel of the neck also contained another piece that was glued, leading me to believe these are ply stocks.

In any case, it's a great neck. I am EXTREMELY please with the overall product, I've purchase name brand necks, such as those listed above, and still had to dress the frets, file the edges, and in some cases, level the frets or straighten a warp.

So, to conclude, if I can purchase a quality neck for a fourth of the price, why would I EVER want to spend more? There are some give and takes to consider, but all in all, I'm a happy customer.",2
7220,Best rosin by far.  No mess.  Clean application.  Clean pulling on the string.  Beautiful stuff,2
7221,"The design on this wall guitar hook is as follows. There is a strong steel plate finished in black that mounts to the wall. Be sure and find a stud to attach it to. Mounting anything to drywall using plugs and screws even though they supply two of them for you is just asking for trouble. Dry wall is really 1/2"" of powder loosely held together. So I wouldn't trust my guitars on it. Finding a stud is easy if you don't have a stud finder, you can simply use your knuckle tapping on the wall. You will notice a very hollow sound in between studs, and then as you approach a stud the sound will continue to change until it hits a peak, and then starts to degrade on the other side of it. You could try drilling a pin hole in the spot where you think it is and expect to see some wood dust come out after you get through the dry wall.

Okay so this strong steel plate has two holes in it, upper and lower. It is a rectangular plate. In the middle of the plate is a threaded center with an extended sleeve collar to allow for even more thread depth than a simple plate provides. Also included is a foam plate that acts like a buffer between your wall and the steel plate. As one reviewer mentioned that makes a great template for where to drill the holes. The two screws provided are good for using to attach directly into a stud. They also are the right size of course for the two dry wall plugs to be used with.

The threaded rod portion of the holder never extends long enough to touch the rod to the wall. The raised offset cone is steeper than that. So for example if you tightened this all the way down before attaching it to the wall just to see how it works, the final twists are real, real tight in order to get it into the proper position. I can't imagine any guitar needing more strength than that.

I tried is on one of my Telecaster guitars so even with a Tele neck that has a bulge on the one side, and nothing on the other.it creates a secure fit. If you attach this to just dry wall, and then therefore afraid to fully tighten the forks all the way down, then yes I can see a concern, but that's not the way to install it. Install the plate directly into a stud, tighten the screws of the plate all the way down to real tight, and then when placing the wooden cover over the plate, and inserting the threaded rod of the forks in tighten the heck out of it. Don't be afraid to really get it snug in order to have the forks line up with the U shape facing up.

The directions are for the most part covering the butt of the manufacturer when they tell you to not use it for more than 15 pounds. They also tell you to not fully tighten the rod down, and that it should be loose. Using it that way would enable you to use different headstock styles on the same hook so I could see that, but if you are using one type of guitar neck headstock style then to me fasten it all the way down. The challenge is to get it into the proper position without over tightening the nut. That is where I realized that there is a good amount of latitude in that regard. I got it snug and it went the rest of the way around to the proper position, and making for a super snug non-movable fit.",2

7223,"This is a good package, but I wish it had two more covers for the heads (only came with enough to cover all but two) and the chain of inputs is not adjustable, so you will always have a big ball of chords at the end of your pedal board if you don't use more than a few pedals.",2

It comes with plugs in the banana plug output. Apparently, this is done to avoid europeans from plugging the typical 220 v plug into this.. Stupid reason but I guess that is the reason.. No where are the instructions/comments about this.

As a ride you can either use it as a left-side ride or place it as a far right ride.

Although it's unlike its larger sibling when it comes to projection, it is very much like it when it comes to complex tones when riding it. And like the rest of the cymbals in this line, it is somewhat wild and trashy when you first get them, but tame down as they are played in. The first few months of heavy playing yields steady changes, and the cymbal will settle in at around the six month mark. The play-in process can be hastened with a regimen of mallet rolls. This entails taking a pair of mallets and rolling them around the cymbal for 20 minutes per day for a week or so. Start at the outside edge and work your way towards the bell, going around the circumference of the cymbal.

Paired with a larger ride (or even as the only ride on small kits), and a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-BHH14-Bliss-Series-14-Hi-Hat-Cymbals/dp/B005GXLFRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream BHH14 Bliss Series 14 Hi-Hat Cymbals""</a>&nbsp;will give you a set of cymbals for lighter volume music that rivals anything Zildjian offers (among the 35 cymbals I own, all are Zildjian except for a set of Dream Bliss.)

7241,I have purchased many piano benches in my lifetime because I own a music school. The OnStage brand is one of my top brands to purchase from because they have a great reputation among music schools and in the industry.

I would purchase another one when needed and I recommend this model to my students.,2

7250,"The super cool gold Jetsons case is nice. Open it up and you immediately smell chocolate and this thing looks so good you could almost eat it. The neck is thin and flat and wide almost like an Ibanez Wizard neck. The action is easily adjustable thanks to the super low frets. The body and paint is superb. Included in the case is a photo of your guitar on the work-shop table being inspected. I was skeptical of the G-Force but after bending a lot of notes hit a button and I'm back in tune. Plugging it in it has some pleasant tones especially from the bridge pickup ( although I think they should have went with BurstBuckers instead ). The pearl inlays are back and they look great. Its really easy to play and resonates nicely as I can strum it unplugged and still entertain myself. 10/10 would buy again

Update 8/2/2015: after spending a few weeks with this guitar here are my thoughts. I still just love this guitar! The only thing I would change would probably be the pickups. Although I like the 57 classics I like the sound of the BurstBucker Pros better. The BB Pros just found fatter and fuller to my ears.

The G Force is still going strong. I saved a custom tuning and it was pretty easy. I can go from standard A440 to e-flat to Esus2 open tuning to Drop D tuning in seconds. I have no problem with the G Force.",2

7271,"I bought one of these little guitars from Guitar Center and love it.  It's fun to play, and more convenient than pulling out a full-size instrument.

Tuning:  Since it's about 2 frets longer than a standard uke, I prefer tuning the high string to G (instead of A).  Otherwise the tension on the strings is a bit high (and sounds more like a mandolin).  Also, at G it sounds surprisingly deep for such a tiny guitar, without the strings sounding floppy at all.

The tone of the instrument is somewhat the combination of a guitar, mandolin and uke. I'm tempted to lower the action a hair.",2
7272,very good,2

This strap was clearly made with Gretsch guitars in mind, meaning, it has small mounting holes meant to be used with Gretsch's very cool and secure, but non-standard screw-on strap pegs.  To use it with any other guitar you will have to either enlarge the holes, or do what I did, which I think is a better way to go, cut SMALL slits upwards and wrestle the strap onto the peg.

7285,"I bought this bass from Ebay for $100.  I am thinking about buying another one and fit it with a bridge pickup.  Many people compare it to Fender and other long scale basses.  The comparison is rather inadequate because this is a distinct instrument with a distinct feel and tone.  If you are looking for that vintage muddy bass sound from 60s and 70s you cannot go wrong with this baby. This bass is FAT with a muddy rumble, a low end monster. There's nothing bright about this bass. The over-wound and over-sized humbucker delivers, no doubt about that.  I play it through 200W Fender Bassman and it rocks the house, pictures falling off the walls!. Ditching the stock round wound strings for more classy flat wounds would improve the feel and sound. Excellent bass if you are into blues and jazz-blues.

It is solidly built with quality hardware and a very user friendly bridge.  You may need to tweak the neck and bridge a bit because the factory preset action is way too low which may cause string buzz.",2

However, (unlike EB's or D'darrios) my fingers lost the the argument with my ears when it came to the string gauge. There's a definate distinction between 9's and 10's. I had to go with stiffer strings to get the sound I wanted.",2

7305,"UPDATE: I have had these speakers for 4 years now. I have realized that unbalanced cabling will create a slight amount of hiss/noise in the speakers, but my Focusrite only has TRS outputs and I only own TS cables... So I just used TS to XLR adapters on the speakers and connected to the XLR input and the speakers are dead silent. I understand that makes very little sense from an electrical standpoint, but hey it works. The speakers are still awesome, and they do translate well.

These speakers, are really nice, I was surprised at their weight, they are built pretty solid. They have a high end I've never experienced in this range. They put your music under a microscope and will make things sound bad.... these are not listening speakers.  Many complain about the bass, but you have to realize, these are 5"" monitors, you can't expect much from them. [just buy a subwoofer]. They have a EQ on the back for adjustments, and a 'Room Control' switch, which according to the manual, you can use to counter the effects of putting them near a wall or in a corner. I find myself never falling out of the sweet spot, its quite wide. Also, I wanted to mention that you can put TS cables in the TRS input, no issue. The speakers don't pop when you turn them on, you just get a pleasant light. They have little fences in front of the tweeter, which the absence of it and a small child were the death of a older set of passive monitors.

PROS
-Built like a tank
-Awesome sound all the way from 80hz and up. (they still cover a little farther down)
-Point out little details.
-Adequate bass for 5"" monitors
-EQ
-Room Control
-Big sweet spot
-Good bi-amped sound
-Never get to hot.
-Don't make that annoying pop sound.
-Protected Tweeter.

Neutral
-Rather heavy for 5"" monitors.",2

The first one I received leaked air, enough that I didn't want to play it that much (though it was better than the other one I ordered at the same time).  Their customer service had e-mailed me letting me know they were there if I had questions, so I responded with the problem I was having with this one.

I thought it was much too ""bright"" sounding.  He basically told me that the only difference between a Beta 57 and a Beta 58 is the wind screen.  The 58 windscreen sets the element back farther, which takes away some of the harsh overtones.  I switched to a 58 windscreen and it is a perfect vocal solution.  Clear, bright but without any harshness.  I have a 58  where we rehearse (the Beta only comes out at gigs) and I can hear the difference.

After using it for a little while, I found out that it does fit my neck good, and stays in place, but some of my harps, like my Hohner Special 20s and others do not fit to well or rest to well in the holder. They set to far back. My Lee Oskar harps fit better, because they are a little bit wider. Thats just my observation. Mine has the big black wingnut on it. I also bought the Hohner 10 hole holder, which I think fits me better, but its made in China, where as this one is made in Germany. Oh well trade one thing for another.",2

7327,"In my time as a DSLR video producer, audio has always been a struggle. Initially, the battle (unwinnable though it may have been), was against AGC hiss. With the release and (near) perfection of Magic Lantern, the fight was against super flat sounding audio and unevenly loud background noise. Ive said it once, and Ill say it again: I would be endlessly happy if I never had to deal with a piece of audio ever again.

Fed up with the internal audio recording capabilities of my Canon, I began exploring external recording options. Because I largely work alone, I needed a solution that provided great audio, while keeping all the connections and monitoring interfaces within arms reach. First was a lavalier mic with an attached recording device (inconsistent quality, difficult to monitor while on a one-man shoot.) Next I tried the Zoom H4N. Although the output was great, it was hard to attach to my DSLR for moving shots.

I feel as though Ive found the best possible solution with the Tascam DR60. Beyond the audio recording quality (which is superb) and ease of use, the ability to sandwich it between my DSLR and tripod/Steadicam is the biggest selling point on the device. After a two day shoot using it, I found it to be very easy to use, relatively battery efficient, and compatible with both XLR and 1/8th inch-driven mics.

If there is a qualm I have with it, it is the lightweight housing. The DR60s industrial design belies its plasticky body. Also, the fact that it doesnt come with an SDHC card seems cheap at best. An 8GB card is almost negligibly expensive to produce, and when I realized I had to go to Best Buy the morning of my shoot, I was less than pleased.  I didn't let that effect my rating, however.  This is a well designed device, and nothing else comes close.",2

But when I figured out how easy it went on I try it in different places on my drums and each time it got easyer. In fact I ordered 3 more. They are a little pricey . But the material they use is very forgiving if you put it on the way the instructions shows. Just don't force it to much. It all so doesn't interfere with the drum head rim. I recommend this mount.,2

7332,"These may not have the same silky smooth feel as some of my more pricey tuners, but I'm not detecting much slop out of them, either. I also like that the knobs are like the old 'convex' Kluson'ish non-sealed tuners. The washers are kind of funky big in diameter, but I only noticed because I've got a bunch of other guitars to compare them to.

The plating seems nice (e.g. there are no flaws that jumped out at me, but at the low price these cost, I'm not going to be anal enough to scrutinize them). The little screws that fasten the tuners on the backside installed w/o the heads stripping out. Granted, I took the time to drill proper pilot holes, but even then, some of the cheaper screws can strip.

These tuners are honestly better than many other budget sealed tuners that cost me probably at least $10 more. If you like building project guitars, or if you need to upgrade a few budget ones, these are a great solution.",2

The tires are smaller but usuable on hard surfaces (my RNR goes on grass, sand, mud, hard surfaces, this only hard surfaces otherwise the wheels bog down).  Also the foldable handles are smaller, shorter.  Still, it's a great sled aside from these differences and I'd probably order another.",2

You get a great set of genuine Fender pickups and good electronics. This is a true Fender Jazz bass all the way. The neck is fantastic, fast and smooth.
You cannot go wrong with this bass.
If you are either a beginner, intermediate or professional player, this bass holds true for any level you are.
If you get this as a beginner, it will last you for many many years. The one with the rose wood fingerboard is a bit warmer and the one with the maple fingerboard is a bit more focused. I have them both.

7347,"I bought this here on Amazon for $34. At the time of this review, it is $33. I say this because everywhere else it is around $90, and the price here may go up.

This is my first mic looper, but I have used a few other guitar loopers in the past. This is a very solid looper, and for the price I got it at, it can't be beat.

PROS:
- I like that there is a volume knob. It makes it easy to adjust the volume of the loop after its already begun
- button is easy to press and there is no lag.
- Lights indicate what it is currently doing
- The price. Holy crap the price. $34 for a looper pedal? Crazy! This compared to the $90 Ditto mic looper, or the $200+ Boss loopers etc. is amazing.
- Jam Sync will allow you to connect it to other digitech jam man loopers. I haven't used this feature but I could see how it would be really nice if you are looping other instruments as well. I use a Zoom looper for my bass and timing the two exactly can be very difficult. I'm considering getting a jamman looper for guitars so that I can make sure they line up precisely

CONS:
- Only one step button makes it difficult to control sometimes. You have to double stomp to turn it off, which can be tricky to nail the timing on, especially if you're playing another instrument at the same time. Compare this to the ditto mic looper.
- There is no on/off switch. It seems to turn on immediately when you plug it into the wall, which isn't awful but it's a little weird
- It doens't show you if there is still a loop stored in it or not. So if you stop it you have to remember to clear it before creating a new loop. Could be embarrassing in a show.

BOTTOM LINE:
If this is still priced at around $35, go ahead and get it. It works great and that price is impossible to beat. If not, this is still a very good looper though it does have a few drawbacks. I haven't used the Ditto Mic Looper so I can't say which one is better barring price. I give it a 4.5/5 overall, but a 6/5 for price.",2
7348,good selection,2
7349,We tried using the keyboard on a desk - not good.  This works perfectly and is needed to get the maximum use of both the keyboard and stand.,2
7350,"I've used this style of Dunlop straps for years and I love them. The first set I ever bought was about 8 years ago, and they are still in perfect condition! Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a solid straplock.",2
7351,"This is a great unit for what it does.  The guitar effects are useable but I have a processor so I'm just interested in the harmonizer.  Why this one and not the Voicelive Play?  This one reads what you play and selects the key automatically and follows you even if you change keys during the song.  It also has midi in for keyboards. It takes a while to dial in what you're looking for.  I have edited and renamed 10 programs that I use all the time.  The edits sometimes are subtle and then some I've really tweaked.  I have one that I've named BU135, or back up 1-3-5.  The unit didn't really have a preset for just backups....only lead vocals with backups so BU135 is a backup harmony program. It's very easy to edit and the best thing is that the pitch correction is adjustable.  The unit I had before this was the Harmony Gxt.  The pitch correction was either on or off so at times you could hear the unit searching for the harmony note.  It was especially prevalent on recordings but with the Voicelive Play GTX its completely adjustable.  The gender selection is fun too...you can have female or male backup singers available.  If you play in a band with limited vocal power or do a solo (I do both) this unit fills the gaps.  It's not as good as real singers but then again you don't have to pay it either.",2
7352,"It is what it is.  The value of this product is virtually impossible to beat (what one gets for what one pays).  That said, I'm accustomed to the  Sennheiser E835 dynamic Mic -- awesome tone.  So, I'm searching for a condenser mic at a different price-point with the tone I want.  Yes, I recommend this as a great start-up package.  The desk swivel arm makes me nervous so I purchased a desk-top boom stand...that solved it.  I also purchased the separate phantom power box for $21.  Use this product  for its intended purpose and you are good-to-go.",2
7353,"You can buy two of these snakes for about half the price of buying one 24 channel snakes.  Every channel tested perfect as soon as I received the package.  It should hold up fairly well, as my needs are pretty simple.",2
7354,"I bought these because they were slightly less expensive than the Ernie Balls, and they're pretty good. It only took 2 days for them to stretch out to where they'd stay in tune. That's about average I guess. I'll see how these work out. They came in a 3 pack, so they'll last me a while.",2
7355,Works great - well worth the money!,2
7356,Probably the best brand of polish on the market. It doesn't leave a film like residue like other polishes do and it smells amazing too.,2
7357,Good Product !!!,2
7358,"Great pick, good grip and long lasting!",2
7359,"I'm constantly auditioning dirt pedals and I am an EHX fan. In the last 2 years I've had a Luna, Double Muff, Ultimate Drive, Hot Tubes, Tall Font Russian, EQD Monarch and a Swollen Pickle. I read that this was another OCD type pedal, like the Ultimate Drive and I wanted to try it out. I've never actually played a real OCD so I can't tell you the difference.

This is a very tight sounding overdrive. No fizz or jangly sound and it doesn't have as much wash as the UD. It's a very tight and punchy sound. Marshall-esque in that regard. It's a medium gain pedal and I'm using it as my overdriven sound at about the same volume as my clean sound. It cleans up my Tall Font Russian (my main distortion/muff style) fuzz very well so that I can palm mute and have some mid breakthrough in the mix. They sound amazing together.

Right now I'm not using the tone shift much, it makes the pedal much louder and increases the mids a lot, like a beefier tubescreamer. It's kind of a dark sounding pedal as well and I'm keeping the tone at 3 to open it up. I'm also running it at 18V.

Cool thing about this pedal is that you can run it at 18V on a 9V power supply (per the manual). I like the 18V sound, it's less compressed.

How does it compare? Well, it's taken over the OD spot on my board and sounds great through my Fender NOS Blues Jr. For the price you can't beat it. It's a great value and you'll enjoy it if you like UD/Marshall sounds.",2
7360,"This is a must for musicians. It's the greatest invention since peanut butter! A great product, and thank you for your promptness in sending it.",2
7361,"Original Fender part. Expensive, but was needed for a vintage restoration project.",2
7362,"Solid, comfortable strap-- nicely made with clean stitching, thick nylon fabric, and solid (plastic) adjusting hardware.

I added some dunlop strap-locks to this and it's a great instrument strap, I'm totally confident I'm not going to lose my bass for any reason.",2
7363,Great Key! Great Seller!,2
7364,CTS is the minimum quality one should use for replacing pots in electric musical instruments.,2
7365,"I ordered one of these ""$14 guitars"" but with $21 shipping, they were $35. I teach children and wanted to see if one of these would hold a tune and how the sound was. They hold their tune decently and sound pretty good for their price. Fret placement is a bit off. For example, when you play the G on the E string, it is almost a G#. I just ordered 3 more, so I'll see how consistent this problem is. However, this fret displacement should not distract the kids from learning unless they have a really fine ear for tuning. Overall, great and economical starter guitar. Although it is smaller, I will be using it for the older students as well. It is fine to start on.

The ones that learn, can always trade up their guitars for a better one.

It is nice it comes with a cheap bag, strap, pitch pipe (the pipe is toy quality), and an electronic tuner. The tuner doesn't come with battery, so I have yet to try it.",2
7366,My go to strings right now for my strat. Excellent! They sound great and if you keep them clean they last a while.,2
7367,"I'm an electrical engineer.  I'm very picky about electrical connections.  We always say, if its not a good mechanical connection its not a good electrical connection.  These are solid mechanically and a good deal if you're putting together a pedal board and trying to determine cable lengths.  I buy my gear online so it was nice not to have to decide what i needed before purchasing, I just got this and wired everything up.  Solid and dependable.",2
7368,"I always loved these Yamaha Classical Guitars. Perfect sound, easy to play and very inspirational. Well constructed, does not buzz, nice neck and body finish, I would change the strings, makes it sound better. It is my main composing guitar at this point, I simply love it. Why the four stars....well because there are way better guitars out there, but for this price, you simply cannot find a better nylon string anywhere. Perfect addition to my collection. Buy One",2
7369,"Installed these on my Bugera T50, not regretting doing so.",2
7370,"Noiseless, awesome value. Will buy again.",2
7371,"I needed to replace my old snare head, and this one was a great choice! Received it today and already love it, I would recommend it, buy it!",2
7372,"After using Rico reeds for a year, we switched to Vandoren and never looked back. They are far superior in tone, texture, strength. The Rico's cracked easily and had lousy tone (easy to squeak) Intead of using two reeds a week we are now using 2 reeds a month. Huge difference!",2
7373,"Quite a beutiful guitar. Decent sound and playability. After tightening up the hardware, and adjusting the neck, it now holds tune just fine. I suppose the best compliment that I can give is that I purchased a second guitar, for my son. While this won't be a family heirloom for anything but sentimental reasons, the price is right, and it is a joy to play.",2
7374,"Great tuners and so compact and sensitive. Bought two for my guitars, then bought two more for my pickin' buddies. They are small and fit out of the way on the headstock.",2
7375,This thing sounds amazing. The sound is just what I was looking for. Ships in nice box too. Will buy other products. TKs.,2
7376,"This thing is sweet! I hooked it up quickly, but it was intimidating at first...then once you learn how it attaches, you get a rhythm going and before you know it, it's all set up. It works great, I don't hear it affecting the kick drum sound. It keeps my mic in place where I like it. And I was able to ditch the outside boom stand (I had this crazy rig with a brick...yea weird)...gigging with it would be one less mic stand on stage to trip over.",2
7377,"My daughter would not use a chin rest, until I Bought Her This one.  She is happy with it.",2
7378,"I read that Tom Petty used one of these so of course I had to have one. I installed it myself on my Alvarez acoustic and it only took about 20 minutes. I've mainly put it to use in a Beatles acoustic cover duo. It's not the holy grail for acoustic tone but it does capture the early Beatles tone well. I like a smoother, more ""pretty"" strumming tone (think Eagles - Tequila Sunrise) and I never got exactly there with this pickup, even using the Baggs D.I. to smooth the tone. It's still very good for live shows though and I'm glad I made the purchase.",2
7379,"This is the BEST music stand on the market.  Heavy gauge aluminum and steel--sturdy, and stable.  The desk easily accommodates a large binder or book of music.  The stand adjusts without tools, levers, or knobs.  You just pull up or push down to adjust the height, and tilt the desk backward or forward to suit your preference.  Its adjustable height allows it to be used while sitting or standing.

I have been using my other Manhasset weekly for 7 or 8 years now, and it's still firm and stable.  I  routinely place a large (1.5 "") 3-ring binder, full of music, and a large hymnal, on top of the binder, on my stand.  No problems at all.  Sometimes, I need to spread three or four pieces of sheet music out across the desk...I use my open binder to extend the width a bit in those cases.  Again, no problem!

This stand is not foldable or compact.  It is a full-size concert stand.  But, if you want a good-looking, reliable, sturdy, long-lasting music stand, consider the Manhasset.  There is also a table-top model available.",2
7380,Very cool box. I use it with a mic for acoustic instruments. It has Phantom power...good deal.,2
7381,its great and durable,2
7382,Cable seemed good quality but ended up having to return the mic I got it for so no longer had a needed for it and can't return it. Gave it to my friend who is in the recording industry.,2
7383,"Better than i expected, I will buy from them in the future.",2
7384,"If it were possible to give this mixer 10 Stars - I would! Prior to this I used a similar sized mixer from a company whose name begins with a ""B"" and ends in an ""R"". I decided to see if Mackie was truly an upgrade. This was my first purchase of Mackie gear of any kind! I am a mobile DJ that uses this type of mixer as a sub mixer to route my DJ controller, a hardwired mic and a wireless mic. Sometimes, I'll route a back up mixing console through the mixer as well.
The Construction is TOP SHELF. This thing is SOLID. All metal with exception to the knobs. The mic pre-amps are clean, powerful and very rich sounding. Depending on the gear that you're putting though it, I find myself using less EQ to balance out my sound.
OUTPUTS- I was first drawn to this mixer because it has XLR Balanced outputs - I just like that better than 1/4"" TRS outputs. You can get roughly 2 more mixes out of this board as well - making it a 3 Bus Board.
I don't really use effects, and there are none built-in. There is a Power Switch on the rear - my previous mixer didn't have a power switch. I like a power switch!
The LED display is VERY accurate. I have experienced better response from my powered speakers and a cleaner - tighter mix because the ability to SEE what's happening!
The MIC channels have a MUTE Button!!! I love that as well!
Many of the things that I am raving about are very standard issue on larger mixers from most manufacturers. Again, my previous mixer was a plain-jane mixer. I can't allow myself to bad mouth the ""B"" brand - they served me well over the years. I will gladly attest to Mackie's Overall Quality! This board is a STEAL at this price point!!! I can see myself owning this board for many years to come.",2
7385,It is a great amp for the money! Beats the crap out of two 8 ohm Podium Pro 15 inch subwoofers wired in parallel for 4 ohms without clipping. I can't wait to order another one.,2
7386,"The voice button makes my vocals sound waaaaaaay better!  I don't know why anyone wouldn't use it.  Good FX, EQ, Speaker, small, light.  I only wish it would mount on the lower (thicker) part of the mic stand.  It only fits on the upper (thinner) part that extends up.  But overall, totally worth it!",2
7387,"What a deal!  I have the unfortunate difficulty of hands that just turn strings to rust.  I generally can only get 2-3 weeks on a set of strings (pathetic).  So its important that I have quality strings that I can still afford!  I have used other strings like Elixir which did last a bit longer, but not long enough to justify the higher price!  I use 10s on my strat, les paul and 335.  These strings offer great sound on all my guitars and are a fabulous deal in the 3 set pack.  Nothing like the feel of new strings!

5 stars!  Rock on!",2
7388,"Like every thing about it. Have been playing bass for 40 years professionally and have been through many pedals. I use a Sans Amp Tech 21 DI for tube emulation and bought this for use with solos and light chorus flavor. Perfect with knobs creating various degrees and types of effect.

7395,"Previously I wrote a review regarding the Makala Shark Bridge Soprano Ukulele.  Unfortunately, with that particular uke, it arrived in very disappointing fashion.  The workmanship [or lack thereof] and quality control issues forced us returning it, and spending an additional $10 for the Kala Mahogany Soprano Ukulele.  Let me just say that the differences between these two Ukuleles is truly like night and day

for those of you who DIDN'T read my previous review, I will say that I've been a guitarist for over 25 years.  I have a lot of experience in the construction, setup, and playing of acoustic and electric stringed instruments.  Specifically I am a rock and metal player, but cull experience from nearly every genre of music.  My wife and I were searching for an inexpensive  beginner's ukulele for a 5 year old girl to use for her first foray into music.  Upon ordering the ukes, we had them delivered to us so that I could go over them, make sure that they were properly constructed and setup prior to sending to her.  Being that I have given MANY lessons in my day, and have encountered many different instruments, I know that THE most common reason that a student gives up on a stringed instrument is if it is poorly set-up [i.e., physically hard to play].  NO stringed instrument should require a Herculean amount of strength.

The Kala Ukulele arrived very well packedby both Amazon and from the company.  Upon taking the ukulele out of it's second inner most packing box, I could immediately see that it was in fact made of mahogany [intentional mislabeling of construction wood is an unfortunate part of inexpensive guitars and stringed instruments].  Not only is this actual mahogany, but it is a very excellent example of mahogany.  The wood is a deep shade of brown with a dark black grain running throughout.  The pores of the wood [a tale tale sign of true mahogany] are very visible and clearly indicate that this is an excellent example of mahogany.

The fretwork is EXEMPLARY.  I've seen $400-$500 guitars have fretwork not as good as this.  The brass frets are all properly seated and well finished.  For anyone familiar with guitars and stringed instruments, fret ends [the point at which your hand makes contact up and down the neck] can be a very troubling point of contact with inexpensive instruments.  However, these frets have been manicured to a level that there is no sensation whatsoever.

Another point of emphasis: the nut.  The nut, in my estimation is one of THE most important parts of any stringed instrument.  A nut should be properly cut as to allow the strings to move without binding [binding creates issues with tuning and intonation] and the nut slots should be cut as so to allow the strings a downward trajectory into the tuning machines [maximizing resonance and projection of the instrument].  Again, this instrument is exemplary as it relates to the nut.  The nut is a plastic ""bone facsimile"" and it is properly cut with an attention to detail I could never have expected at this price point.

Tuning CAN be a bit tedious with this ukethe tuners are VERY pedestrian, but at $53 [most tuning machine sets cost more than this ukulele did] one shouldn't expect them to be more than utilitarian.  Please be prepared for the tuning machines to slip a bit when tuningit's very easy to get impatient, but if you take your time it will get to pitch.  Once you've tuned the ukulele, as with any stringed instrument, it will be important to stretch the strings and then retune at least two additional times before optimal tuning stability will be achieved.

Upon tuning the ukulele, and strumming some chords, I quickly realized what a gem this truly is.  The uke is dynamic, resonant, and truly is the sum of all the aforementioned parts.  Single notes sing out and have great harmonic content.  Chords ring and project very well.  I have played every note on the fingerboard and none of them are dead or have any intonation issues whatsoever.

To put this in perspective, I just bought myself a guitar three weeks ago.  It cost me $2,500.  It is the epitome of modern guitar construction and is arguably the greatest stringed instrument I've ever played.  But this $53 Kala Uke has a home, in my home, right next to that guitar.  I'm not comparing the two; I'm simply saying that the playability is such that I WILL be buying myself one once this goes to our granddaughter.  The ""dollars per smile"" ratio on this thing is incomprehensible.  I can not say enough about this Ukulele and if you're in the market for a Uke PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy one.  You will NOT be disappointed, nor will you regret it for one single solitary minute.",2

7399,"I play a Taylor Big Baby. When I started playing guitar in church, I needed to amplify it. I really wanted to maintain the sound of the acoustic guitar--I didn't want to have an acoustic that sounded like an electric. I considered buying a 314ce, but at $1799, it was an expensive prospect. Instead, I decided to give this a go. I bought it here on Amazon and took it to my local guitar shop for installation. After it was installed, I took it and a 314 and ran them both through the most expensive Fishman acoustic amp I could find. I believe that the this K&K pickup has a superior natural guitar tone to even Taylor's lauded expression system! Highly recommended for those who want to keep their acoustic guitars sounding acoustic.",2
7400,Simple DI box seems to work as it is supposed to. Cheap enough to buy 2 in case one goes out while on the road.,2
7401,"Wow. I got these cans 2 days ago, and I must say, they are easily the best sounding headphones that I have owned. They honestly do sound like the amazing ATH-M50's, and these even have a fighting chance against Sennheisers. They don't have the flattest response in the industry, but for the price, you simply cannot go wrong.",2
7402,"I now have 2 of these, so that should tell you that I think they work great, small can easily fit in a guitar case or gig bag.",2

7412,Overall I like the construction. I didn't play with them much because I have a deformed right hand and they didn't fit my thumb well because it has a slight curve in it. But they would fit a normal thumb very well.,2
7413,"If your on a tight budget and you have a condenser mic that needs a ""Phantom Power"" supply, this is what you want. Around $20, completely quiet. No humming or buzzing sounds.",2
7414,"Ever since the Gauss speaker company folded, I have used these. Gauss was the only other American speaker brand that could compete with these.

I still have the original Electro Voice EVM12L's I started using 35 years ago in original HiWatt 4x12 stacks. (four of those monsters!)

They have survived numerous tours, countless recording sessions, rehearsals and thousands of gigs. They have been frozen and baked in trucks. I have never had one fail despite the brutal wattage Marshall & HiWatt amps produce. They always sound ""right."" Response is sweet in the high-end, tight in the low end (in closed-back cabs) and clear throughout all ranges.

These have the correct Fs point for guitar (around 70 Hz) so they do not show terrible impedance to the amp on the low E string, thereby causing that flabby-bottom mud that deaf dumb guitarists mistake for ""warmth.""

Resonant frequency is THE CRUCIAL spec often overlooked by neophytes who mistakenly believe poetic mythological power-hyped descriptions of speakers.

You want the resonant frequency to be lower than the lowest note your instrument produces. For adult guitarists, that is the Low E which is around 81 Hz. If you're a drop-tuned distortion freak, then you need BASS speakers. But amazingly, these EV speakers will even withstand that insane torture. They are extremely over-engineered. That's a good thing.

BTW: speakers do not have ""sustain."" Disregard any manufacturer's hype that mentions such nonsense. It IS possible for a speaker with pronounced mid-frequency response to produce feedback, which morons equate with ""sustain."" Don't confuse sustain with feedback. Speakers cannot possibly produce any more natural sustain from your guitar. Crummy speakers will produce more feedback at certain frequencies. That is all.

These speakers are heavy. They MUST be to produce the acoustic output they do and withstand high-wattage. That is an unfortunate byproduct of physics law that cannot be broken. If you load a four x12"" cab with these, prepare to pay roadies and tip stage-hands. invest in wheels.

If you want this quality but have to move gear yourself, then get 1 x 12"" cabs, or 2 x 12"" max. I have had good luck with Traynor cabs because they are well-made, have proper dimensions and are built from real baltic birch plywood. There are other good brands of cabs out there, but none are better and most are more expensive than Traynor. So, if you are needing cabs to put these in, check out Traynor 1x12 and 2x12 cabs. A 2x12 cab with a pair of these will outperform and outlast any 4 x 12 loaded with inferior speakers. Therefore, you will actually SAVE money and lose equipment-weight using these.

You can drive yourself crazy looking at specs, frequency response-graphs and reading reviews.

There are only a few specs you absolutely must pay attention to for guitar speakers:

Fs: ( Free-Space ---resonant frequency--- must be lower than 80 Hz.)

Power-handling (must be at least double the RMS output of solid-state amps, higher for tube amps)

Frequency range. (must go to at least 5kHz, preferably higher. These go to 7kHz)

Sensitivity as measured in dB ( at 1 kHz & 1 watt) louder in generally better, but NOT the sole criteria.

These speakers qualify on all counts.

There are other excellent speakers from Brazil, Italy; B & C, Selenium, Faital, etc. But all of those are more expensive and NONE of them perform better for LOUD ELECTRIC GUITAR.

You want the best? Want reliability? Tone?

Save yourself hassle, time and money. Get these.

ONE CAVEAT: Don't be an idiot and try to wire your cabs for four ohms, ESPECIALLY if you use tube amps. That amateur monkey-business will NOT give you ""more output"" or anything else of any musical merit.

The ONLY reason manufacturers use low ohm schemes is so they can LIE about power ratings. Even if you have a good professional amp that can handle the ludicrous current-demands of low ohm speakers, you are not doing yourself any favors with 2 or 4 ohm loads.

Get these 8 ohm models for 2 x 12 cabs and wire them in series to make a 16ohm load. If you are filling a four-by 12 cab, you need the 16 ohm model so a series / parallel wiring scheme makes the ideal 16 ohm load.

Small speaker impedances like 4 ohm or 2 ohm are only for rating lies. Those are NEVER good for sound quality or reliability. 8 ohms is the LOWEST ohmage you should aim for, and if using real tube amps, wire your system for 16 ohms.  These speakers are for musicians, not DJs.",2
7415,As described,2
7416,Looks great when turned on.  Makes a great addition to our karaoke lounge in the basement.  4 star because of how loud it is.,2

7427,"Never buy strap locks. Those have proven to be garbage. Locking at the strap instead of a replacement locking button makes sense. Planet Waves makes a few different types, this is the least expensive one. D'Addario/Planet Waves should really specify a weight limit. While this strap works great for acoustics and lighter electrics I would not try to secure a All solid wood USA Les Paul with it. Fortunately they do make stronger versions for that.",2
7428,"I'm a professional keyboardist but not a pro piano player.

OK. This keyboard doesn't have any of the bells and whistles of the higher model Privias and Celviano digital pianos. It doesn't have an LED screen. It only has 18 voices. It doesn't have line outs. It doesn't have lines in. It doesn't have a USB flash drive input. It comes with cheap speakers.

But this keyboard has the same key bed and the same sound engine for its concert grand piano that the higher models have. So through headphones or through a stereo system, the PX-150 will sound just as good as Casio's highest model.

And let me tell you, this keyboard has a fantastic set of keys and a superb grand piano.

The keys are made to feel like ivory and ebony keys. They have a light grain to them. They feel like expensive piano keys, not like plastic keyboard keys. The keys are progressively heavier and slower as you go down and lighter and faster as you go up the scale like a real grand piano. The keyboard has wonderful resonance. On a real piano, if you play three notes with the damper pedal pressed, you will hear the sympathetic vibration of the strings that aren't being played. Casio has modeled this effect. A typical MIDI keyboard will transmit 127 different levels of velocity depending on how it's played. The Casio delivers 16,256 levels!

Only one voice on the keyboard has all of this detail, the concert grand piano. Through my $130 200W Logitech speakers that have a subwoofer and two satellites (keep the satellites resting on top of the PX-150 speakers) the Casio sounds just breathtaking. I can get thunderous fortes and the quietest pianissimos. There is balance throughout the keyboard's range. Casio's previous model had a quick decay in the midrange that frustrated me. The PX-150 has detailed expression. I am in love with this keyboard.

The other pianos and voices? They're very good. The electric piano is excellent. It has a great Rhodes sound.

Part of me wishes that I had spent the extra $200 for the PX-350 so that I could have the lines in and the USB flash input. The PX-150 does have a USB to host, and it can be used with some iPad apps. I would recommend that people buy the PX-350, but I was on a budget. And my PX-150 through these Logitechs sounds better than the PX-350 would through its onboard speakers.

All I can say is that I couldn't be any happier with the piano feel and the piano sound on this keyboard. It sounds just astounding through my $130 speakers. I can only imagine what it would sound like through an expensive sound system.",2
7429,"Bought this for our granddaughters and it has been great. They play piano, guitar and this keyboard.",2
7430,"These work great for what I need them for. They are inexpensive and haven't caused me any problems. If you need them for a working studio or plug and unplug them, or cables into them a lot, then you may want to buy an all metal type. These are fine for my uses.",2
7431,"So out of all the Tube Screamers I've had, this is the first to say ""Maxon"" on the outside. I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90's that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.

The sound has been kind of a blanket statement of ""transparent light to medium drive"". Like any Tube Screamer, this has a great drive on its own, can push an overdriven amp without adding color, and can stack well with other pedals. It's definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.

The pedal I'd compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue. This is definitely the real deal by the company that's been making Tube Screamers longer than anyone else. Definitely one of my favorites along with the Electro-Harmonix East River Drive.

Bottom line; the Maxon OD808 is what a Tube Screamer should sound like.",2
7432,always the best,2
7433,"I love this product. Very, very nice. It is well made. Good job fellows.",2
7434,Still giving me good sound about 4 months in. I'll definitely buy again.,2
7435,Very nice light that adds some flava to my lighting rig. I might buy another one.,2
7436,"For the price, it works!!",2
7437,Good solid ends however the cable tangles up. Just electric tape it in various stops alone the way too stiffen the cable. I mine for the price.,2

The length is just right, I really like these short patches for my board.",2
7439,Great ukulele for the price.,2

I will recommend this to a friend?, Yes.",2
7443,happy to have this grease----it works!,2
7444,"I got these to see how I liked this size, they feel a little light weight for me but they're great stix, I've never received a bad Vic Stick. I'm going to stick with my heavier sticks for rock playing.

Good music to all",2
7445,This is very handy.  Works well & built well.  Filter is made of good old stocking material.  Still the best,2
7446,"I am just learning to play the guitar, and this is a wonderful way to learn. You start by learning strumming techniques. You can then move one key at a time and learn to finger chords. Meanwhile this gets you playing right away.

Sometimes I have to adjust it just right so the chords play correctly. It will not play as well as when  you learn fingering but is is an easy way to learn to play..",2
7447,Great stand and they are getting  hard to find for some reason.,2
7448,"I set out to buy the Blackstar Metal pedal ,but G.C. didn't have one & I waited a month for them to get one. So after researching this Dual Dist. pedal,I decided to ""settle"" for it instead. -  GET Premium shipping or 2 day to avoid this thing being bounced from city to city state to state before it makes it to you.  ....Back to the pedal..  Sems well built & a very simple layout.  Theres a small black button which goes from Clean to basic distortion  which to me seems worthless. It may as well be an On/off button  because....Button 1 is Distortion/bypass & button 2 is  More distortion,for leads etc.  So the black button I don't use. Everything about this pedal I love. It has really good tight tone &  bass mid treble knobs which you can tweak, THEN use the other slf Dial to shape your sound even more .  This dial basically will shape your sound (if looking at an ez)  From the typical V -shaped EQ setting, to an A-shaped setting & everything inbetween. - The ONE thing I Dont like..........is  Since the Levels & the Gain dials are  Stack style  ...meaning big knob with another smaller knob above that.  You have to really memorize which set of Knobs are for what purpose.  Its easy to Think your adjusting the gain,when really your adjusting the Vol level. -  Why?  Because the print on the pedal above the level knobs are just too small & hard to read unless your close to it with the light on.- Thats why i say Memorize which set of knobs are which.  So if your on stage & need a slight vol or distortion tweek, you don't turn the wrong knob. - OTHERWISE  I plan on keeping & using this pedal Regualy every practice & every gig. Because.......it gives me that Tone I like.  Clean,colorful yet Raw and Sounds good. Very distinctive. Id give the pedal overall a 9 on a scale of 1-10 ....only thing stopping it from being killer awesome 10 would be if the stack knobs were easier to read.",2
7449,Needed for my cow bell.  Perfect fit.,2
7450,"what a great little tool for the new player or one expanding their sheet music. I used to hand draw these and mark the finger positions, no more. Love the guitar stamp too. We get music from chordie.com and not all charts are complete so this really helps.
Lots of lessons on YouTube as well. Don't forget to order an ink stamp pad :-)",2
7451,"I bought a used SG that was sporting  NYXL 10-52s. I was immediately hooked. These strings are pricey but in my opinion they are worth it.

Very smooth (easy on the fingers) yet chunky where you need them to be.  I can't use anything else on my SGs.",2
7452,Nice holder instead of the picks all over my guitar case.,2
7453,"This tuner is sleek and small but still pretty sturdy. It fits snug on the headstock without leaving marks
The display is pretty bright and can be flipped so it can be seen properly in any position on any headstock.
Its also incredibly accurate. I ran it while plugged into the Korg Pitchblack Pedal tuner and they both read the same.
I'm very pleased with this product

Easy to use, easy to read, overall a great product",2
7454,Loud and clear sounding!,2
7455,"Bought these because I thought they'd be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when I want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce.  They give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string, and they don't wear down the strings and I actually use them on occasion for my 3/4 steel string acoustic guitar when I want a nice mellow tone.  The only negative is that because of being rubber, they ""stick"" to the strings, so they aren't great for quick strumming, which I wish they were.",2
7456,"I love Gibson strings on my Washburn Electric, there is just something that is vintage sounding with these kinds of strings. I use them for more heavy/rock blues songs on this guitar.",2
7457,"All around great, had better fret-work than my $550 epi les paul and my $300 squier tele deluxe, the sound from this guitar is MASSIVE and i did NOT expect that, the pick ups sound great for my taste (medium gain stuff) and there is barely any more noise than when i use a humbucker based guitar. The finish looks excellent too.",2
7458,Great,2
7459,"Some complain about the quality but this pedal's only flaw is its size. A little bulky for my personal preference. But this pedal rox, thick bassy & not overly distorted to where it starts to sound scratchy",2
7460,"Works a lot better than I would have expected. Hold my ATR2005 right were I put it, doesn't move, has plenty of reach for my application.",2
7461,believe the hype. These are worth every penny on your acoustic guitars,2
7462,its alright,2
7463,Very cheap and does its job well. I was able to rest my acoustic guitar or my strat easily. Setup takes maybe a minute and seems to be fairly sturdy.,2
7464,Not exactly what I had anticipated but does the desired effect just fine.,2
7465,"This amp is great! I plug my guitar into pedals, then into a rackmount 15 band EQ, then this amp. Clean & powerful sound regardless of how clean or distorted I am playing! The fans do make a tiny bit of noise, but you barely notice it, especially once it is in a rack.",2
7466,"The price was most definately the main draw,I am very glad that I placed the order,these people are pleasant to work with!!!!!",2
7467,works good,2
7468,"This Taylor Guitar Stand is gorgeous. The stand is solid wood, and arrives in three pieces. You receive two side pieces, one center piece, and six screws. There is a full-color instruction sheet that shows you were to screw the pieces together.

I purchased the Taylor stand for my Taylor guitar because I had concerns about the plastics and metals used in other (less expensive) guitar stands. I wanted a stand I could be sure would not damage the finish on my Taylor.

The unit is manufactured in Mexico.",2

7471,"You're not going to get an authentic, made in Australia, out of termite hollowed eucalyptus tree, Didgeridoo for $30 bucks... I bought this specifically to learn on, and after I master the whole circular breathing thing, and all that, then, I can justify spending the money it takes to get a real one. ($200+) For the price, this is really nice, and definitely serves my purpose, as a stepping stone. It's been a couple days, and I'm slowly starting to figure out how to make sounds that are getting closer and closer to the actual drone sound... I will definitely have a lot of fun trying to master this.",2
7472,Filled out all my missing major keys with these.,2
7473,"When you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply.  There is no need to purchase a separate Behringer PSU-SB.
Otherwise the time machine works fine, as described.",2

7475,"I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price, I might as well give it a try. This thing works great. There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar. The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board. I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well. Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to, otherwise you'll get some rattling noise from the strings. Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it, it works very fast when you need to change keys.",2
7476,Good drum hardware at low cost.,2
7477,"No noise, flexible, and the design of the plugs are great.  Would buy again, for sure!",2

7481,Sounds grea,2
7482,"What I mean by that is that it has a bit of Muff style fuzz in the distortion mix. It's still more of a overdrive/distortion pedal to me.

This box has a good amount of gain on tap. Folks looking for extreme gain might not like this pedal, but the BALance knob is why I like it. (A compressor pedal might be useful if you want more sustain.) The LEVEL control has a lot of range as well. It has enough output to drive an amp hard, and distort the tone further.

What amazed me is the dynamic sensitivity of the distortion. Even though it is heavily compressed at high gain settings, it's possible to pick softly and notice the volume drop slightly. The volume won't drop much, but that means lower gain settings are usable. The other aspect I favored with this pedal is the low end. BASS can be cranked high, and not get too muddy. I still like it set at about 3:00 as a max setting. With the EQ, BAL and GAIN knobs cranked, the tone reminded me of my Boss Hyper Metal cranked up. This could be a great pedal for anything from blues to old school death metal. It can also be used as a gain or signal booster with the BAL knob set to DRY.

There really isn't much that I dislike about this box. Not even the pedal's purple color bothers me much. Goth heads might dig it just for that, but one can't be too sure... and once again, the bright blue LED is a nice touch.",2
7483,These are the strings I've used for years and will never waiver from!,2
7484,"good delivery, good price, product is as expected,",2
7485,"I've done one gig with these so far and love them. I got them the day before our last gig and put on Remo Pinstripes over Ambassadors on the toms, and used the factory bass drum heads. I ported the front factory head and put in an Evans pillow. I tuned them up with a Tune-bot and took them to the gig without actually being able to play them. The sounded amazing from the driver's seat as well as through the PA. I used my Tama Bubinga snare so I haven't really tried out the snare that came with the kit.

The hardware is the same as Yamaha's top of the line kits, the lacquered finish is impeccable, the bearing edges are smooth, and contrary to other reports the drums arrived well packed and undamaged.

The only drawback to this kit is that the interior of the bass drum hoops are unfinished. I took some wipe-on polyurethane and treated them myself, because I don't want them to pick up stains or get dirty looking due to the oils on my hands from picking up the bass drum by the hoops. I knocked off a star for that since otherwise these are flawless drums.",2
7486,"they are alright, but for a beginner totally. and they are slick so they might fly out of your hand on accident.",2
7487,"The Roland cable is heavier and looks more substantial...and yet it failed on me fairly quickly. This Planet Waves cable, though it seems lighter-duty, is working flawlessly so far, and it's less than half the price of a Roland cable (which are ridiculously expensive).  At the price I paid for the Planet Waves cable I went ahead and spent a few dollars more for an extended warranty since my whole live performance is reliant on running synth sounds from my Boss GP-10.  I'm thinking about buying a spare for a backup just in case.",2

7500,"I""ve been using SKB cases since the early 90s with my first Ovation.  I needed a better case than the ""sack"" Fender gives you with a made in mexico telecaster.  So I went with this.  For the money it not only provides great protection but it also doesn't have the quality control issues that other cases have that are priced the same.  Those seem to have a lot of parts that don't fit well or are in some way poorly crafted.  This case is so simple that its difficult to screw up.  This is NOT a flight case.  Its to toss in the back of your car or in the back of the bar / performance area and avoid someone kicking it or dropping something on it.",2

7502,"It's just about perfect for me, the right length, could be a tad heavier; but it's one of my go-to tippers.
This is mass produced, not a fancy handmade tipper, and while it's fine straight out of the box, I personally super sanded down the ends with 800, 1000 & 1200 grit sandpaper to get an almost teflon smooth feel to the tips.  At less than $10.00, I may buy a couple more just to experiment with brass inserts for weight changes.",2

7510,"I just got this thing and have only learned the basics of looping (I've done two jams so far) but I can already tell it's an amazing tool for any serious guitarist. The reviewer Shawn in PA hit the nail on the head with his comment that he's ""playing guitar twice as much and getting twice as good"" - that's a great compliment on this pedal and I agree 100%.  What I especially like about this pedal is that it feels like it was the ""missing link"" in my collection of gear and brings it all together. I'm using my guitar, my mixer, my bass, my drum machine, my monitors whereas before just doing recording seemed like a bit of a chore - this thing really puts the FUN back in playing.  I think this is the one piece of equipment that will really bring out my creativity and I can't wait to see what I come up with, with my new ""band"" :-)  Update Edit (6/16) I still have this looper and have recently started playing with it again after about 3 years or more of being somewhat side-tracked by iPad music apps. But I've come back to this pedal and discovered a cool way to use iPad apps (such as Garageband) with the Jamman: use the virtual instruments (bass guitar, piano, etc.) in the apps to lay down your initial loop (route a cable from iPad to the Aux-In jack on the Jamman), then layer your authentic guitar riffs on top of the virtual instrument loop you just recorded. Neato!  Otherwise, the only major downside I have with this pedal is having to remember to store the loops before I go to another - I have lost several cool riffs due to this annoying design.  Overall, however, a pretty fun looper and I may move on up to the stereo model, or possibly go with Electro-Harmonix's 720 model next time.",2

7513,"Having played through some of the Pignose's competition, such as the Fender '57 Mini twin, the Mini Marshall, and the Danelectro Honey Tone, I can say that I feel this Pignose is the best in the portable amp category.

You must have fresh batteries installed or use a DC adapter to get the best tone, and while this amp is quite loud for it's size, it doesn't suffer too much tone loss when you turn it down, nor does the speaker flab and fart about when you crank it.  Using single coils will net a nice clean tone, with a nice crunchy Overdrive when cranked.  Humbuckers obviously will drive the amp harder, but I am still able to get great tone with the amp when it screams.

If you're contemplating a portable amp, and want an amp with real tone, rather than an amp with outrageous overdrive, get this amp, don't even bother looking at any other portable amps.  Even the portable Fender amps can't make clean tones like this one.",2
7514,I play hard so light strings rarely hold their tune.  These have stayed in tune for more than a month and still sound clean.,2

However, I have not yet tested it in a gig environment, so I do not know if its output is sufficient to ride over the drum noise and amplified instruments. In any case, it does enable the listener to custom-balance what he or she hears. The construction is adequately robust.  A useful item.

WISH LIST: I wish it had a tone control for the output so that I could better match it to the earbuds I am using. I gave it four stars because I think the designers should have added a tone control.",2

Both my guitar instructor and his boss say they were amazed at how good the sound was from it and were considering getting it for their acoustic. You do have to turn down your midrange on the amp or you'll get a lot of feedback.  A volume control on the guitar would have been nice, but I just run it through a foot pedal with a little reverb and it sounds nice.  Very happy with it, especially considering the price.",2
7524,"If you want a simple looper for practice or live looping this is the best thing on the market. It has exactly that and nothing else, just the ability to make multiple layer loops, then wipe it and make another one. No saved patterns, no drums, nothing fancy.

If you do want the bells and whistles, the ability to save loops and add drums, then go for something more fancy but if you just want to live loop, this is excellent.",2

7549,"I never imagined what difference a set of really good flatwound strings could make, but the flawless slides and reduction of finger noise now has me playing my bass more than double the time I was playing in the past and incorporating much more portamento/slides in my music writing. I have not used flatwound strings on bass until now so I couldn't honestly make a brand comparrison, but if you are still playing on standard roundwound or still experiencing some brushing finger sounds, you really should give these a try.

I've used Earnie Ball strings exclusively for the last 25 years and can say they've always been very reliable, hold their tone well and I know to expect only the best when I buy them. Personally, I'd prefer a lighter, more flexible feel than this particular item (in regard to the custom guage package), but that's just a matter of guage preference and I haven't found a pair of flatwound bass ""lights"" or ""ultra-lights"" just yet. I like that wide range of tremolo you can get easier from lights and ultra-lights, so making the change to this particular guage and firmness takes a little getting used to, for me.",2

This pedal delivers: It takes up only a little space. It's built like a tank. Mine is paired with a Fishman AFX reverb and doesn't add any noise, and the delay is nice.
The only negative is that to change the 9v battery requires unscrewing the entire bottom with a Phillips screwdriver and reassembling it. Thus the pedal is really designed to be used with a external power supply.",2

7558,Gave to a student and she loves it! Parents of student even were very impressed with the quality. Would recommend buying this for any beginner to intermediate student.. this is not a pro violin.,2
7559,"If you need to have in-ear all night in a gig, this is the one for you. This is the only sleeve I have found for my SE that didn't have me dying to pull by the end of the set. I can also keep them in while jumping around, chewing gum and singing!",2
7560,"For a low price capo, you really couldn't ask for more.  The grips on the handle are nice, though not the most comfortable.  I feel like relative to a capo that's twice as expensive, the clamping grip is not as strong as it could be.  The hinge though is strong and it doesn't feel like the product will break soon.",2
7561,This stuff does exactly what it says your strings sound and feel much newer and if you run some along the back of the neck and wipe in your hand really glides up and down the neck  for the price it well worth it. in case you are wonedering like i was no there is no greasy feeling in fact you feel pratically nothing just all feels real smooth and strings sound ligheter and crisper. love it will continue to use.,2

7568,"I haven't had to use this yet, but we keep it on hand at our church for situations where we might need audio from any ""non-professional"" devices.",2
7569,"Very reasonable quality. Sound is excellent and unique. Tremendous value for the price. Yet, two things need improvement though: 1. the pick guard is not sturdy and a bit loose....and if pressed a bit, the nut and screw that secures it to the metal leg, bangs a bit into the guitar top and with time will definitely damage the body. I have to put a tiny rubber disk underneath to prevent damage. (funny, because the guitar really does feel good quality way above Chinese typical standard, but the pick guard is there to remind you where it was produced......). 2. One of the tone control knobs is a bit sluggish and not turning smoothly....(again, China...However this is not entirely Chinese fault, because they will produce in whatever  quality Fender will ask them to, and for the price I'd expect a bit better quality control). However, despite all said above, I still give it 5 stars for it is fun and excellent value for the price.",2
7570,"Very good sound quality. This is not a concert graded instrument but it's not priced like one either. I can hit the high notes and low notes easily and I am no expert. The previous recorder I used was my son's soprano by Angel left over from school class. (does every 4th grader has a recorder ? how many of those gets trashed after the school year ?)
Spent around 30 hours on youtube and following the finger chart the recorder is quickly becoming one of my favorite instrument.
Compliant : the air chamber gets clogged quickly, clearing the chamber is often required, making this an un-reliable instrument for concert. But for self enjoyment it's perfectly fine.",2
7571,These strings are a slightly lighter gauge that any other I have found. This makes them a lot easier to fret. They are very reasonably priced and sound great. I've tried more expensive strings but prefer these. I will purchase these next time I buy mandolin strings.,2
7572,"If you want to self teach yourself to play violin, this is the thing you want.  You have to know where the notes are on the treble cleff staff to use it, but that isn't to hard to learn.

7580,"Size:
I have some very large basses, and this has enough room for any of them. Extra-long scale 6-string with oversized body? No problem. For example, my Cirrus 6 still has about 2 inches of space left. Which also means a short-scale bass will be left swimming.

Construction:
I have another Gator soft case, and this case has about half of the padding but uses denser foam. Exterior is tough cloth (feels like nylon,) and has well-sewed seams. I have always been impressed with how tough Gator's soft cases are. But with two basses in one case, and less padding, this case will probably only be used for light duty.",2
7581,Very nice.,2
7582,My daughter uses it with her violin. She's in middle school. Since it is collapsible it is easy for her to carry in her case. I have the non-collapsible one and I love how secure I feel playing my violin with this shoulder rest. I can move my hand into different positions confidently.,2
7583,"A clarinet reed is highly personal so any reed will have its advocates.  I am impressed by these reeds.  They seem to be quite consistent in the box.  Quality control is good.  The reed is responsive, and I am able to play cleanly without fighting reed induced squeaks.  This reed feels about right for a 3.0 strength reed.  These reeds are definitely worth trying, and I find them to be equivalent in quality to other premium reeds I have tried.",2

Remove the plastic ring that is barely glued to the stock mount, install it as shown and choose the right adapter to screw in from the bottom, it works perfectly and the mic sits perfectly secure, no shaking or wobbling.",2
7589,good product,2
7590,"Very expensive strings compared to everything else I have been using.
A friend of mine suggested these saying how nice they sounded and how long they last so I popped for a set.
Needless to say, I will be buying more for my nice acoustics.  This set is on my Martin and they sound wonderful.  Another thing I like about them is the are so comfortable to play that your fingers don't get sore after a long session from friction.  The coating really helps and does nothing to hurt the tone.
I would highly recommend spending the extra money for these if you play a lot.  My friend plays professionally and changes his once every 10 months compared to every month.
I used to change mine every 3 weeks, these have been on my Martin for 2 months and show No wear or loss of tone.
Great purchase...just wish I could get them cheaper or in multi packs for a discount.",2

7592,"I've seen some big names using this overhead boom on air, and for good reason.  There is generally no need to spend more for an average studio that does not get used 24/7/365.  It ""just works"" - comes with adapters to fit larger 5/8"" mounts, comes with the desktop flush mount as well as the clamp mount, and is big enough to clear most common desktop obstacles.  It's the sweet spot for booms- spend less, get much less - spend more, get a little better quality, maybe.",2

7595,"I wanted a footswitch to be able to turn the overdrive on and off on my Rumble 500 v3. I love the old school look and it's small footprint. The cord is kind of short and it's a little cheap, but it's just a switch, and should last a long time with normal use.
The bottom is just a rubber cap that pops on and off fairly easy. So it can be modified without much trouble. I think I might replace the switch so I can add an LED light.",2
7596,"I've never really found a pair of sticks that really work for me until now.  I bought a small stack of sticks from various brands in different sizes as an experiment.  None of the sticks felt ""bad"" but this was the set that I felt myself reaching for every time.

Like I said, none of the sticks felt wrong.  In fact, all of them felt good.  Vater, and promark make some amazing sticks.  I will say that the Vic Firth's feel more natural (to me).

Another thing I liked is that, even though these are 7A sticks, they feel really stable and absorb a lot of the impact.  Feels great for double strokes and rim shots.  Doesn't feel like I'm wasting any energy on my grip.  Some of the other brands in this size were either a little too lively during double strokes or jarred my wrist a little more with rim shots.  That could just be me though.",2
7597,"Tried this one for the first time, and I loved it. Definitely sounded more vintage than my typical Ernie Ball Regular Slinky Nickel Wound especially on the 3 wound strings (string # 4, 5 and 6). I assume there is no Nickel on the unwounded strings (strings 1, 2 and 3) just stainless steel.",2

7599,"Absolutely love it! Made me a Line6 fan! Tones are great, very flexible and convincing. I have given up on being a rockstar, i got areal job and had a baby, so i am just looking to make convincing tones and have fun. I have tried the app on android and iphone. Honestly the Android app is HORRIBLE compared to the iOS app. I can understand why they released it on iOS only first. When i bought it, there was a promo that gave me a copy of cubase 8 LE for free.  It is very nice, very complicated and took a long time to learn, but very nice. after installing and reinstalling the drivers again, it sounded fantastic, and was way easier to record USB-direct than  with a microphone.

  The bluetooth connectivity is what sets this amp apart. The guitar tone is obviously created by the mobile device, but the streaming ability should not be overlooked! The ability to allow anybody to stream fantastic sounding music is very fun, easy, and a real kick-starter for a fun and creative night. the 30 watt is louder than i will ever need. sounds great for guitar and music. I am thankful everyday that i finally own this amp!",2

7602,"D'Addario nickel wound light gauge electric guitar strings come in a anti-corrosion package. I can attest to the effectiveness of this packaging as I have had these strings in their original unopened package for months. There is no corrosion at all. The strings hold up well(and will hold up even better if you clean your strings of sweat after playing).

Yes, the sound is bright. D'Addario tells you this ON THE PACKAGE. Some people down-rated the strings for this! If you don't like bright sounding guitar strings, the D'Addario website can direct you to their more mellow sounding strings (such as the XL Chromes Flat Wound). There's also a chart on the back of the package that shows you where these strings are on a 'brightness' spectrum.

The 3rd string is unwound-typical of electric guitar strings.

Ends of strings are color coded so you know what string your putting on your guitar (1st string, 2nd string, etc).

Highly recommended.",2
7603,I bought these windscreen to protect my wireless lapel microphone. Works fantastic and the price is unbeatable. I recommend it.,2

7605,"This cloth absorbs so well if you do it how I say: Thread it through the cleaning rod and the cover the top of it with the bigger side. Then stick it into your headjoint and twist a couple of times. Then in one hand, hold THE STICK ONLY, NOT THE CLOTH and in the other hand hold the BOTTOM OF THE HEADJOINT AND THE CLOTH and pull the stick out as far as it will go. Then twist and push it back in while still twisting the stick. You should see less of the cloth and more in the head joint than before. Repeat until you cant see the silk anymore. Then twist a couple of last times and pull it out. Your cork plate should also be dry.",2

7613,"I got this speaker for the sole purpose of using it to play music for wedding ceremonies and cocktail hour when a speaker is needed in a separate location. My main speakers are QSC K12's, enough said there. These Behringer 12 inch speakers pack quite a punch for their size and weight. Speaking of weight,most DJ's know you need light and portable especially for ceremonies and cocktail hour. Another great feature is they have not one but two handles to pick up the speaker. I would not be afraid to use it for a main speaker if I needed to. If you DJ a lot of weddings you can not go wrong with this. I DJ a lot of weddings and at my young age of 49 I'm using my head more and my back less.",2

7616,I've been using these strings for years. I've tried others and I'm just not as impressed as I am with D'Addario strings. I won't use anything else on my guitars!,2
7617,"I was a pretty skeptical about buying a guitar online but after searching through some Guitar Centers and playing a bunch of guitars, I realized I wasn't going to get a better deal than this EG340SC on Amazon.  The guitar showed up brand new and almost a month later still has that new guitar smell.  I've played electrics and acoustics for about 8 years now and this is my first acoustic-electric combo.  I love it.

Before this I was playing a cheap, old Johnson for my acoustic fix.  The Takamine is a great step up.  Extremely playable guitar with a nice loud, clear tone.  The first several hours of this guitar being out of the box was spent by me just playing the biggest, boldest chords I could string together.  Very nice projection and a great sound.  Plus the guitar looks fantastic.  The solid spruce top looks great with the other darker woods on the sides/back, neck, and fretboard.  The one minor problem I've had has been that the cover for the 9V battery does have a tendency to vibrate a bit.  I'm working on a clean/simple fix, probably some felt tape or something to put in there to take out the slight noise that comes with higher-volume playing.  For the price I'm more than willing to work around something small like that.

I've used this guitar for practicing and playing (acoustic), as well as some recording here and there, and it's definitely a solid mid-level guitar, if not better.  This is a guitar that I would have considered if I was looking in the $4-500 range so it's definitely a steal on Amazon.",2
7618,Great picks. They do not slip at all. Medium picks are good for allowing not lead and Rythmn playing.,2

7624,"I love D'Addario strings, however, this particular set when installed on my 28.625"" scale 8-string - the top .74 string was not wound far enough to reach the nut. This left me with roughly 1/3"" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.",2
7625,"The new strings sound very good, although the tension to get them in tune seems a lot tighter then other strings I've used. This just seems to take more finger pressure to hold a good voice.",2
7626,"Great all around pick for electric guitar ( for me, anyway ) but I often use it on acoustic. Feels good, the grip is right, the string pull is good, the action is darn near perfect.....and yes, the ONLY gripe I've ever had about these is the ink smudging like crazy - like others have said..... otherwise, would be 5 PLUS stars",2
7627,good quality,2
7628,"its a capo, it works",2
7629,"Durable, works perfectly, balances the instrument well, folds down small. A good stand to have. The only thing I don't care for much is the black and yellow color combination. Looks like something Stryper would use. Not that I'm anti-Stryper.. I used to listen to them quite a bit, but the black and yellow doesn't really do it for me. Otherwise though.. Yeah, very good stand.",2
7630,I love this tuner. It is more precise than my old one. Buy this tuner you won`t be disapointed!,2
7631,Got this for small gigs and jam nights in place of carrying 100 foot  So far so good,2
7632,"PROS: This thing stays in tune. I love it. It's a great little axe. Came with spare strings and bridge.

CONS: The rosin is small, crumbly, and insubstantial. I recommend getting another one. The bow arrives with broken hairs, which (in my case) looked like it could have been avoided had it been packaged better (without the knob that holds the bow in place going through the hairs). The finish is not as it appears in the pictures, which depict a black semigloss. It's more like that sparkly paint that some drums have.

Despite numerous cons this is a recommended buy. The bow is still OK (might replace it down the line), and I happen to like the non-depicted finish. Most importantly, it stays in tune.",2
7633,Very nice cord. The length is just right and the ends are not lose. Most cheap cords have the plugs get lose or fall out. This is not cheaply made at all. I use this cord for both my bass and guitar. No complaints here. I would most definitely buy again,2
7634,It would be better if noched.,2
7635,Powers many devices.,2
7636,works great...all of those fake credit cards that come in the mail make great picks...i think i would prefer the pick a tiny bit bigger but these work ok,2
7637,"This thing does exactly what I needed it to do. The phantom power on my MOTU 828 died, rendering the mic pres on it non-unusable. When this first happened, I started worrying that it might be my expensive condenser mic but considering the age of my 828, I shifted my attentions to it. Without really knowing if it was indeed the 828 that was causing the trouble, I decided to go ahead and roll with the Nady and it worked exactly as hoped/expected. It simply adds the missing phantom power that is needed to drive a condenser microphone. There is no added coloration, hum or anything else that would interfere with your signal path. I'm very pleased.",2
7638,These are exactly as described/pictured and work perfectly.,2
7639,"Solid auto wag pedal. Simple to use and has a quality sound to it. I use it sparingly, but it is reliable and capable of giving you that wah sound without taking up a ton of space on your pedal board.",2
7640,"When you need a no-nonsense leather strap that is not long, consider this. If you need something fancy, or want to sling your guitar low, or if you are a tall person, probably you want to skip this.
I'm 5ft 8"" and I'm already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin, and it's not like I'm trying to hold my guitar particularly low. If you are a tall person, or if you want to mimic Jimmy Page's posture or something, this is not for you.
Apart from that, I have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive (it's more so if I believe the ""made in Canada"" sticker on it). Hard to beat it as far as leather straps go. At 2.5 inches wide, it's comfortable, one-ply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough, and the looks of it is not that bad either. Sure, there should be nicer/better product, but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks.
The only complaint I have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap. Though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some  elbow grease, it would have been nice if I was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar.",2
7641,"I bought this several years ago when they were still $159. Worth every penny.

Shortly after that, i took a voice over class and they recommended this mic and a pop filter for creating voice over demos. (I never did the voice over stuff but learned a couple things in the class.)

It is super simple to use, convenient to plug in...the quality is good for recordings. You can use this for voice overs, vocals in a studio environment, even instruments at moderate levels. It's not meant for putting in front of a loud instrument amplifier however. (nor is any condeser mic). I do use it in front of a guitar amp at low levels if I am practicing or noodling and just want to capture what I'm doing.

Great USB mic and now that it's $98....even better. If you don't own one...get one.",2
7642,"works great - sweeteners are a bit funky and really don't use them - but tried. Good idea anyhow. Use it for open tuned resonators, banjo, mando, violin, viola and upright bass - good tuner. Like that it is mountable - hook it to a mic stand with an extension arm - can see from a relative distance - don't forget to charge it though...",2
7643,Nice pick,2
7644,"They're standard picks. Nothing special and nothing wrong with them. They'll wear out over time like most pics. The images will fade (quickly in my case).

If you're playing a 60's themed gig, these are cool to throw out to the crowd.",2

Well built and sturdy.  However, with all the cables plugged it due to it's light weight, it wouldn't stay put.  Sandbags maybe?  :)  I'd buy again.",2
7648,They look and perform quite admirably and precisely !,2
7649,I bought these mostly for the aesthetic value. Not sure I notice much of a difference in sound quality but they look top notch.,2
7650,"These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand.  They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp.  I'm using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later.  The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a set.

If you do stereo recording, you can't go wrong with these - their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear.  It sounds great, and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away, rain drops comming down, and sounds you never would hear.

Note:  NEVER get these wet - you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain.

You will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar, but you already know that.",2

7653,"I have tried MANY brands of guitar strings in the last 20 years, and so far GHS Electric Guitar Strings are the one I continue to use.

7656,"I used this for a while with my pedal board, at the very end of the chain to quiet noisy pedals, but the noise I was getting wasn't that significant, so I took it out of the chain and put in a box of other gear, mothballed, in essence.
However, I've been practicing recently with a drum machine (Zoom 223). This is a good machine, though it takes some getting used to, but it is EXTREMELY noisy, though it quiets down a bit after being on for a couple of minutes. I was just about ready to chuck it and try a different drum machine. But, I remembered my Noise Reducer Pedal, sitting on mothballs and got it out and plugged it in between the drum machine and amp. I had tried plugging the drums into both my amp and my PA, but the amp had better tone for me, plus being easier to blend with my guitar, plugged into the same amp.
The effect was MARVELOUS. The noise was instantly reduced from annoying to the point of madness, to a very quiet hiss, barely noticeable, and again, after a couple of minutes, even that goes down. I don't know if this is a defect in my drum machine or just inherent noise, but the Noise Reducer certainly fixes it, and I can plug it into the regular power supply for my pedal board. A terrific save.
I don't exactly understand the controls, but I just adjusted the Threshold until the maximum effect was achieved, and the decay I set to the midpoint.",2

7665,"Every year for the holidays I sync lights on my house to music and I am always looking for more lights to add. I had the chance to test out this MARQ lighting Rezotube pack and overall it's a really cool design. The tubes are all independent and come with multiple mounting options, you can use the fan shapped mount included which is fully adjustable or you can stand them individually or even hang them on the wall if you wanted to. They connect together via fairly short cords so they have to be within a foot or two of one another which makes sense because of the pattern they put out. The tubes themselves are VERY flimsy plastic and if you aren't careful you will easily crack one, at least that is what it seems. I would have liked them to be a stronger plastic that didn't feel so cheap and fragile given the price point. But they do work. The lights also come with a carrying case and everything fits inside nicely, as long as the case isn't dropped or shifted upside down everything will remain fine, but in the case the tubes sit at the very top in slots that are cut out for them, then you close the flap and zip it up, this means the tubes are directly next to the top flap, there is a piece of foam that covers it but it's not that sturdy so if something heavy were to hit the bag chances of you damaging the tubes is very high.

The lights put off a number of different pre-programmed patterns. I have a 4 month old and last night we played with this and she was in a trance by it. There are several what I call shooting star patterns that she just loved and the speed, clarity and color of these is pretty astonishing. There is also a sound activated mode which I had a little trouble making sense of as the lights seemed to do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted even in silence. The more I played with it though the more I was able to control and understand how they worked.

At the end of the day these aren't cheap, $449 at the time of writing this which means each tube is worth $89, plus the controller, cables and stand they through in. It does have the DMX controller inputs as well so if you have other lighting this can play along with it, or in my case a light-o-rama setup with DMX.

They are a lot of fun, Would I recommend? I would say it's a toss up. You have to be very careful with them so you don't break them, but they really do put off a nice show just using one of the 30 pre-programmed displays and if you need that attention yes it's a good option but it certainly isn't for everyone.",2

7667,"I have the red version of this guitar.
This is a good little guitar, especially for what it is, very portable. It has a nice neck and fretboard, but the hardware is a little on the cheap side. The pickup is high output and it's great for rock, but a little rough for the clean stuff. It's pretty bright, especially for a humbucking guitar, but I suspect it's because there's not a whole lot of body there. As such, it takes a little getting used to in order to play it comfortably, but I play it sitting and standing with a rough leather strap and it works just fine. If you can't play this guitar, maybe this isn't your best hobby.
Now, right out of the box it was horribly set up. I spent 20 - 30 minutes adjusting the bridge down and adjusting the truss rod. When I was done, it now plays great.
The one thing I changed was the pickup, I swapped it for a Seymour Duncan Invader. That gave it a little more 'oomph', but the stock one is adequate for all kinds of higher gain stuff, I'm just an old metalhead.
Overall, it's a good travel guitar as well as just a decent guitar, but be prepared to do a full setup. The bag is good and it should travel as well as the Ministar it's replacing.",2
7668,"Wife wants to play guitar again after a long hiatus.  My full sized Takamine with fat strings is too big and heavy for her.  Got her this 3/4 Yamaha and I fell in love with it. I may have to get another one for her because I've been hogging it.  It has a great voice for a 3/4.  The action is nice, the built in tuner is a real treat. Never had one before but it is unbelievably convenient.  I don't plug it in often but I had to check out that sound too.  The electronics sound decent.  Can't crank it up too loud or it starts to feedback, but I'm actually sitting right on top of my small but punchy VOX amp so I can't really say how it would work for playing out.  The reviews convinced me to buy this one.  The best review only had one major complaint; the tuning pegs.  I agree they could be better, but I don't think they are awful.  I have to tweak the tuning just a little once or twice a day before I play, but it isn't like it goes out of tune when I'm playing, even when I'm beating on it hard.  I think it is well worth the price and was surprised by the volume it produces.  Much better than expected.  If you don't find the tuning pegs worthy, I think the instrument is good enough to spend money on for an upgrade, but I don't plan to.  It is solid, light weight, comfortable, nice sounding, well designed, feature rich and handy. I'm keeping it in the corner by the bed and I pick it up every chance I get.  I haven't played guitar much the past few years so having a guitar at my fingertips all the time is helping me get my callouses back quickly.  No matter what you play, if you lose your callouses, rebuilding them is always painful for a few weeks, but this instrument is pretty easy to play.  I've gone through the process several times over the years with my Takamine.  This is far less painful.  Perhaps that means it will take longer, but at least I can still use my fingers to type long reviews in the meantime.  No avoiding the pain regardless of what you play, but there is pain, and there is agony.  This guitar hits a sweet spot somewhere in between. It's just right for young or old, big or small. (FWIW, I heard an interview with Clapton where he confessed he doesn't play much when he's not working and when he has to prepare for a tour, even he has to go through the callous building process).  Well, I'm way off topic now.  Again, great little guitar.  Go for it.",2
7669,This is a nice product.  I did not have to make any adjustments.  Bought two screws at Ace and it installed in minutes.  Only issue I have is that I guess I ordered two!  So now I have one that I don't need.,2
7670,If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) you need this and the 1 spot adapter. It will save you a lot of money on batteries and aggravation when you battery runs out on stage.

I go through one of those a year because I do twenty or more of those gigs a month. The normal failure point on the Beato bag is around the seams. The cordura starts to wear in areas and I have to change bags. I always hoped that Beato would put the hi-hat/spare head compartment on their Pro Tolex series, which is much better built.

This bag is almost like having a Beato Pro Tolex series with the spare compartment. I think Beato's Pro series is better made, but this one is close and priced about the same as the cordura offering. Plus the plush lining of both the snare drum and hi-hats/head compartments on this model are superior (and the snare drum compartment is a closer fit.)

Seams on this are heavy duty, the handles are reinforced with rivets, and the zippers are about the same as both of the Beato models I cited above. Moreover, the carrying strap is vastly superior to the Beato models in my opinion. They are definitely more comfortable on my shoulders.

Given that this is priced close to the lower end of the Beato snare bag line, and has features that the higher end (and much more expensive) Beato bags do not, I gave this five solid stars.",2
7688,"Well, I've been using a Peterson ""Virtual"" Strobe tuner for some years, and it has been good.  But the Turbo Tuner just outclasses it in every way.

Turbo Tuner picks up the notes faster, especially for bass guitar.  Seriously, I'd have to turn up my volume and boost the bass knob sometimes to get a tuner to track my bass.  With the Peterson (a VS-1) I'd have to turn it on in ""bass mode,"" and still it took a bit to track lower notes, *especially* the low B on my 5-string.

This Turbo Tuner just needs a slight touch on the string - even low B.  Bam, it grabs the note and shows it right now.  Seriously, I can just lightly tap on my B string and this tuner grabs it.  It's super fast, and it's very very accurate.  I can even see the effect of slight temperature changes in my strings, or from lightly pulling my headstock back - the slight change in pitch shows up instantly on the display.

But the strobe display means it isn't fidgety - for all that accuracy, it's still very easy and fast to get the string right on the money.

This one is a real strobe tuner, not just a strobe-like display like my Peterson.  This actually uses the incoming signal from your instrument to run the display, which is part of why it is so fast.

Best tuner I've used.  Absolutely worth every penny.",2

7697,"This mixer is meant to be a stereo mixer giving you two channels, LEFT and RIGHT.
If you use this mixer's AUX output you can have three independent channels to record with. If you use ""half"" of the inserts on channels 1+2 you may get a total of five independent outputs. This is pushing the limits of the mixer to the max.

If you want to record more than one stereo track or two tracks using channels panned LEFT and RIGHT, you will need a special audio card or interface that will allow you to do so. Usually if you want to record an entire band live and separate the tracks for mixing/mixdown you will need a special audio card to allow for more than one stereo input. Most times they are 8-16 channels, and also function as a soundcard.

If you want to multi-track record more than two channels using THIS mixer, you will need to install the Cubase software (included) or something similar like Cakewalk Producer, etc.

To record:
Read all manuals for equipment and software.
Set up a recording project in your software.
Arm the first two tracks or arm one stereo track.
If you use two tracks, you will need to set one track to record the MAIN LEFT and one track to record the MAIN RIGHT outputs. You could have a vocal mic panned to the LEFT and a guitar channel panned to the RIGHT, thus giving you two independent mono tracks at once.
Record the first stereo track. (or two mono tracks)
To overdub and add other parts to your recording, UNARM the tracks you just recorded and ARM a new separate track to record.
When you record the next track, you should hear the the tracks you recorded previously and add to them on a separate track, isolating them.
Keep recording tracks until you are finished with your project. You should expect to get maybe 20 tracks (or more) depending on your computer's specs and the limitation of the software.
Adjust all the levels to your liking adding FX and EQ and export your mix to a Stereo WAV file or MP3.

Here is a typical home studio routine:
Program a drum machine. Hook it up to your mixer. Record the first stereo track drums only.
Hook up a bass guitar and record the bass part on a separate track while listening to the previously recorded drum track. Do this for your guitar, keyboard, vocals, harmony vocals, lead solo, etc., tracks until finished.
You ""build"" the song or project one part at a time until finished.
Mix it down to stereo audio file.",2
7698,"Please also see my review of the Suzuki Promaster Low F.

Received my Promaster in key of A last night and it is
 remarkable.  Being a higher key than the Low F, it also
has a brighter, sweeter sound. As usual, Amazon provided
excellent delivery service and,  as always, the finest products.
 My next key will be b flat.
  I can't help but repeat myself:  This is a wonderful
 instrument. You have to play it yourself to appreciate it.
  It is very expressive in its dynamic range, because it bends
  easily and lends itself to playing chords very nicely.
  I have played many harps so it only took me 20 minutes to
 realize the bright output of this harp. It requires just
 a bit more control of breath to maintain the mellow quality
 of the tone, easily learned.
 Mr. Suzuki has dedicated himself to really refine his instruments
 to the point where they are truly the best they can be.
  Again, I thank Mr. Suzuki for this Promaster in the wonderful key of A",2

7708,"After DOD pedals were absorbed into the DigiTech brand name, I always felt like the HardWire pedal series was a direct response to the reputation of DOD pedals as cheap, unreliable effects for bedroom players.  The HardWire pedals came with a very sturdy ""BOSS-style"" soft switch, and solid metal enclosure with a wide, low, and stable profile, and bells and whistles like Mod switches and metal knobs.  In short, pedals like the Valve Distortion and Tube Overdrive were boutique-caliber pedals at BOSS prices, and you could argue that the RV-7 Stereo Reverb was one of the better pedals they ever made.  As of early 2015, it still seems unclear if DigiTech has formally abandoned the HardWire line in favor of new products, but the RV-7 is a pedal that should stand the test of time.

There are a lot of quality reverb pedals nowadays that can cover a variety of reverb styles - including the Boss RV-5 and the TC Electronics Hall of Fame.  Those are excellent pedals, too, but the RV-7 really does a nice job covering everything from vintage spring reverbs, to the subtlety of a room effect reverb, to the lush, deep effects of a hall reverb.  And each of these settings actually seems to range from the very subtle to the over-the-top, which is where many reverb pedals fall short.

But what really sets the RV-7 apart in this price range is that the 7 reverb modes are supported by Lexicon algorithms.  Lexicon may be unknown to many casual guitarists, but they are a legendary name in the development of digital reverb and effects.  The rack-mounted equivalents of these effects cost thousands of dollars in the 80's, and even now are usually in a much larger form factor costing hundreds of dollars.  This is true-to-life ambient sound effects in the size of a stompbox, and sold for $150 or less.  Amazing.  I don't know that this is the ""best"" spring reverb I've heard in a pedal (the Catalinbread Topanga deserves some mention), but it's a very good one in a pedal that does 6 other things.  The Lexicon-supported Room and Hall settings are terrific, as is the Plate setting for a bright, 70's-like finish to your muted riffs.  The Reverse, Gated, and Modulated settings along the top are a bit more niche, but all done extremely well.  I truly believe this is the last Reverb pedal I will ever need, and that's not something a pedal addict can usually say with much confidence!

A few caveats to point out - the pedal has a hookup for a 9V battery, but it's basically decorative in a high-powered digital reverb pedal like this one.  (By the way, if you were ever stumped how to access the battery compartment on a DigiTech pedal, as I stupidly was for awhile, the hinges on the footstomp portion double as release pins to kick off the cover - press inward with guitar plugs on both sides!)  You will get zero battery life with the amount of power this demands, so you will want a good power adapter.  The One Spot adapter puts out 1700mA, which is plenty of power, but some digital pedals run in parallel have issues with digital pedals.  If this is an ongoing issue, an isolated power source like the one from Voodoo Labs should do the trick.

Whether or not these pedals are discontinued, they are still being stocked online and in many stores.  I think it's an excellent pedal with hundreds of dollars of value compressed into a compact pedal, and at a reasonable price.",2

7720,"I first picked up an inexpensive Lanikai LU-11 soprano uke from a new local music store, thinking it might be fun for both my 5yo son and I to give ukulele a try.  Well, that uke had such unacceptably poor intonation that it was painful to listen to; no matter how carefully I tuned the open strings, as soon as I fretted a chord I could hear the fretted strings were VERY sharp in pitch, making the instrument unplayable/unlistenable IMO.  Thankfully, the store owner allowed me to trade up to an Oscar Schmidt OU2 concert uke.  Wow, what a dramatic improvement, for relatively little difference in price!  While the intonation isn't absolutely perfect --and I've learned this is unfortunately endemic to most ukuleles-- it is surprisingly good for such an inexpensive instrument.  In fact, I had also purchased a more expensive Cordoba 20CM solid-top concert ukulele that had slightly worse intonation than the half-the-price OU2.  Moreover, the depth of the OU2 affords it suprisingly decent projection for an all-laminate uke.  In fact, after having the OU2 restrung with Aquila strings (since the stock strings leave something to be desired), it sounded so close to the shallower but solid-top Cordoba 20CM that I exchanged the Cordoba for a significantly nicer, larger, and more expensive all-solid Moku Select Series MS-90TC tenor cutaway acoustic-electric ukulele for myself.  My 5yo son remains the proud owner of the OU2.  It's a great size for him, sounds pretty good, is less susceptible to humidity changes than any instrument with a solid top, back, and/or sides, and it costs relatively little (should he accidentally damage it), making it a great starter/student uke.  Does it compare favorably to my Moku Select?  No, absolutely not.  But it would be completely unreasonable to expect it to, given the huge price differential.  Lastly, I should note that (at least after re-stringing it) it does suffer from a little bit of fret buzz, unfortunately; so it's not perfect, but I still recommend it.",2

7722,"This stand folds into a pretty small package, but supports the guitar very solidly. You would almost have to INTENTIONALLY knock it over, I don't think a casual bump would do it.

I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge, D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green, the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory), the high E is silver, and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great, but the first few times, it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.

D'Addario is my favorite string, hands down, after almost 40 years of playing.",2

It holds tuning very well and stands up to rigorous practice and gig use. Sounds very nice amplified. Pretty wood with lovely satin finish. It will be my instrument of choice when playing with the Ukulele Klub of Eau Claire (WI).",2
7741,works great,2
7742,"For the price, this is one heck of a bass.  The pickups sound decent, it arrived with good intonation, and the action was pretty good right out of the box.

Please note, as a short-scale bass, this neck is shorter than a standard bass.  I am primarily a six-string guitar player, but wanted a bass for recording demos and the occasional jam session.  The shorter neck feels much more comfortable to me.

Pros:
-Comfortable, affordable, and fun to play.
-Cool aesthetics.
-Sounds good plugged in.
-Satin finish on the neck is very thin, smooth, and fast.  This makes it easy to play.  I have honestly played on $500+ instruments with necks that weren't this nice.

Cons:
-The finish on mine isn't perfect.  This is a very minor gripe, especially considering the price.
-The hardware is poorly plated.  The tuning machines seem like the chrome plating will peel off quickly.  Again, not that big of a deal at this price range.
-I'm having trouble finding a gig-bag that this fits into nicely.  Guitar gig-bags are too short, and standard bass gig-bags are too long.

What are you waiting for? Buy this bass! Whether it's your first stringed instrument, or you're a guitarist looking for a bass to have around, you'll have trouble finding a better bass for your money anywhere else.",2

7746,"Great all around speaker.  Shaped as a monitor so stacking is out.  One handle is enough, but odd.  These speakers are incredibly loud and clear.  I use them outside on an ocean front stage and they throw an incredible distance clear and clean.  They are lightweight and durable and produce solid bass.  Did I mention that they are loud!  Great speaker and addition as mains for small venue concerts.

1 YEAR OUT*******
I was looking for maximum bang for my buck.  Being the father of a prodigy child performer I have had to learn from trial and error.  After a bunch of research, I purchased a pair of these to use as mains that I wouldn't simply out grow in a year or two.  As she grows and the numbers in her crowd grows, I can simply add to the system knowing that ultimately these will be used as monitors.  There are many pro's to these speakers, but a con or two as well. Since my daughter is a vocalist that uses backing tracks, these speakers don't really produce the full highs that is needed so I paired them with Mackie Thump 12's.  So far this combination has been extremely versatile and produces more than enough bass, mid and high end to accommodate crowds up around 200+  outside, ocean front and at Rock concert levels out to around 175-200 feet.  You can clearly hear the performance out to at least 3 blocks. It all fits into my pickup and takes about 20 minutes to get everything set up, tuned in and running.  It is all being run thru a Behringer Xair Mixer that I cannot boast enough about , in ear monitors, wired and wireless mics (Depending on the genre) and a common power scrubber.
For larger concerts, fortunately most of the time pro audio companies handle the sound and use line array systems, but we can give them a run for their money when we add her EV mains and subs to this small, but competent system.

7755,"The D'Addario Micro Tuner is a very simple device. When I received it, I was very surprised at exactly how ""micro"" it was (it's not much larger than a roll of quarters). The tuner was a little fidgetty getting onto my viola, but afterwards it was very simple to operate. Despite being such a tiny package, the display is very easy to read.",2
7756,Great product. I can now relax while playing my acoustic bass. I love how it stores flat.,2
7757,"This is a great product for the price! it gets a bit wobbly when the boom is fully extended, but after-all it is light-weight and fully collapsible so there is not much to counterbalance the weight of a mic. Additionally, if you swing the boom, the gip that extends the main pole commonly comes loose. As far as the functionality as a stationary/upright mic stand, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and for the price you can't ask for much more.",2

The included screws were too small for pickup.
No noise or hum. This was used on a new build.

7773,"I got this today (Wednesday) and I ordered it on Sunday so it came really quick and I was happy to get it. It was packed alright, but nothing was broken or seemed like it easily could have been.

Pros:
It holds my mic. Thats what it is intended to do.

It extends pretty far and is able to be set next to my keyboard and have my mic held in the middle of it in order to sing into it.

Cons:
It came in two pieces that had to be screwed together at the middle and it came apart twice while I was trying to extend the boom. would have been a big deal if I had actually dropped my mic.

Like some other people said, it does tip over. Now I have a MLX 990, which is no small mic, but this still shouldnt happen. This is surprisngly enough just a minor inconvenience because as long as you position one of the legs in the direction you are pointing the boom it holds fine and doesnt even threaten to tip. That's not the stand fault, its physics. You extend something far out and put weight on it when it has no way of supporting itself, its going to fall. Not a big deal, its actually common sense.

I like it so far and would probably recommend it

7776,"good, stock replacement.",2
7777,"This is fairly priced, holds the harmonica pretty tight and isn't uncomfortable at all.  The issue I have with it is that I'm a singer and as assembled it is too tall for me to use with a vocals mic - in other words, my mouth can't get clear of the harp to sing.  I have a pretty long neck too.  However, I took it apart and flipped the neck piece over  like another reviewer suggested.  That lowered the harp a couple of inches, making it the perfect height for the way I use it.  I'm not sure if that's a bug or a feature, but it works out perfectly.",2
7778,"Very durable. It's a bit heavy, but about what I expected. Really like it.",2
7779,Plug and play. Works exactly how it should. Simply connect to a USB port and then connect  XLR cord(s) to your mixer and turn up the volume.  I love that I have the choice to run mono to the mixer so I do not have to dedicate 2 channels for a stereo mix if I really do not need stereo effects. So much easier and cheaper than anything else I've found to connect a computer to an analog mixer that does not have a USB input option.,2
7780,"I selected this amp after reading many reviews on similar, portable practice amps with all of their attributes.  It was a hard choice, as there are around 4, or 5 amps that fit what I was looking for.  What really sold me on this amp, the Vox Mini 5 Rhythm, was the build quality reported by other reviewers, the hours of playing time on battery power, 5W 6.5 inch speaker, and most importantly, the multi-rhythm play-along beats you can select and adjust volume, and tempo, independent of the guitar amp volume.
I am a late entry beginner to guitar (meaning over age 50), and am thoroughly enjoying learning guitar, both acoustic and now, electric. I do have one acoustic/electric guitar which I plugged into the, Vox Mini 5 Rhythm, just to see what it would sound like, and it is usable, though this amp really isn't designed for that.  So, get a separate acoustic guitar amp if that is what you play the most.
I would highly recommend the, Vox Mini 5, to anyone looking for this category of portable amps.  Though the choices are very close.",2
7781,"The addition of the chorus effect adds a new twist and makes for a much warmer flange sound. Has a nice wide sweep. Personally, I'm a big fan of the newer more condensed E-H effects - fits a lot better on a pedal board. They're still a touch expensive, but still much cheaper than the boutique stuff.",2

It is small, portable, and sounds absolutely amazing.  I am reviewing the CS model, which has the older 70s electric piano type of sounds, plus a multitude of analog style effects.  See my video review for a quick demo (longer than intended, but at least you can see some of the basic operation).

PROS
- Very portable (can run on AA batteries, and has small built-in speakers)
- Plenty of jacks / connectivity (USB / MIDI / line outs / headphones out / etc)
- Cool analog style controls
- Incredible smooth analog sound (despite being digital under the hood)

CONS
- Retail price isn't cheap; for the same money, you can get a much more powerful device (but that is like saying you shouldn't buy a motorcycle unless you have a car; apples and oranges kinda thing)
- Some controls when changed in real-time do not seem to work properly (changing the rate on the phaser, for example)

In summary, this is a really fun little keyboard if you are looking for the type of sounds it can deliver (which are somewhat limited).  Make no mistake, the sounds are spectacularly clean.  It is rare to find a portable keyboard with speakers that can deliver studio-quality sound, but just realize that the capabilities are limited.",2

7793,"These capos surprised me.  Craftsmanship is very good, and they seem plenty rugged, but when I first saw them I was positive they wouldn't work; the arm that clamps on the strings is straight, not curved like a steel-string guitar fretboard.  But, before writing a negative review (which I dislike doing), I tried them on a couple of guitars.  To my amazement, they work as well as capos I paid a lot more for!  I'm glad I bought them!

7809,"Usually when folks learn flatpicking guitar they graduate up to thicker picks. Which I did. Lately though
I noticed that the thinner picks gave a ""brighter"" sound that I preferred. So I am back to thin .46 picks. I hold them
so the round edge faces the strings rather than the pointed part of the pick...this stiffens the approach to the strings. The only downside to using
a really thin pick is the fact that they wear out quickly. So buy them by the 6 x dozen.",2

I as others changed the strings to my own preference of elixir nanoweb extra lights however the guitar had epiphone strings which worked very well.

As an aside, I've had a Alesis machine that is 8 years old.. stayed on most of the time and is still working but showing signs of ""old age"" however it still works but the volume is down and I have to yank up the recording volume for recording...

I play bass with acoustic instruments and need to keep the bass soft in the mix.  But there are parts where putting up the volume is really nice to be able to do.  I've been doing it with my hand on the knob on my bass, but its hard to get it back and forth where I want it.  With this pedal I can set minimum and maximum and do it with my foot and get a swell on the way to max.  It's also great that you can adjust gain as well as volume.

7844,"I may be biased in my review as I've used another brand of strap locks for quite a number of years.  These are good, and very comparable to the Dunlop locks I've used, but a few differences make the two types pretty even.  I like the button on these better, as it's easier to use, and still secure.  The way these attach to your strap, is very basic and I can see it possibly working itself loose, causring the strap to ride along the lock.  For that reason, I gave 4stars, because, I think they could have come up with a better solution to attach the strap to the lock.  Overall, I don't expect any failure of the lock, so I would recommend these.",2

Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing.  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release.  It was worth the wait.  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music.  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing.  Operation is simple- press once to record.  Press again and it begins playback.  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer.  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub.  Tap twice to stop play of the loop.  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing.  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click.  It is very responsive to pressure.  There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop.  Nicely done, Digitech ;)",2

7849,"These mics produce an amazing quality of sound when optimal positioning is selected.  The wide frequency pick up range and fidelity are VERY impressive in these condensers in my experience.  When used with TASCAM DR-44WL they perform remarkably well and truthfully on grand piano recordings.  In a flat gain setting across all the microphones engaged one could argue they tend to slightly emphasize the highs over the lows, and with just a minor increase in gain of the mic oriented toward the lower registers of the piano this emphasis is virtually eliminated.  When run in parallel with the DR-44's own mics the mix down produces an unexpectedly high quality of recordings.",2
7850,"This thing drastically changes the tonal spectrum of your guitar. It makes single picked notes more articulate and chords more shimmery and full. This thing on its own adds a lot of very deep bass to the overall tone. I was going back and forth when I first installed it, liking it and not liking it. I had brand new strings on my guitar and it was making them sound overly bright. Now that they're worked in a little more the tone is balancing out.",2

In the review video I show the tuner in detail, including how to use it to tune an instrument.

While I liked that the display can close, preventing the tuner from being turned on accidentally in a gear bag, and that the display swivels, allowing for flexible viewing angles, I thought the display itself could have been better. In particular:

1. The display is constantly flickering, which is annoying.

2. The font used for the notes looks like from a 1980s calculator -- a more readable font could have been chosen.

3. The use of red/green colors is a poor choice from a user-interface standpoint, especially since so many people are red/green colorblind.

All three of these points together -- a strobing, flickering, red/green color-changing calculator font -- leaves a display that is not as readable as it could have been.

7867,"Keep in mind that I am an advanced beginner ukulele player, not by any stretch an expert!

The Cordoba 20CM ukulele is not flashy; no fancy bindings, high gloss finish, or elaborate inlays.  It is, however, a very well made instrument.  The neck is constructed of a single piece of wood (unlike some cheaper instruments which are pieced together).  Fit and finish are very good; no extraneous glue, nice tight joints, even finish across the body and neck.

Most importantly, it sounds quite nice and plays easily.  I earlier owned a laminated concert uke that I thought sounded too bright and tinny.  The Cordoba has a nice mellow tone, good sustain, and reasonable volume (I actually like that its not real loud, sounds more refined to me).  It came set up very nicely, easy action on the fretboard and almost in tune.  It stays in tune remarkably well for a new instrument.  My only complaint (a small one) is that the open geared tuners seem a bit fiddly -- they feel loose somehow, and don't seem to tighten/loosen the strings smoothly.  Instead nothing seems to happen as I slowly turn the peg, then the tone suddenly jumps up or down.  Its not a big deal and I think it may just be me gaining familiarity with the uke.  I also have a Gretsch tenor uke, and tuning it just feels different.  I love the Gretsch, but after only a couple of days the Cordoba is threatening to replace it as my instrument of choice.

Bottom line:  very good value ukulele.  Sounds sweet and plays easily.  Well made and well finished.",2

I already had highly rated surge protectors, but that's only step one.  If you have high powered amps (especially sensitive tube amps) and/or electronic equipment, this will help reduce miscellaneous unwanted background noise and give you a clean, pure signal.  The high end surge protection is a bonus!  After confirming that it made a difference I could hear on my tube guitar amps, I bought a second one for my digital console and powered monitors, and again noticed an improvement in sound quality, especially on the high end of the drum kit. It's real!",2
7870,Perfect!,2
7871,"Unless you want to spend a lot more, this is the best mic stand in this price range. No issues, it's basically the industry standard. Very happy purchaser.",2
7872,"Small problems power supply* we are getting new power supplies READ BELOW FOR DETAILS** so far so good we use it for family home and it works really good.

1. after finding a good channel we have good sound we have not yet to here any break up sounds clear. (INDOORS HOUSE)
2. range works around home ok so far.
3. easy to use just plug in and play. we like the balance connections to all connections.
4. we like the no cables work great for us.
5. wish the price was a little less.

we will update this review later after we use it a bit more!

We just ordered a 2nd unit, 1st one works good in home (*we had small problem and worked it out) and we want 2 separate channels so 2 boxes are needed.

our family likes the product and we find that we had to change the channel several times.

A) Important ***we did get break up noise on some channels and it picked up some signals making it break up form time to time.
B) we changed channels many times and found a channel that was clear and our home has clean sound.
C) we have two units and at first we throw every thing together leaving pile of wires and we had some signal problems, so we carefully separated all the wires and used electric tape just to make sure all cables were neat and clean of each other and we founds clean channels and we have clean sound.
D) running more then one so we made a clean wiring to mixing broad and separated the two Alto's apart couple of inches form each other.
E) one of the plugs hums a little nothing to do with the alto unit, just squeezing the power supply stops the humming. so for now we used a metal clip to squeeze the power plug to stop humming. then play music you can not here the humming unless you are in the studio recording quit time. we will do an exchange later for power different power adapters.
F) Over all we like the unit and will continue to use the product we have clean wireless sound in our home and we had to make a few lets says wire clean up don't be sloppy with wiring and all is good so far.

Note: we are using all balanced connections xlr ((receiver to transfer box out box xlr to mixer or Alto))

will update later if any thing else happens. Above is what we found to work best for our home and this product

just got off the phone with Alto spoke to John Detora so ***problem we are having the power supply only ***** the power supply makes a loud pitch noise and creaking sounds, 3 of the power supply plug do this. After talking to Alto they would like to see a video of this we will try to make this all happen.

****important we paid pretty good penny for this product and we my have to buy radio shack power supplies because these are defective or something. We tried other power plugs and no sounds come out when plugged in.

so far the wireless is working good other than the above problems.

we can file out this foam sent by Alto to get replacement power supplies or just go to radio shack what to do?
here is the foam they sent me so if you need help you will have to do this to.

just wanted everyone to know what we found when buying this product. we will update you later?

we ordered 4 AC Converter Adapter DC 12V 300mA Power Supply Charger US DC 5.5mm x 2.1mm 0.3A hopefully they will not buzz. the power supplies that come with the alto sale on Ebay for under 3 dollars form china.

Note* we are not filling out the foam above for the company to send us the same cheap power supplies so we have bought new ones that are foam a supply in china that also sells the same power supply used by Alto so we have upgrade the power supply to a better unit.

THE BUZZING IS REALLY ANNOYING WHEN WATCHING TV WITH LOW VOLUME OR AT NIGHT WHEN IT IS QUIT.

will let you know once they come in and we test them.

we tested all the power supplies that came with the Alto and each one makes noise some louder than others sounds like popping cracking burning electrical **we will try to do a video so all can hear the sound and you can plug it into any outlet even filtered clean power still makes sound. we have other electronics and the power adapter makes no noise.

so waiting for new ones to come in.

they come in and work great no humming nothing quite.

****note the back of the units say 500ma or 500am look on back of units then look at the plugs that came with alto 300 not 500, this may or may not mean anything but we match the power supply for 500 not 300 (were going to do 300) all works great so far.

maybe the 300 is just a little low on power Vs the 500 power supplies, 500 is on the back of every Alto unit not 300.

we have had it on for an hour testing the new power supplies and all works clear so far.**quite clean and nice sound so far.

found this on web about the 300 Vs 500 **if a unit needs 500 you can not use 300 you can use 500 if the unit uses 300 bottom line.

for example a source 12v and capable of 500mA
and a product rated as 12v and 300mA

doesn't it mean the resistance of the product is r = v/i = 12v/300mA

so when connected to the source(12v) it will automatically draws i = v(source)/r(product) = 12v /(12v/300mA)= 300mA and wouldn't draw 500mA

after replacing the bad power supplies and running the system for a while we have no issues after fixing the above stuff.

*** using the upgraded 12v 500 power supply we have so far no cracking and all channels so far are better than before and the power supplies are clean with 100% SILENT and power supply meets the spec for the units.

we will be keepin go wireless it was a pain in the rear but done hope this help others

end note: we own several units and all power supplies that came with all units made noise and we replaced all power supplies everything works great for us. ** we did keep all the original power supplies form Alto just in case any questions to the old power supplies that made really bad noise then plugged in.

we like the wireless it is running 100% great and hope to see Alto fix the power supplies.

most playing if you are a DJ or other and listen to the system loud many may not even notice the noise coming form the power supplies. we use them in a studio setting and things get quit so hope this helps others

we believe this is a good product works great around home and studio setting. it may be help full if Alto added adjustable frequency (channel and frequency controls) to the channels like some mic receivers so you can turn out/fine tune and little issues.

thanks for the product Alto despite the small problems.",2
7873,"Thick, sturdy, neatly stitched.  I cut the Levy's logo off with a snippers since if I want a logo on there I will do my own.",2

7877,"These are good mid weight boom stands. They work well and seem well made. Not as beefy as my Pearl or Tama hardware, but great for the price. They were an excellent deal-",2

7879,"Great, the perfect size for what I needed them for.",2
7880,"While this metronome/tuner is a bit more expensive than others, it is really a nice unit: the tuner needle doesn't wave all around like with some tuners (if you have one, you know what I mean) and it responds quickly enough that I can sing and see the notes I'm singing-and how much I'm off, unfortunately.:>}  I like the metronome because it flashes and I can see it while I'm playing in band (I put the metro on my music stand)-I've been watching the needle-type only timers and they are fine, but the light keeps me honest.  The adjustable back light is great to see the display in subdued lighting or if you are a bit farther away from the unit.  I haven't fiddled around with the ""beat"" feature-I'm almost always in 4/4, so I can't comment on that.",2
7881,"If you want to add this sound to your arsenal of percussion but don't know if you want to spend the money on the ones you've seen in Guitar Center.  This is a great option.

7886,"Can beat it for the price. i wouldn't quite call it ""pro"" equipment, however it is a great compact kit if you hook a kick trigger and a hihat controller up to it (sustain pedal works as well if you are on a budget). Good sounds on board but I run it through my mac via USB and use kits from GarageBand for my recordings. Only had a week so I will update if I run across any issues. Great job KAT!",2
7887,Great sound!,2
7888,My favorite brand of strings for both acoustic and electric. They're always the best price here on Amazon so it's a no brainer.  Rock on!,2
7889,They just look so cool!,2
7890,"After a long investigation I chose this as my ""chorus"" because it is very customizable. I'm glad I got it. It's the only chorus I know that actually sounds pretty to my ear. True, it's actually a unique pedal on its own, but it covers the modulation thing well. It gives you a random kind of weirdness that I love. You would be mistaken not to try it out. And as a flanger it may not be completely versatile, but it does a very appealing version of that effect too.",2
7891,Awesone,2
7892,Great for a Telecaster.,2
7893,"great balance, feel, weight and they have been holding up well.  perfect for my drum practice pad and edrum kit",2
7894,"I've always like Hosa cables for their balance of affordability and quality. These don't stray from that approach, although I'd have happily paid another dollar for some strain relief at the place where the cables enter the 1/4"" jacks.  A little tug while working behind a crowded rack could easily pull a connection loose.  Aside from that, it's a good snake and the inclusion of European-theaded lugs is much appreciated.",2
7895,Sturdy stand. Good for my acoustic or my electric. For the price you won't find any better. Nice and compact for travel. Very light weight but still durable. I've had it for a few months now and it is still in great shape.,2
7896,"I have tons of rack gear. These help as the washers are already in place. Put you Isolation washers on the back side and these up front and you're good to go. I tend to move a lot of Mic-Pre's and channel strips in and out of my racks and have not had one of these mess up a threaded rack mount, as in I have not had to go back after removing one and chase the threads back out with a tap...",2
7897,"Extremely accurate, visual reference better than their cheaper model, which works great anyway. Both highly recommended, although for a little more worth getting the Super Tight.",2
7898,"This is not a top-end case, but it's a good case at a good price. I needed a budget priced case for occasional use and this one is working fine so far. There are some minor flaws; panels not lining up exact and such, but nothing that is a problem for me. If it holds up I will be very pleased with my purchase.",2
7899,I ordered these for my son for his birthday. He loves them! Good quality. Nice color.,2

7904,Good strings.,2
7905,"Great strings.  D'Addario makes some of the best.  I use them on all my guitars.  These are no exception.  My only beef with them is that they seem to take days before you can get all the stretch out of them and  stay in tune.  On a 12 string, that's a big consideration.",2
7906,"Surprisingly good for a pickup/mic under $10 dollars.  It does need a lot of eq to get the low end where it should be, and I had to use an active DI box with it, but it sounds great on both violin and cello",2
7907,"These are kind of shaped like the Fender cellulose picks but are tougher.  Nice grip.  I think I prefer the shape of the Tortex though.  These Peaveys are a little clunky in my hand because they are slightly bigger, though I could probably get used to it.

The printing is very high quality and has a 3D-like quality to it.  If I were collecting them and not using them to play guitar I would be very pleased.",2
7908,"I wanted not to like these.  Coated strings on a Martin is frowned upon in certain circles.  But when it comes down to it, I love these strings on my Martin 000-15.  Firstly, it saves me a truckload on strings.  I was having to change uncoated strings about once a month, and even that was too long depending on how much recording/playing I was doing.  Now I get 6 months to a year before I feel it's time to replace them.  I also get a more consistent sound while recording from day to day.  Uncoated strings change from ultra-bright when they first are put on, then they hit a sweet spot, then they die off and get dull and lifeless.  The Elixirs pretty much just hit the sweet spot immediately and stay that way for months.",2
7909,"Regal Tip is the best. Quality construction, lightweight, yet solid feel. I've had them for 3 years and they're by far best brushes I've ever played.",2
7910,"VERY useful. Despite having to 'slide' on the edges of the stand, they don't leave scratch marks. They're very durable, and as a result, they make the stands quite heavy/bulky. Otherwise, they are excellent.",2
7911,"As I'm learning... the right tube is dependent upon the equipment and user preference.  I tried these tubes in my phono preamp and in my stereo amp.  In both cases they were too warm sounding for my tastes.  Keep in mind that my goal is a deep clear soundstage and there are better tubes that work in my equipment.  They are better than the Shuguang tubes that came with my equipment, but similar sounding.  For now, I've settled on Tung-Sol in the preamp and winged =C= in the phono preamp.  It's all a matter of personal preference and I took one point off just because it didn't work for me.",2
7912,"Very well made. Good zippers. Fits my Epiphone PR-150, which is a bit longer than some acoustic guitars.",2
7913,use these as specific use cloths...1 for buffing off Gibson Guitar Spray Cleaner after it dries 90%.  Another dedicated to buffing off Gerlitz #1 Guitar wax after appropriate drying time.  Well pleased with these cloths,2
7914,"Excellent to attach strap to neck of acoustic guitar AND provide quick disconnect, as well.",2
7915,The Kyser Quick change clamped harder than necessary and made tuning necessary every time I used it and took it off. A friend recommended the Shubb and I no longer have any tuning issues due to it's adjusting screw.,2
7916,"I don't know if they are the best (haven't tried them all), but from what I've tried, none are better. D'Addarios are top quality, and very reasonably priced. My choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics.",2
7917,"After a year and half of using FenderTexas Specials in my Jimmie Vaughan maple fretboard Stratocaster, I decided they were just too ""harsh"" sounding for my tastes. I carefully selected three Dimarzio pickups as their replacement. I got this 58' for the neck, a True Velvet for the middle, and a 61' for the bridge. My number two guitar is now my number one guitar. I LOVE the way it sounds now. This bridge pickup sounds really warm and natural. It has a very full, warm, natural sound. Not muddled. Still able to hear notes ring out. I'm also finding out it is awesome at when I play softer, it is softer. When I really go at it, it picks up there too. So it covers a good range for me. The tone of this as well as the full set is a ""vintage-y"" type tone. Like some of the tones I hear on old blues records. I would even say it compares to SRV clean tone, without the ""hotness,"" which probably came from his Tube Screamer pedal. I love this pickup as well as the other two Dimarzio in combination. Really worth a shot if you're like me and looking for a vintage traditional Strat type sound. Highly suggested!",2
7918,very useful and durable,2
7919,"I'm 52, and play bass. This little pedal works great. Easy to see. Bright screen. Green, your on. Mutes my chain when I engage it. Only I know when using it. Makes it easy to check in tune between songs if needed. Very sturdy little box. Smaller than I expected. This is my second Donner pedal. The other is the Metric Bender. Amazon delivered it on time to my front door. Far better than other pedals costing way more.",2
7920,AAAAAAA++++++++,2
7921,"Brilliant lights, great price ,works on auto and with DMX as advertised. Standard mounting holes, too.

Update: I can't say enough about how nice this light is - covers a huge area, very colorful, many options.

I've received several compliments and comments since putting this in my rig.",2

7923,Excellent strings!! Wont use anything else on my acoustics,2
7924,This replaced an old junky board and I couldn't be happier! The sound is crisp and clear and is very easy to use! I wish that I would've done this years ago!,2
7925,Dry enough!,2
7926,Good,2
7927,"This broke a few weeks ago. I did not take good care of it at all, but that's the users fault. It also does not have enough XLR inputs and outputs, but at the time, I needed something simple, so it worked great at the time",2

7929,What more can you say? Vintage fine from the masters themselves.,2

7932,good,2
7933,"I got these for my modified Ibanez GSR-200 Bass.  Because they were Black, and matched my Black Bass that I use for stage performance.
They were inexpensive enough to take the risk.
I'm impressed.
LOW Backlash!
SMOOTH tuning action!
FIRM feel!
ABUSE resistant!
GREAT for a stage guitar, and not unworkable for studio work.  Quite the bargain!",2
7934,Product was delivered quickly and the cables seem to be good quality,2
7935,Beautiful item. A must buy for Shure SM7B. Allows you to run without maxing the gain knob and getting dirty power hiss. I love it,2
7936,Good instrument... little complain about noises when turning up and down volume and tune (in the guitar),2
7937,"Good upgrade for my Squier Deluxe Strat. Although, note that if your pickguard isn't a Fender made brand, the hole in the pickguard maybe a little small. Not to worry. All I did was took a drill bit the same size as the ""screw"" (where the knob goes on, and drilled the pickguard, thus it fitting. Over all nice purchase.",2
7938,"Came with headphones, cable and stand which it does not show or advertise. Conjunction with amazon points this little baby only cost me 39! Great buy and find. Mic was able to pick up myself and three others while background noise such as squeaky dog toys and barking was not as predominant as our voices. The microphone plus Audacity mean't no loss in recording and no fading of our show!",2
7939,"I love this pedal. Makes my fender amp scream. It will go from 0 to about 1000. I will be buying more joyo pedals. If they all are as good as this, I see having to buy a bigger pedalboard soon.",2
7940,"I looked at a number of different recorders and this one met my needs. I use it for an interface to garage band for podcasting and recording music. I also got the accessory kit so I can power it off USB.  The battery life is good and as a portable recorder it is awesome. It really has 4 inputs taht are effective without spending extra cash to use the other 2, but so far 4 has been enough for me. Such a great little recorder.",2
7941,"This is a Strong Reliable capo, holds up to many years of abuse. I recommend to any guitar player!",2
7942,Fantastic.  So easy to use and so much fun.,2
7943,Love this pick. Good quality and great tone!,2
7944,"I use three of these to help mic my drum kit.  I mount them low onto cymbal stands (to reduce vibration from hitting the cymbals) and they hold the mics in place well.  Used them only at a few gigs and use them set-up during practice so the jury is out still on longevity but I think if I'm gentle with them, the little soft end of the screw should keep working for a while.",2
7945,Good gadget,2
7946,Plenty of room for pedals and nice touch is the mounting option for a power brick.  Cord easily tuck away underneath..,2
7947,"This little gem filled its intended purpose perfectly. I play harp (harmonica) at local open mic/jam sessions with friends. Mostly it's classic rock, southern rock, blues and some country. I used to play through the ""house"" PA, but found that to be restrictive in some ways, so I bought a small, 20W instrument amp to have a little more control over my sound. Well the little amp has difficulty keeping up with the more powerful guitar amps without driving it too hard (leading to distortion/muffled sound quality).. I didn't want to go with a bigger, more powerful amp, because I don't want to have to lug around big, heavy equipment, so I thought I'd try this pre-amp to keep from pushing the main amp too hard.

I haven't tried it ""live"" as yet, but I did test it at home. Without the pre-amp, I had the main amp volume set to 8-9, and the three EQ setting equally high. The poor 8"" speaker was definitely not happy. Once I plugged this pre-amp in between the mic and the amp, all that changed. With the pre-amp gain control set to almost the minimum setting, and the ""output"" (volume level) set to the 9 o'clock position, I get more sound out of the main amp with it's settings at 5 than I did with just the main amp set to 8-9, and the sound is SO much cleaner. I am dying to experiment with the gain setting to see what kind control over the overdrive I can get.

The fact that this unit will take either XLR (balanced) or 1/4"" TS (unbalanced), or a combination of the two, is a real bonus. The other controls are all very useful, especially the 20dB mute and the 48V phantom power. Not features expected from a device at this price point. The old school knobs allow instant tactile feedback in a dark venue, and the unit puts out very low noise unless the gain is turned way up. One other cool feature - the LED signal level meter doubles as a tube-warmup countdown timer...the LED's progressively extinguish (R to L) until they're all off. At that point, the tube is presumably warmed up. Nice feature, given the absence of an on/off switch.

I did open up the unit to see how easy/difficult tube changes would be, and was impressed by the build quality and design. I'm an electronics tech by profession, so I'm very critical of those things, and this unit is made well, period. I didn't notice any tendency for the power plug to come loose. There is a cheap plastic clip adjacent to the port, to retain the power cord, but it is virtually useless - the ONLY criticism I can make of the entire unit. As a bonus, it is compact enough to fit into my small canvas bag, along with mics, cables, and my harp case.

I look forward to many enjoyable sessions with this little device.",2
7948,Love these strings!,2
7949,Easy to use and accurate response,2
7950,Was very happy with my purchase!!!!,2
7951,works best with double humbuck pickups,2
7952,These work great. I like a thin pick but they move around a lot. The grips really do help keep the pick put!,2
7953,"Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.",2
7954,IT seems tough enough. We will see. I had another bag of this brand the zipper broke the first time I pulled it.,2
7955,"So, like I said, its not bad but its not great. For the price i think its 5/5 stars. but I will rate this fairly and give my honest opinion. I bought this so I could have one and not have to worry about having to hook up a mic or anything to my 5 string banjo externally. I wasn't expecting to do any real live performances with it. But a few days ago, I did a song with my friends (I will wait, Mumfordnsons) for my school and I wasn't too impressed with the quality of he sound. I have a washburn B-14 and i love the natural tone of it. but unfortunately, this pickup kind of loses a litte bit of that natural tone. It doesnt sound great but its still not bad. as far as reliability goes, I haven't had a problem with it and i don't expect to because its fairly simple. For the price its great but over all i give it four starts just because the quality of the sound isn't quite what I expected, although I wasn't sure what to expect with this.
Overall, I would recomend this to someone who maybe wants to do a gig or two and then not really do much after that, if you play like every week or maybe for your church, like I might be soon, you should invest in something better",2
7956,Quality product. Thanks!,2
7957,"love it , work great.",2
7958,"A good piano INVITES expression. It has a way of galvanizing you and drawing expression out of you.

Sadly (but expectedly), this artistic ""je ne said quois"" has always for me been lacking in digital keyboards. I used to have a Yamaha P80 (circa 1999 or so). There was a certain acceptable kind of expressive quality to it, but never anything like a real piano.

The Yamaha YPG-635 (same as DGX-630, which is the ""mass market"" yet identical version...they do this to not anger music stores by using a faint ""implication"" that 635 is somehow better than 630, but it is not: it is exactly the same) takes another step in walking ""halfway"" to that point...in other words, I think keyboards are going to continue to walk halfway to the finish line of realism...i.e. will continue to get close, but perhaps never truly make it.

This one gets closer. Still has not ""arrived"" yet at that soul-blossoming place where even just one press of one key is supple, lithe and living...or where playing one note just naturally leads to playing another, addiction-style. This does a great job of getting a lot closer to that point, though. There is some soul and breath in this thing...at the end of the day, it is still a robot, but they are doing a great job of starting to better fool us simple humans as technologies advance.

The piano is beautiful. None of it is real wood (above the keys is moulded plastic ""wood"" and the stand is simply veneered particle board), but matches perfectly and very much fools the eye and makes a striking and lovely impression, even sitting right at it.

In all, I paid more for my P-80 ten years or so ago, and all told would much rather be playing this. I have no need to cart this thing around, so the slightly reduced mobility (not much reduction, though) is a non-issue for me.

Enjoy!

p.s. this works GREAT with Logic Pro 9 and GarageBand. Just get the Mac OSX MIDI driver from the Yamaha website, install, et voila! You are playing the gorgeous synths in Logic Pro with gusto and a high level of dynamic attacks and expression most cheapie ""plunker"" keyboards you may have been using will generally not give. It's a unique experience!",2
7959,"I love this product.  this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings.  No need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters.  For a modest rig, or on the road use, I recommend this product.",2
7960,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-2 Overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues....  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is "" It tends to be a little noisey ""  if you turn the gain up too much.  You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have.  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great...",2

You will also need a 3 prong cord adapter if your wall plug-ins can't accommodate 3 prong cords.

The On/Off button is at the back. The fuse is also on the back in case you ever need to replace it. There is also a frequency button and intelligent degree button.

The directions state to turn the intelligent degree button clockwise all the way to increase the sound sensitivity. No matter what I tried or which way I turned either knob I could not get this to work along with the music. it just stayed at whatever setting I set it to.

Even though I couldn't get this to work along with the music the colors are still beautiful. The housing is metal and does not look or feel cheaply made. The handle is very sturdy allowing you to hang this anywhere. If you choose to hang it up be aware that the cord is not very long so make sure you have an extension cord available.

Depending on where you place it this light will throw beautiful swirling colors of light across the walls, floors, or even the ceiling. The moonflower pattern is so pretty, this would be a wonderful addition to any party or get together!",2
7962,"What can I say, I am a string snob! Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played.

I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference. The guitar has such a great ring to it.

Also use these on my Taylors. These will give any quitar a beautiful voice!

This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee.

A little texture on the inside of the picks might help them to stay on better. I roughed mine up with a file so that they stay put.",2
7986,I got this microphone for my home recording studio. It is a great microphone. When I record I Often use more than 1 microphone to create a stereo effect and in case 1 microphone fails then at least the other has the backup.

Update 2/2017:  Though I don't travel that much with my ukes (twice a month max), I'm finding this is still suiting my needs.  I currently use it for the Recording King banjolele instead of the Caramel, mostly because the RK travels more often.  It's a loose fit for the RK - I can leave the tuner attached on the top of the headstock - but not so loose as to cause any problems.  Since the RK is a lot sturdier than the regular ukes this will likely become it's bag instead of the Cordoba bag.",2

I got these heads about two months ago and they're still strong. The sound is amazing.. The first time I put them on, I fell in love with the sound. It gives you that nice deep sound on the toms and bass and a nice pop for the snare. These are my first heads after the regular stock heads my set brought (4-Piece Sound Percussion Drum set), I can't really say they are the BEST heads out there simply because I haven't tried any other heads. But I am 100% satisfied with these heads. They get the job done. Well recommended!",2

8017,First off I own Sperzel and Schaller locking tuner equiped guitars and these Grovers are every bit as good. These were direct drop-in replacements for the original Grover rotomatics that came on my Gretsch (FMIC era) G6120BK. They tune a bit easier than the originals most likely due to the improved 18:1 ratio. As others have mentioned the tuning post height is much less than the originals but that's to be expected since you won't be putting more than half a wrap on the post. They look fantastic too! To my eyes these Grover Locking Rotomatics look classier than the Sperzels on my other guitars.,2

8020,really like this stand.  holds any guitar well and securely.  lightweight and stores easy.,2
8021,I bought my daughter a ukulele that came with a similar tuner. I kept borrowing it for my acoustic guitar. Decided to buy one rather than incur her wrath. I contemplated more expensive units but bought this. I am not dissapointed. Works as it should. Good value for the money.,2
8022,"I searched for an All-Tube combo amp for under $500 and got 20 different amps.  Almost all of them were rated from 5 to 20 watts except for a 50 watt Peavey Valveking, 30 watt Crate V Series and the Bugera V55 combo.  I play mostly Blues & Jazz with a sprinkling of classic rock.  With the music style already defined, it was down to the Crate & the Bugera, both being voiced in the ""vintage"" class as in 60's or 70's sound.  I chose the Bugera, being 55 watts, you get more clean headroom.
I wasn't disappointed.  The clean channel sounds warm & chimey with my single coil Strat, full & bold with my humbucker equipped Ibanez.  I get to play the Bugera more than my Fender Hot Rod DeVille 410 (that says a lot).  As with any other amp in this price range, the dirt or gain channel is not that great.  You're better off putting an overdrive pedal in front of it.  This amp takes effects pedals well.  I use 2 OD pedals & 1 distortion pedal to switch back & forth to get my desired effect.  If you're into ""metal"" or hi-gain shredding, this amp is NOT for you.  A good feature is the ""triode mode"", where it cuts the power in half.  In this mode, you can crank the amp to get that sweet tube break-up sound!  I can't do that on my DeVille without the neighbors knocking on my door.  Yes, you can easily get this sound from a 5 watt tube amp, but for the same price, I'd rather have something that will be loud enough to play with a drummer.  If you only play in the bedroom, consider the V22 or other lower watt amp.  But if you also play in bigger venues, I would recommend the Bugera V55.  Good warm, sparkling cleans, decent reverb and mates well with your pedals.

4 Years Later.......The amp is still going strong.  I replaced the tubes sometime ago and the sound improved a lot.  The dirt channel is now very playable.  I put the gain knob on 4 or 5 and boost it with my Barber Direct Drive or HAO Rust Booster and it always put a smile on my face.  During that time span, my Fender Deville conked out, my Egnater Tweaker 15 keeps blowing fuses, and my Vox developed an annoying hiss!  Only my Traynor YCV-40 has kept up with the Bugera V55.  I'm seriously considering the new Bugera V22 Infinium if I have the extra cash.",2
8023,"The Orange Tiny Terror is a switchable 7/15 watt amp.  It is a head only with no reverb or effects.  No effects loop is present in this head.  Controls are Volume, Tone, Gain only.  There are three outputs for different speakers of different resistance.
You may find the lack of controls a positive thing or a negative thing depending on how much control you would like.  Controlling the output tone can be challenging to get set sweet (especially if playing several guitars and switching during a set).  An easy fix would be to get an EQ pedal, I personally do not find it too difficult to turn the tone knob.  If you are a put it and leave it person, you might actually find that fewer controls are better for you.

It is easy to push this tube into power amp overdrive, especially in the 7 watt setting.  I didn't have any problems eclipsing 100 decibels at 10 feet with a 16 ohm 2x12 cabinet *(with the stock tubes).

Here is the only downfall with this amp.  Mine came stock with tubes labeled 12AX7B china, and EL-84 China.  These tubes are gainy and gritty.  The pre-amp distortion with these tubes is fizzy and grainy.  A simple tube replacement took this amp and made it much more pleasant to the ear.  I used JJ tubes and replaced the whole set.  While replacing, I first did the pre-amp tubes and fired it up.  The amp was clearly better following this change, with the elimination of the fizziness of the China 12AX7B stock tubes.  Replacing the power tubes was the icing on the cake tone wise.  As far as the technical skill required replacing tubes, simply remove the 10 screws holding the top and gently pull the tubes.  Align the new tube pins and gently work the new tube in.  Make sure the amp is off and unplugged during a tube change.

This is a one trick pony.  This is a one channel amp.  Dont expect super clean cleans and harsh overdrives.  This does what it does, and does it really well.  I am slightly disappointed in the poor selection for stock tubes with this amp.  Some do ship with adequate tubes and some do not.  Orange would do themselves well to put higher grade tubes in this amp and pass the cost on to the consumer.

Overall rating 4 out of 5 stars.",2

I have used D'Addarrio strings for well over 20 years. A light gauge set is more often used by a rock & roller (which is not me). However, I can tell you that, for me, D'Addario are the best, most consistent quality strings made. I have tried many brands, including pricey Austrian imports, but keep coming back to D'Addarrios. They make dozens of different gauges & styles. Probably the best selling guitar string in the world...for a reason. Nuff said?",2
8031,Got a new Taylor 150e for duet gigs.  Needed a good quality capo.  Very happy with this one.,2
8032,Just what I needed to complete my new pedalboard.  I have increasing respect for and trust in Donner products.  I look around and realize I now have a whole bunch of stuff from them that I use every day.  Nice to find a brand that delivers the goods without breaking the bank.,2
8033,My son loves it and says it works great. Impressive for the price.,2
8034,The Audio Spectrum DJM618 Professional XLR Gooseneck Microphone is a great addition to my new mobile DJ Set-up. I recently designed a completely portable and modern dJ booth and the slim contemporary style of this microphone fits right in. The audio is very clear and the construction quality excellent. Great value compared to other more expensive brands of similar style mics.,2
8035,"This made it through the floods of Houston completely undamaged - packed nice and tight. Bonus points for shipping! My first ESP or LTD experience. I usually play Fender strats & have had schecters and ibanez.. I'm really impressed even though it's a cheaper model! Guitar came set up properly & with a set of .09 gauge strings on it. The fine tuners on the Floyd Rose aren't exactly as smooth as I want them to be and I'll have to look into that later. Biggest complaint, I think theres only 2 trem springs..I'd probably add another in there so the tremolo is not so easily manipulated however you'd have to reset the whole guitar up, but that's okay cause I don't want flimsy .09 gauge strings anyway.. Now the action on the guitar is set a bit low but I haven't found any dead frets or buzzing on any strings. Neck is thin but not too wide, very nice to play. I go through a fender superchamp tube amp and on the clean channel the guitars pickups already start to break up without any major volume, so their already hot pickups, I'd say they're pretty balanced tone wise. They can squeal out some good harmonics easily. I get a lot of feedback which can be fun if you're playing metal and this things sounds great with the distortion/OD channel or pedal kicked on. Not bad stock pickups although cleans sounds aren't as good but you can deff upgrade later however if you want some tone changes. The guitar is darker than the stock photo and the flame finish probably is only superficial but it's a great looking guitar. Floyd rose tremolos if you've never had one, they're not as simple and the guitar has to be properly set up and balanced. If you change string gauges or drastic tuning changes it can be frustrating if you don't know what you're doing. Once set its stayed in tune just great. Overall this guitar plays nice, sounds great for metal mostly..but can play anything really. The shipping was safe and it's a just a great value for the price.",2
8036,My son loves these reeds for his oboe.  He's also trying the medium soft since that one seems to be a best seller.  Love that it's almost half the price of our local music stores.,2

8040,"Works as it should with my VibroChamp.  Could be a little heavier to stay in place better, but still worth 5 stars.",2
8041,Beautiful chorus effect with my Ibanez Artcore.,2
8042,"The Ernie Ball Expression Series Ambient Delay SCREAMS quality.  The build quality is absolutely stellar.  Check out the size of the expression pedal pivot in the pictures.  I can't say I'm a fan of the copper color finish, but that's trivial.  The expression pedal itself is dead smooth.  The knobs are dead smooth with just the right amount of friction to keep them from moving.  No noise.  No artifacts.

The effects themselves are excellent.  Good reverb with a good range of effective room/stage sizes.  Good delay.  But the real benefit is controlling the mix with the expression pedal.  Dial it back to sink back into the mix.  Hit it for full effect.  I will say I'm more of a fan for this for the delay than reverb, but if you really are sinking back into the mix, going dry with the reverb is less of an issue than with the delay.

No bypass.  Basically you're on the pedal's buffer with the pedal back.  Not a problem for me, but I don't have a board with a zillion pedals, either.  The pedal can use tap tempo, but doesn't have a tap switch - the expression pedal presumably prevents that, so if you want it, you'll have to use a separate switch ... pretty much essential for live use.

Packaging could be better (see pic).  No damage to the pedal itself, though.  I've also included a pic of the ""documentation"" - a simple, small fold-out.  Nothing more needed, really.

Excellent pedal and excellent concept.",2
8043,"This will be a very short review. My usual off the rack strings would be(and still are)this companies Jazz/Rock set with an .11 to a .49 with the unwound third. The very idea that they offer half set gauges shows they want to please. As far as I know, nobody else does this. Stores don't usually stock them as these are for a very small group of players, so I bought ten sets online. Try them if you feel the need. Again, the fact that these exist is crazy cool. They also have a .9 1/2 set for you guys who want a lighter set with the same advantages. I don't even know if many guitarist know these even exist. I put a set on my Gibson Explorer and they feel really nice. Just a little more tension all across the board(pun).",2

8058,"This is my most recent guitar purchase and it's now the seventh (including my bass) in my current small collection . I've been playing for years. I wanted a Strat with a humbucker and I can't afford an American Strat. I bought this guitar with the intention of gradually changing out any inferior hardware and, over time, I'd have another really nice guitar. I may still do that - it remains to be seen. But this review is directed more to the new or intermediate guitarist. It amazes me that a guitar this inexpensive can sound and play as well as this Squire does! I have a Fender Strat that cost a LOT more (purchased in financially better days) and this guitar's playability and tone are mighty close in comparison. No, it doesn't have the Fender name on the headstock. If that matters to you, you're probably not reading Squire reviews anyway. But to summarize my feelings on the guitar: Would I gig with it? In a HEARTBEAT! And I can buy SEVEN MORE of these before I spend the equivalent amount of ONE American Strat.",2

8061,"Just right for my build. Put it on a 250k push/pull pot. Pull for single coil, push for humbucker. Single coil sounds like a tele should, humbucker mode will melt your face off . Ive used DiMarzio pickups in many guitars over the years and they are always quality.",2
8062,"The functionality of this pedal is unquestionable, however it doesn't seem solid and I think it misses key features, esp for a digital pedal. The on/off switch almost came off with grease all over it. I tightened it and now it's ok. For now. It feels plastic and cheap, I hope they improve that. Their pedals have consistent look, which goes off the beaten path for guitar pedals design, so kinda kudos, but then I think it compromises durability. These knobs don't look and feel built to last, that's for sure.

I really think it should have a sweepable capability.

The presets feature is awesome. I've made presets for different pickups and I don't have to think about it, just step on it and go.

Eventually I took it out from my pedalboard as it was getting too heavy to carry around, but I haven't sold it as I think it's a powerful sonic tool that I'd like to use in the rare occasions when I get ""creative"".",2

8071,I put this on my fender sunburst stratocaster and it made my guitar pop. It fit in very well and I have no issues with putting it on. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to install. It changed the whole appearance of my guitar. I would recommend it to anyone.,2

The reason they are thin, is they have to fit Under The Strings up above the nut. Also, as noted, if you have a strap with strings on the headstock end, this product will not work. Most guitar straps have button holes on the headstock end, which is what Martin designed this for.  If you don't want to put a pin in the neck/heel of your guitar like most people do - or prefer to have your strap attached to the headstock for some other reason - this is the best way I've seen to do that.",2

8097,"I have great confidence in this product, but with speakers in a cabinet, it is very hard to tell the difference between what you had before and after unless you had some real crappy speaker before hand. Swapping speakers takes more than enough time for you to forget what it sounded like unless you record it or something. I think with most speakers it is a placebo or ""emperor's new clothes"" experience: because you want it to sound better, it magically does. So all you have to go on is the advice of Amazon reviews. I have never blown an eminence speaker while I have blown many Peavey speakers. They sound good, and they hold up. Like pickups in a guitar, the body and other factors such as cabinet, crossover, amp, and instrument have way more impact on the sound than just the speaker. Just make sure you get the right ohm rating. Also, take a picture of or label where the leads going to the speaker terminals were connected to save a headache.",2
8098,Great sound,2
8099,"Is this a professional interface? No. Is it good for creating a crystal clear acoustic album? No. There is a slight hiss on it that is not overbearing like other reviewers said, but just enough to turn me off from wanting to record anything serious on it.  I've tried everything to get around it, and i'm using professional grade cables and microphones, but even when the laptop is unplugged from power, and i'm nowhere near anything electrical, I can't get around the hiss. But if you're doing a high energy song with a lot of noise, then chances are you won't even notice it, just use a noise gate for whenever you aren't playing. That being said, this is perfect for getting your ideas down.  I've come up with so many songs that I forget the next day, and using this I can wake up at three in the morning, start up my music software (FL Studio), and record whatevers in my mind so I don't forget it. And as a bonus, this comes with its own software for doing just that, though i've never bothered using it. Despite the hiss, its a good solid beginner interface that you can use to get ideas down and do some amateur recording with, as well as throw in your backpack without worrying about it breaking.

One last thing, it doesn't supply phantom power.  So if you're planning on using a good condenser microphone, you'll have to go with something else.",2

Roll the gain back and push the volume to get hit your pre-amp harder, or do the opposite for warm, bluesy OD at unity levels. The EQ knobs are very functional, helping you get fatter riffing sounds on single coils or brighter leads with humbuckers.

I saw Anthrax bassist Frank Bello using this and thought I'd give it a shot. And I dig it!
I had read some reviews before buying it of course. I'm glad I didn't get the XL version, because mind you I'm 6'3"" and its perfect.
I have it on my Spector NS2000 Q5 at the moment, The elastic in the strap helps it sit perfectly and gives it a little bounce, which takes the weight off. But this also scares me that eventually the elasticity will wear out and stretch down too far.
So far I haven't read any complaints about this, so that's good lol.
All in all if you are looking for a comfy strap...Then buy this!

See my video for details and sound samples.

There was a question about all solid wood or just solid top.  Direct from Tony Conte at Cordoba customer service:
""That is correct, the C3M features a solid cedar top and laminate mahogany back and sides. For your reference, any body woods listed under ""full specs"" at our website for any guitar can be assumed to be laminate unless the word ""solid"" precedes them.""",2

8125,"By Stephen Pate  Unless your guitar is a campfire cheapo, it needs humidification during the heating season. Its one of those annoying things to do in winter like wear your mits and hat on cold days.

We had a late start to winter in Prince Edward Island, Canada but the heat has been on steady for a few weeks and the air in the house is dry. That means my beloved guitars are drying out. The tops, back and sides shrink, the Fretboard shrinks and the guitar goes into distress. Ive seen it all including split necks, the bridge lifting and ugly cracks in the back and top.

A dry guitar sounds dull, dead not like the guitar you played last summer. You can prove this if you audition good guitars in a store with a humidified guitar room and one without. Even awesome guitars sound dead if they are dry.

The damage to the thin woods in your guitar does not normally happen over one winter but before long you will start to see the damage. That being said, a new guitar can get damaged in one dry winter.

Your frets will feel sharp on the ends because the wood in the fretboard is shrinking. The bridge will start to lift. First the wood bows out then the glue joints start to give way.

Guitars need at about 45% relative humidity to keep the wood in tone, the joints glued and the guitar from being destroyed over time.

The other side of being dry is also bad  too much humidity can be more damaging. I was in the Moncton, NB Long and McQuade guitar store last week and the smell of mold in the air told me they had the humidity too high. One quick look at the humidifier and I spotted tons of black mold.

My personal preference are the Oasis Guitar Humidifiers which come in regular (OH-1), guitar case (OH-6), and dry climate (Plus+) versions.

All three Oasis humidifiers follow the same principle  the tube holds crystals that absorb water and release the moisture slowly into the air humidifying the guitar. The tube is filled with water, preferably distilled, using a syringe.

Dry everything off and place the humidifier in the sound hole or case, depending on the model.

Normally I re-fill the tube once a week but its easy if it needs more water, since the tube shrinks when empty.

I just found out you can order the crystals and replenish them annual from http://oasishumidifiers.com/.

The Oasis OH-6 Case Humidifier fits in your guitar case and has a magnetic strip in the tube and metal clip. Not every case has the place to put this.

If I am putting a guitar away for the winter, I use the Herco. If I will play the guitar frequently but keep it in a case, I use the Oasis OH-6.

Oasis also has special instrument humidifiers such as the Oasis Case Plus+ Humidifier, Oasis Mandolin Humidifier, Oasis Ukulele Humidifier, and OH-21 double bass humidifier. Since I haven't tried the OH-21 I cant tell you if it works or not. If you buy the OH-21 from Amazon.com and it does not work, you can return it.",2

8130,"Wow, I am really impressed. I got these for my son's Bullet Squier without expecting much. The original pickups in that guitar were thin and unimpressive, to say at least, and I knew anything I'd throw on it would be an improvement. What a difference the new ones made! The sound is now thicker, juicier, with much more mean and dirty attitude, when playing leads. In the clean channel they have that bell quality, which is what I was after. Clearly pronounced lows and highs, with mids a bit scooped. The single coil hum is very tolerable (and I am sensitive in that area!). Plugged into a Twin Amp this guitar sounds HUGE. I further replaced the tremolo with one that has a true steel block and much more mass. The result: the Bullet Strat now sounds better than my American Deluxe, believe it or not. When I play it, it inspires me to play more... Who would have thought!? Cheers!",2

8137,"I have to admit I was surprised by the quality of the effects on this multi-effects unit. The Lexicon reverb emulations alone are worth the money. I have used multi-effects units in the past (most recently Zoom G2.1nu) and this unit is superior. The ability to turn effects on and off with the 3 foot switches makes this extremely playable in live settings. You can set up a basic patch for a clean guitar, then set up the foot switches to add distortion, delay, flangers, etc. The effects are first rate, the manual is very helpful (unlike most), the variety of effects in each category is impressive (3 different compressors, 23 well known distortion units w/manual control of settings, 54 amp models, chorus/flanger/phaser/vibrato/tremolo/wah/pitch/harmony/octaver, etc, 9 types of delay and 6 types of reverb). I've only had this a couple of weeks, and I've already programmed over 30 favorite settings. There are 100 factory presets that can't be overwritten, and 100 user presets.

The other HUGE advantage to this unit is that it has built in stereo USB in and out for recording. You don't need a $150 USB interface any more- this unit does stereo out to the computer and stereo in from the computer and has a control for adjusting the headphone ratio between the two (for monitoring previous tracks while overdubbing). I now have zero latency when recording/overdubbing into my computer DAW.  High quality unit, great effects. Highly recommended.

IMPORTANT NOTE: after you've poured you heart and ears out crafting guitar patches on this beauty, fine-tuning the sound to fit the song you're playing, it is essential to be able to STORE those patches externally in case of a software melt down.  DigiTech thoughtfully provided the Nexus Editor (PC and MAC) for this purpose HOWEVER it will not run on Windows 10 or the new MAC OS 10!  It is driving me slightly nuts that I spend all this time creating patches and I am currently unable to download them and save them.
MORE IMPORTANT NOTE: Digitech has updated the editor software and IT NOW RUNS ON WINDOWS 10!!

TIP: If I had it to do over, I would get the unit with the expression pedal.",2

The market for fretboard-levellers is much, much smaller. If you are in the market for a fretboard-leveller, this is the one you want. It's a long aluminum rectangle that you can glue sandpaper to, and it comes with some sandpaper strips that you can glue to either side.

In an alternate reality where fretboard-levellers were a household item, where most families had a a set of them in the garage, and another in the kitchen, this item would probably go for somewhere between five and twelve dollars.

The Kala KA-S Ukulele (with binding, as shown here), is a decent starter ukulele for the young and young at heart.  It is a decent starter ukulele if you want to learn and don't want to break the piggy bank.  This is a standard (soprano) size ukulele with little frills.  However, it does not have the toy ukulele look or sound, and the binding around the body adds a bit of class to its appearance.  It has geared tuners, not friction pegs.  This makes tuning the ukulele a tad easier.

There is also a version without the binding, but for the same price&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kala-Mahogany-Soprano-Ukulele-with-No-Binding/dp/B001LU1SFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kala Mahogany Soprano Ukulele with No Binding</a>.

Though the name implies it is made of mahogany, it is actually made of laminate nato, which is referred to as ""eastern mahogany"" and is often used in inexpensive guitars and ukuleles.  However, don't let the make fool you... this baby sounds impressive.  I still play with a KA-S every now and then, and I use it as my beater uke.  It's not solid wood, and therefore does not have the solid wood sound.  But it is still an impressive little instrument.  I generally do not like to purchase music instruments online, but I would make an exception with these.

Kala production models tend to already have decent action (not too high or low), though some might complain the action is a bit high.  It is easy enough to sand the saddle down to your preference.  The nut is glued, but can come off with a bit of effort.  Make sure you get the ones with Nylgut strings (Aquilla) and not the GHS, because it will make the ukulele sound so much better.  If it comes with other strings, you can always change the strings (it's quite easy).  Also, keep in mind that the strings are usually nylon, and are prone to stretching, so don't be surprised if it seems that it is off tune by a half step (or a whole step even) a few hours after tuning.  Give it a week or two of having to retune every day (or in between every song, if you play a lot).  After the strings are stretched out, it will generally stay in tune.

Comparing qualities and build, it is comparable to the Lanikai LU-21.  There is little difference between the two, and for the price, the Lanikai is cheaper by ~$6 and eligible for Amazon Prime (free shipping!).",2
8152,"I first used an SN-8 while visiting a local  music store & was amazed at it's speed, tuning accuracy and easy to read display. (In fact it put my electronic tuner to shame). The following week I ordered one for myself. Once again this little tuner amazes me. I've used it on my Telecaster, my Strat and my vintage acoustic Epiphone, and it always tunes my guitars quickly, precisely and no matter which headstock I put it in I can always find a position where it is very easy to see & read (which was not the case with my other clip-on tuner). I especially like the thick rubber grips that hold it snuggly to the headstock and the large, clear display. The Snark SN-8 is very easy to use & relatively inexpensive. In fact, you might want to keep one in each of your guitars' cases so one is always close at hand. I couldn't be more pleased with a tuner. Highly recommend.",2
8153,"Seems a little flimsy in quality, but what do you expect for this price? Holds my guitar just fine and does seem strong enough for that, but I doubt it will last long.

8156,"I have two nice Taylor's - a steel string and a nylon string, both with solid wood tops and sides. Considering the investment, I take very good care of them. From November through the end of March, I keep them in a room with a door when they are not in the case. I run a room humidifying with distilled water 24/7 in that room throughout the dry season. I also use one of these in each guitar whenever I am not playing them. Part of the nighttime routine is filling the room humidifier tank and dipping the sponges and setting these Planet waves humidifiers in the sound holes. The whole process takes a few minutes and is worth it to keep my guitars in great condition. When I take the guitars anywhere, I put one of these in each sound hole before I put the guitars in their cases. Winter whether in New England get extremely dry in the cold months, so these are necessary. Easy to use. Durable. Simple.",2
8157,"So, I have a Roland Cube and Vox practice amp, Fender Deluxe and Marshall TSL602 gigging amps. Been downsizing, looking for a ""fit"" little practice amp. Thought the FLY 3 might be the answer.  Primarily, Fender guitars.  Hence, the clean side must be useable, rich and responsive for me.

I'm very impressed by the ISF EQ.  Clean channel:  The American side of the dial is not quite Fender, but is has some sparkle. The Brit side of the dial is more Marshall than Vox at 5 o'clock, but is it a nice dark vibe. Very useable, there is a wide and varied range of useable sounds. The gain control will give you harmonic break-up as needed. The delay can be set to mimic a reverb. OD Channel: Not really my thing, but you can push it from Vox into dark Peavey territory through the use of the ISF EQ.. I haven't been able to get a retro crunch out of it, but maybe I need to work it a little more. Nice to have the OD channel, though unlike I'll have the dial dimed to the right.

The two speaker combo pack comes with the adapter, that's essential for me. I'm not going to keep replacing batteries.

The two speaker set-up adds the expected depth, it seems like a much bigger rig. Perfect for playing around the house, and easy to move.  Sound-wise, I'd say excellent. Wonderful harmonics and responsiveness given the size and cost of the unit.  If you aren't in love with the sound, a little tweak of the EQ makes it fairly easy to dial in the sound in your head. Although the Roland will put out a lot more sound and effects, the useable sounds and ease of use of the Blackstar kills it for casual practice, and even this two speaker package was 1/3 the cost of the Roland.

I sure wish this had been available when I was first learning to play electric guitar, this is in another universe compared to the boat anchors I was carrying around.",2

8159,"OEM Fender replacement part (bagged and badged). Replaced the POS, scratchy tone pot in my American, 2000 Big Apple Strat. For an American made guitar, it came with some real shady electronics. The wiring job was done well, but the pots looked like they went through the ringer and I bought the guitar new, so I know there was no funny business. This replacement part with tone cap included, cleaned up my issues of a stiff, scratchy pot and muddy sound that cleaning could not resolve. Good parts, good price.",2
8160,"This pedal performs as well as the Boss bass synth, with one exception. Behringer's pedals have decent buffers but they suck tone. The part of the tone that gets sucked is your attack - you get a bit of undesirable compression. This is most noticeable with this pedal and with the SF300 fuzz, where one has to hammer a note much harder than usual to get the ""same"" sound one was expecting. The ways to get around this are to put some other pedal first in the chain and/or run on battery power. Danelectro 9-volts are cheap and discharge in a more linear fashion so I find them very useful here.

Now, the pedal itself. I got this to add some harshness/noise to my guitar rig and it does very well there. I put it in between my guitar overdrive and distortion and with a footcontroller I can get those circuit bent 8-bit sounds pretty easily. On bass I pick one setting and leave it alone (usually one of the last 3 modes). You can use this to fatten up any sound simply by turning the freq and resonance down and leaving the 'Effect' knob fairly low; with an EHX Steel Leather before this pedal going into a decent amp, you can get sounds that have tremendous low end thump, synth bite and guitar-esque distortion all at once. A great box for those looking for some new sounds...",2
8161,Awesome for the money,2
8162,"The ""guitar"" setting works pretty well. You need you vical to be spot on for it to track well. Keeping the harmony mix low it sounds good. Some keys the harmony get too high for my taste, mostly a. ice effect. The pedal is also a DI and my guitar sounds good through it as well.",2

8191,Gotta read the manual and spend some time with it. It is very comprehensive and if you don't spend some time reading the manual and understanding its work flow then you  may be disappointed. After working with it for a bit though it really comes alive! It does so much in one little stomp box! Great for home recording studios. Not so sure about playing out although it's pretty rugged.,2
8192,"I'd gotten into mostly fingerpicking both acoustic and electric guitar for a few years now, and when strumming would just use my fingers. When I started trying to strum (especially on acoustic) again, it seemed my hand wanted to relax and cause me to drop the pick. A friend turned me on to these, and I haven't looked back. Nice, thick rubber grip, very comfortable, but with plenty of flex OR rigidity, depending on how you grip them. My go-to pick for picks, nowadays.

*EDIT: Having used these for a few months now, I have to say that the rubber extends too far down the pick for my tastes. I was constantly catching the rubber on the strings, which would cause some drag and deadening of the notes. I've begun cutting the rubber back a bit with an Exacto knife before using them. Otherwise, still very satisfied.",2

I recently got a Gretsch that had these strings. It seemed effortless to play on that guitar so I thought I'd try them on the Gibson. I also realized that if you press down hard on your fretboard like I tend to do, thicker strings may make it easier for you to play. It's hard to explain but it works for me. Anyway, D'Addario probably makes half of the strings out there, so you might as well just go to the source if you want great quality strings at a great price.",2
8198,These strings cost a little more but they are definitely worth it.  They hold up better than any string I've found and sound great throughout their life.,2
8199,"This really has to be one of the cheapest, easiest, important things to have when you own a guitar.  Very easy to work with, screen is sort of a yellow orange, and goes green when its in tune.  For me, thats awesome.  I will probably buy a few of these for christmas gifts.

Like all of these multi-effects units, the factory made patches suck for the most part. I think out of 200, I found 20 liked and will use.  But I have already made several EVH patches, and Orange patch, a Soldano and a couple Marshall's and they sound spot on tot he real thing.  I wish they would add a ENGL Fireball and an Egnater to the mix but perhaps in the future.  Some of the artist made patches are good, again I find about 10% that I like and will use. I am running this unit in stereo into a Roland GA-212",2
8206,"Doesn't really seem to improve tuning stability for me. Perhaps I'm restringing my guitar wrongly. But they sure make it A LOT easier and faster to replace the strings since you don't have to do a lot of winding.

8209,"So, I have a 1986 Ovation Legend. The entire fret board neck warped really bad. Especially at the #10 through #14 frets. Pretty much where the board meets body. Guitar was not really playable. I tried to raise the action and so strings became too high to have any decent playability . I was going to toss it when I came across,by chance, this little beauty! I am very handy/capable. I sanded away until fairly flat and then lowered the nut a bit as well the bridge until the action was as low as possible without string bottom out. I was successful thanks to the FRET GURU. I can't believe how my Ovation now plays better than when I bought it in 1986 for $650. Cost today is over $1200. !!  ouch!  Machining is well done. I had to take some frets down so much that i'm now going to have to find a product that can bring back the tapered top to the Frets as now some are too flat. I can't move up/down quick enough as smoothness of same Frets now diminished. That's my bad as I allowed neck to warp so bad.  Awesome product !  ROCK ON!!",2

The setup was still aweful. I asked the technician if there was any way to make it play better. After paying for a fret redress and truss rod adjutment. It was a tiny bit better but the strings were still way too far from the neck. I asked him to take a little bit of height out of the nut, as I was deperate for an expensive guitar like a Les Paul to play like, well a Gibson Les Paul and not an acoustic. Still no help. I decided that I had put enough money in this new Les Paul. I done some research and also have had issues with the dreaded G string ping with every Les Paul I have owned. I went to change strings, bone nut fell out of it's slot. I decided to try the Graph Tech Black Jumbo XL. I had to order a second as the first one I sanded too far down and had to buy another and measure correctly. I am very happy with the performance of this nut. As my action is still too high for my liking but tolerable. The quality of sound has increased by quite a bit. Especially open cords. They ring out beautifully and the sustain seem to go forever. The best part is that I no longer need to buy Nut Sauce or use graphite to keep the G string from pinging. This nut eliminates all of that. I am still not happy with my action but I know the reason is not the nut. I will use these exclusively from now on. A must for Les Paul owners, do yourself a favor and avoid bone altogether.",2

8220,"This is my first patchbay and I'm quite pleased with it. For years I've been crawling around behind the racks in my small studio wiring and re-wiring gear every time I want to reconfigure my signal chains. But no longer will I be covered in dust bunnies and spiders, thanks to the S-patch Plus. This thing really is a game changer, especially for those of us less experienced with what can be a rather confusing ""simple"" tool- it's well built and packs a lot of common-sense functionality into a small space.

The best part about the S-patch is the freedom it gives you to choose Normalled, Half-normalled or Thru functions with the flip of a switch on each input-output pair. This is really convenient, especially if, like me, you're new to patchbays and want to experiment with functionality and signal chain options. The switches are sturdy, as are the jacks and the metal casing of the unit itself- no cheap plastic or thin faceplates here. I've noticed no loss or degradation of signal when tracking or mixing with the unit and I've found the signal flow diagrams printed on the top of the casing to be very helpful as well.

My only complaint is that the unit doesn't come with Rack Screws, which isn't a huge deal, but it would be nice. It does come with stick-on rubber feet in a little bag, which I'm not using because I have it racked but they would be nice if you had this sitting on a desk. Additionally, some folks have commented on how there isn't much room on the face of the unit for labeling each channel. This is true, but that's the price you pay for a single rack space size unit. I got around this by purchasing a 2 foot long, 1.5"" wide, 1/8"" thick strip of aluminum at the local hardward store for 3 bucks. I used a jigsaw to cut it to ~19"" long like a standard rack unit blank. I drilled out holes in the ends for screws and mounted it just above the S-patch on my rack. Then I stole my wife's labelmaker and created stick-on labels for each piece of gear connected to the patchbay, and stuck them vertically to the aluminum strip. This plate can easily be removed to access the diagrams on the top of the S-patch when you get confused on what the heck-swoggle ""half-normal"" means.

One word of caution, especially if you're new to this: while any TRS bay will pass phantom power from a preamp to a mic, you run the risk of ""hotpatching"" your mics if you plug in cables while the phantom power is engaged. This can really damage your preamps. If you're really careful, you can get around this by simply never patching a live mic, but this is always going to be a gamble, especially if you're like me and your brain is in 67 places at once during a session. So while it's tempting to put all your preamps ""behind"" the bay, it's better run the output of each pre to a channel of the patchbay which is then normalled to your interface / board. For example, in my studio if I want to plug a mic into an outboard preamp, I use the following chain:
Mic --- xlr patchbay (much safer for phantom than trs) --- Preamp --- S-patch channel normalled to line input on my interface. This means that my mics always run directly to my interface via my outboard preamps UNLESS I break the normal via patch cable. Any phantom power thus flows to the mic from the preamp ""ahead"" of the S-patch. Remember, phantom power flows the opposite direction of mic signal!

Overall, I'm very happy with the S-patch and I already can't imagine my control room without it. It's also already full, so I'll likely buy another soon.",2
8221,Ok i hope just getting it tuned up,2
8222,"I bought the wrong strength, however I bought these with the 3 strength and they worked out fine, they respond well. They are cheaper in the 3 pack and I tried them because of that. They do not last as long as Van Doren ZZ's in my opinion however.",2

They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on, sound bright, and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever, you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less, that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos.",2

8231,Worth every penny! I've just finished a product demo of these for my sound company (X13 Sound Services)and I'm stunned. Anyone that is looking at the ELX15 should save themselves the money and go with these. That is unless you absolutely need a wooden cabinet. These have all the same components as the ELX just in a lightweight plastic enclosure. The wooden cabs will give you just a hair more punch in the low end but if you're looking for real low end you should have a sub. These will do great for dj's kj's acoustic performers and even small band rehearsal.,2

8234,"This is a wonderful all-purpose vocal microphone. I've had one for about three years, and it's performed flawlessly each time I've pulled it out. I recently purchased two more to have on hand for podcasting with guests.

As others have mentioned, this mic is really well suited toward podcasting. It has a nice sound about it, and is fairly accurate with what it picks up. I've also used it for voice-over work, and with a small PA for band rehearsals and events. It works well in all those areas, and the price tag makes it an excellent value proposition. While this mic may not necessarily hold a candle to mics like the SM7b or an AT4050, it is perfect for either those on a budget, or someone looking to build a mobile rig. It's a very durable microphone, will take a beating well, and is easily replaceable if someone manages to break one. And for what its worth, I actually like this mic better than the RE20.

While it does claim to have two layers of windscreen protection, that's a load of old codswallop. Without proper protection, you'll have plosives for days (don't blame the mic, blame the technique). I'd recommend getting a ball to put over it. I use the ones from OnStage. They're under $5, fit nicely, and work well.",2
8235,"I suppose it is next to impossible to please everyone but this product has not let me down (thus far) and I am picky when it comes to sound quality.

To me, its good for getting that kind of over the top, wild 80s midrangey Marshall sound.  It does sound like a pedal, but one isn't as likely to notice the difference at lower volumes, which is where this pedal shines. To me, the Hot Plexi sounds more ""real"", closer than this.  That being said, this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi, which is why I tend to use this one, JF-03, for when I want a classic rock type sound, and save the Hot Plexi for hair metal, EVH, and more gainey stuff stuff.  Through an actual tube amp, the Hot Plexi will sound better, maybe because the Crunch distortion comes off as shrill through a typical tube amp.",2

8257,"I received a free item to review:

I do a lot of instrument setups, nut replacements, and action adjustments on electric and acoustic instruments. I've had the Stew Mac version of this gauge for years, as well an earlier version of this 'Baroque' model that I picked up online.

This latest version is clearly improved, although the information and position of all the markings remains the same. The earlier markings were much darker than those on the Stew Mac but they looked crude in spots, blotchy, with uneven lines. It honestly looked as though the markings were done with a fine Rapidograph rather than precision-etched. Kind of a mess that I used only when I couldn't immediately find my Stew Mac gauge.

The markings on this latest 'Baroque' gauge are much cleaner. I especially like the way the height markers have been redone as 'pixel-like grids' instead of the solid rectangular blobs on the earlier model. The thousandths and 1/64ths of an inch rules are both easy to read and even-textured.

The 'Baroque' gives all the markings the Stew Mac gauge does and a bit more units-wise: The height markers run along both sides, one length in mm, the other in thousandths of an inch. The back side has a 3 inch rule along one side with a corresponding 75mm on the opposing edge. I also build instruments from plans and books and it's good to have rules with small metric and imperial markings. That said, the larger fraction/decimal/metric conversion table on the back of the Stew Mac gauge serves me very well.

The string action guide on the back of the Baroque gauge doesn't add much value for me. I set up instruments based on so many factors: string gauge, playing style, fingerboard radius, neck relief, etc. that I use these gauge merely to measure relative adjustments - in the end it still comes down to 'feel'.

One significant downside of this newer gauge carried over from the earlier model: the metal background is too reflective and makes all the markings harder to read than they need be, particularly when working with close light. This is where I still prefer the flat finish of the Stew Mac gauge - in spite of its too-light markings.

Bottom Line: It really comes down to tradeoffs: how you like to use tools, and the environment you're working in. This version of the Baroque gauge is just as accurate as the Stew Mac and gives you a little more, but the overall readability is hampered by the reflective background.",2
8258,Awesome,2
8259,I was surprised how easy it was to use.  Wish holes for on off were bigger. Need a transmitter for these to work. I bought 6 all worked fine,2
8260,They're springs. They work. Four stars only as they're not slinkys.,2
8261,I'm glad that somebody finally came up with the strap lock design that's not a total pain in the butt.,2

8264,Cant say enough about this product !,2
8265,"I have to give this instrument a 5 star review ! I bought the ""as is ""  3 years old ( new ) , unchecked , for the price of $ 49.00 . The uke is a x-mas present for my son ( 38 years old ). I have been playing guitar for 52 years , and was fully expecting to set-up , adjust , new strings , polish ect. This was del. with free shipping .Opened the box to see a brand new perfect instrument . This is no toy. It is a perfectly playable instrument , well made , and great sounding . Since it is a baritone it is tuned like the top 4 strings of a guitar . I tuned it up and all of a sudden I am a uke player . Very well made , and well worth the money at 5 times the price . I would reccomend this instrument to anybody that is intrested . I think I am going to have to buy one for myself now !!!!!UPDATE ! , I ordered one for myself , and it was del . today .Exactly like the one I bought for my son . Wiped it down with lemon oil . cleaned up the strings , and tuned it up . So much fun , no dead spots , intonation is right on , action is great right out of the box ! I LOVE it !!!!!!!!!!!",2

8272,"I love DRs. They feel and sound unique; piano string-like, which is incredible and just how i want my bass to sound. Very versatile and they only get better with age, imho. I can't stand other strings in contrast, but I'm pretty opposed to trying anything else.",2
8273,"For years I played the original Cry baby, the Vox Wah, and others I can't remember names of. I was always on a quest for a good wah sound that I just couldn't find. I didn't want to spend $600 on a wah with a rack. So at the recomendation of a studio engineer I purchased this wah about 5 years ago. I am very pleased that I followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah I was looking for. The greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable. The user dials in the frequency sweep they want. The volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix. I recomend this wah pedal over all the others, especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking.",2
8274,"Okay, I have been hesitant to buy this since day one. Now I feel stupid for waiting so long. I already own an 0-Coast and thought this would be simple and limited in comparison. Wrong again! There are so many things I like about this. Manual is beautiful, but could use a little work in some areas. Sound is fantastic and it is quite versatile. Sequencer is tons and tons of fun. Midi just works.

This is a great unit to learn synthesis, make music and to grow with. It is a fantastic compliment to my 0-Coast too. Oh, and those classic Moog sounds... they are here you Lucky Man. Looking back I should have bought this first and long ago. Oh, and if someone complains about a single oscillator being a limitation, I say blah blah blah. A creative and industrious person will find a millions things to do with this. Enjoy!",2

Many reviewers state that the pickups could use an upgrade to which I would have to agree if you are interested in more than just playing ""clean"" thru your amp.  I've only played the instrument for a few hours since getting it; I will probably upgrade with some GFS pups in the near future.  Otherwise, it's a very nice instrument for the money, plays just as well as any gibby for far less coin.",2
8291,HIGH QUALITY. Easy on and off. Worth the money to protect my expo.,2
8292,For practice: Next best thing besides guitar! Very sturdy & adjustable,2
8293,"Great strings if you like them light.  Improves your speed across the fret board and makes that F bar chord feel like you're barely touching the strings.  And yes, you can bend these pretty easy, too. Just remember that lighter strings means less sustain and less dynamic range.

As for the XL brand, these strings are real steel, rarely break, and have a very smooth, silky finish and feel. Excellent tone as well.",2
8294,Velcro could be better but great for road work.,2
8295,"The one I received is defective - will not work on batteries ( I checked the batteries and they're fine) so I guess it's going back.
I think it is similar brightness to, but has more light spread than, the Kootek I also have. The color temperature is closer to 2700K (yellowish)  whereas the Kootek is more like 6000K (stark white).  This is almost too yellow when coupled with old yellowed orchestra parts, but excellent for white paper with no eyestrain, which I seem to feel from the bluish-white lights..
There is no lip across the back to shield other's eyes, but since the bulbs are recessed and covered with a lens, as long as I keep it horizontal to the floor I don't think it is a problem. Does make it less bulky to carry, as does the folding together of the two light halves.
The power cord is about 9.5 feet - very helpful!
The base is pretty big, about 50% bigger than the Kootek's since it is made to hold 3 AA batteries, but I haven't found it to be a problem yet.
I took a picture of the Kootek on the left and the Maestro Gear on the right with white paper - it's not quite right color-wise, but the best I could do.
----------
Update - the seller is super nice and immediately sent out a replacement that works well.  I expect I'll use this light a lot. Thank you!
=== 6 months later, I prefer the Kootek for gigs.  It's easy, just plug in overnight after a gig and good to go again. I'm only using this one plugged in , and getting tired of the yellow light, especially uncomfortable on yellowed music paper.",2

8297,"Being a retired piano teacher who took up acoustic guitar (steel string and classical) about 3 years ago, I am super surprised at the quality of sound that this wonderful, wonderful amp for acoustic guitar produces. I am using a VOX acoustic guitar cord with this amp and find that it provides clean sounds that are natural to the instrument and bring out the qualities of the individual guitar sound and its tone woods. It is plenty powerful enough for practice and small venues. It won't shake the roof off the building but I don't need it to do that.",2
8298,Thanks,2
8299,"I'd like to give this guitar 5 stars, but it's just too cheap! There's lots of clues suggesting where corners were cut to keep this price point, but the sound of this guitar IS NOT one of them.

I bought this without a demo based on price and reviews and couldn't believe how good it sounded out of the box. When people say it sounds better than any $200 starter guitar, they're telling the truth.

The things I haven't read from others are how brutal the factory setup and Martin strings (as nice as they sound) are on your fingers. It came with the action set WAY TOO HIGH. I was afraid that if I adjusted the truss bar and changed to light strings that it wasn't going to maintain its sound.  I was wrong.  I swapped out the Martin strings for Ernie Ball Earthwood 80/20 Light, and lowered the action by at least one full revolution of the truss bar, and it sounds even better now. AND it's much more playable.

Even considering the price, this is not a 5 star instrument.  If you don't know how, or aren't comfortable making adjustments yourself, you'd probably spend as much to get it set up as you paid for it.  Otherwise, I would think any beginner would lose interest trying to tame this thing for any length of time. The spruce top alone is worth the extra $25 over the RA-90D, but its still a laminate, and despite the sound that it makes, it's clearly thrown together as quickly and easily as the plant in China can turn them out. It looks OK, but it's not a show piece, and parts of the structure look crude. I have little hope that it'll still be playable in 5 or more years. But at this price, who cares?",2
8300,"Reliable cord and looks like a puzzle at the moment. Gets unplugged and plugged often and only once had a bad connection to a Strat that went away with a couple of turns. The usual 1/4"" plug stuff. I suppose any non-coiled cord would look like this if used for utility in a single location long enough. No signal degradation that I can hear. I like it - does what I wanted it to.",2
8301,Wow this in combination with Rocksmith is an awesome kit. Got mine on time and was like a kid in a candystore. Once I got the package open to find an absolute beauty of a starter guitar. Maybe I am biased as I have always wanted to learn. At 36 and winning my bout with cancer so far I am to put that extra time to good use. Thank you Amazon and Epiphone for a wonderful product I hope to get years of enjoyment out of. Everything was safely packed and arrived in flawless condition from what I could tell in my excitement. Will look over a little better tomorrow but expect no issue. A great thing about Rocksmith as well as the tuner that comes with you will be able to get and keep your guitar in tune even as a beginner like me who has but only picked up a few guitars but never played a note. Highly recommend to anyone looking to learn to play.,2
8302,A bit rough on the fingers but are good strings.,2
8303,I bought a blue guitar from them and I had no problems tuning my guitar and the strings did not pop off they were very sturdy. and I still have the same strings it came with on my guitar. this is truly a good guitar like I said I didn't buy the purple I bought the blue and then it is amazing. but I am going to buy the purple one for my daughter as a Christmas gift.,2
8304,"Perfect tuner, don't know why people pay $75 for tuner pedals, mute function schmute function.",2
8305,"Does exactly what it's supposed to. Comfortable, strong, adjustable, and the pocket for the pick is a plus. Perfect!",2
8306,"I'm new to the Caline brand, but based on this experience for a very modest investment of around $30, I may be looking at one or two others.  Caline is brand of Chinese clones/copies/impersonations of popular boutique pedals that usually cost between $150 and $300.  I've used a fair number of clones, most of them Joyo, and had very positive experiences all around.  I had heard that the Caline pedals were built similarly to the early Joyos, so I thought I would take a (pretty modest) risk on one.

The CP-18 Orange Burst appears to be a clone of the Xotic BB Preamp, which was actually a pedal I had barely heard of before I came across this one.  I have not played the Xotic model, but the basic functionality of the Orange Burst is the same, and I'm pleased to say that it's quite good.  More importantly, it offers something a bit different that the boosters and light overdrive pedals I already have, which is terrific in a 30-dollar purchase.

The Orange Burst, fundamentally, is a booster.  There's a lot of debate over the technical difference between boost, overdrive, and distortion (my unit actually says ""OVERDRIVE"" across the bottom, but the cliff notes version of that is that by boosting the input gain of a guitar signal, you can create an overdriven sound.

Boosters, therefore, are relatively straightforward effects, and I would certain never pay close to $200 for one, as I am a hobbyist, not a professional, working musician.  But the Orange Burst has two features that I find useful and a unique.  First, it has independent volume and gain controls, which means that it operates more or less as a transparent clean boost with the Gain at ""0"" and the Volume turned up.  This is a nice feature, since other boosters (like my EHX LPB-1) may have only a single level or gain control, so you can only really add gain/saturation, as opposed to just boosting your level.

Second, The Bass and Treble controls are independent +/-15dB  boost/cut controls for high and low frequencies.  What this means is that if you are using the Orange Burst as a fairly transparent booster, but your resulting sound it too bright (or dark), you can boost or cut the highs or lows without completely changing the overall tone.  I know that EQ control on boosters has expanded in recent years (notably in the MXR Micro Plus), but I'm not sure that some of the other options give as much control as this pedal does at shaping your sound.

Plug this pedal alone into a relatively clean tube amp, and you get a pretty amazing range of tonal options - everything from pure clean boost, to bassy Bluesbreaker crunch, to ""gainier"" sounds you would associate with a more traditional OD or Distortion pedal.

Oh, and the build quality?  I'm actually quite impressed so far.  The early run Joyo pedals (JF-01 to JF-17) are a fair comparison, though I think the footswitch on this one might ""feel"" even a bit more reliable.  There is a 9V adapter jack on the left side below the output jack.  And while assume there was a ton of cost savings done on the circuit board and pots, the 4 pots have a good resistance to them, and, frankly, feel more comparable to my Wampler than some of the other ""cheap"" pedals I have played.  Having said that, I do think that budget pedals like this are an ""either/or"" proposition: In most cases, you will get a perfectly functioning unit that will suit the needs of players who don't abuse their gear, but there is always the risk of a defective unit or some component failing that is some unknown percentage more likely than it would be on a unit from an establish company with better quality control.  At $30, I feel that's a worthwhile risk, and I'm really enjoying the Orange Burst.",2
8307,"Listened to a bunch of YouTube postings on this one. And, it lives up to everything I've heard. Had to wait a couple of weeks, due the pedal being out of stock (go figure?) and it arrived today! I am amazed at what EHX puts into their effects. This has got to be one of my favorite OD pedals to date!",2
8308,"I am able to adjust these straps at will, whether I am standing,sitting or just feel a need to change the position of the accordion.

8318,"I bought this for an ""always on"" pedal to make my sound more consistent, not as a ""squishy"" effect, so I didn't need it to do much.  I can tell my sustain is improved, but the effect is so subtle, it doesn't change my tone at all.  So if only as an improvement on my sustain, it's a great pedal.  Does it compress my dynamics?  I honestly can't tell.",2

When compared to a stock Shure 92E, this Audio Technica 92ECD stands head and shoulders above the stock Shure in terms of high frequency response-cymbals etc. I'm sure the narrower elliptical stylus helps. However, a Shure M92e with an upgraded stylus gives this AT a good run for the money. No, the AT's not as ""neutral"" sounding as the Shure, but, to my ear anyway is also quite balanced. This is a good basic upgrade cartridge. It's not an ""audiophile"" contender but reproduces music nicely, well beyond most basic cartridges. Good ""universal"" value especially in that it can be used as either a P mount or standard. Have a listen, you can't go wrong for the price.",2
8332,"Initially purchased to march in high school; I've used these in rock and roll bands since, now almost 40 years off and in. Pitch and tone are harder to control than with good came reeds, but if you're growling into the horn anyway who cares. The upside is a reed that is the same anytime you play it, for months of the heaviest use at fff. It wears out by developing cracks near the tip and going soft, you would easily be into your third box of cane reeds by that time. the consistency is truly a godsend when you're not playing a lot.

They run hard. The soft is still pretty hard, I only ever had one med and I found it unplayable. I used 2.5-3.5 back in the day.",2

8345,"I have to confess to a particular image that comes to mind when I think of capos.  It's the image of an earnest folkie, with mastery of C, G and D, but still struggling with the A. A good player should be comfortable in any key.  But there's still an occasional place for a capo, and that's when you need open strings in a chord.

I tested this capo on several guitars, and with one exception it worked well.  Steel-string dreadnought, archtop jazz box, and Les Paul worked nicely.  Not so much on a flat fretboard classical.  The capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck.  But on a flat neck there's a little string buzz on the D and G strings.  While the capo's grip is good, it still needs to be fitted right behind the fret.  This means that it can get a little bit in the way for passage work. That's probably a rare problem for the intended user.

All in all it's a nice little capo.  Goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks.",2

8350,"I purchased this in order to have a small interface for traveling and sometimes to record at night on a different machine.  Maybe I would rate it higher. I found that everything works very well I have audio interfaces that are part of some other machine ( Digital recorder, effects unit). I don't get any latency with those interfaces. On the Mac in Live  I get some latency  using the Behringer but interestingly not when I use a plug-in like amplitube.  In addition you need to download the driver to work with windows. This is not difficult at all but just letting you know. It's fun late at night to have a simple interface works great  With GarageBand, mix craft and pretty well with live like I said I'm not sure if a """" better""interface would have less latency. Everything works nicely, I do like Behringer but ironically I think I would travel with a different interface maybe I would've returned it if it was convenient.  For the price and the quality it's a great first audio interface for a beginner and perhaps a convenient one where you don't need bells and whistles. I'm a little wary of buying an older used interface and this is just about the least expensive and quite small.  For now I'll keep it though I might sell it at some point. If you need a small interface that takes up very little room and easy to use and does have Direct monitoring I think  this is a good unit.  Small well-built interfaces go for around $100  so this one will save you money if that's an issue or is a great spare for travel, the office, or where you don't want to break up your studio  but you need an interface with another computer or to record elsewhere. For the size you could just carried around in the car so you can record wherever you go.",2

8366,"I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.

First, if you are practicing dynamics, this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time, but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range, so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics, this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me, this is effective. Moreover, since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics, listening and time.

A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care, but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.

Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough, download a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Decibel-O-Meter-Free/dp/B0054KJND6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Decibel-O-Meter Free</a>&nbsp;and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be, but for many like an acoustic piano, guitar, etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.",2

I know 13's are heavier than usual, but since I started as a bass player, I couldn't really feel 11's or 12's on an acoustic.",2
8370,Interesting little wash light ... makes the wall look like fire.,2
8371,again ok,2
8372,"Fit my guitar (just a standard, cheap dreadnought) wonderfully, and gave it way more life and warmth than I expected. I've used it both to plug into my amp and to record on my computer via an audio interface (can't mic my guitar at night due to traffic noise). The latter gives it kind of a tinnier sound, but with a bit of tinkering, you can get it to sound pretty natural.

The volume seems an issue, though. This could easily be due to my using an electric guitar amp instead of an acoustic one, but I really do have to crank the gain before it starts to pick up. It isn't so bad that things start to get static-y, but you still hear a faint hum with it. For live gigs, I'd never mind, but for recording, it's slightly annoying.

As for construction, it's still working like new five months later.",2

8380,"Updated Review (11/24/2017 4-stars):
Tempi Team criticized my original review because ""the instructions weren't followed."" I went back to the instructions and it clearly says, ""(1) Open the protection cover and the bottom protector. (2) Start: Turn the winding key..."" But I couldn't turn the winding key. I was ready to return it back, but then I received their comment to the original review. They were talking about a foam, etc. I went back to the box, and in addition to the instruction there's a tiny piece of paper that says ""TIPS"". That's where they talk about the foam. I opened the bottom of the metronome with a flat-head screw driver, and sure enough there's a foam. Pulled out the foam and the metronome came to life. Good grief.

While I stick to my original assessment of cheap plastic on the outside, the mechanical components inside the metronome are anything but. I respect the fact that the company has passion and strength to stand by their product. Hopefully this revised review will also help others using it.

Original Review (1-star):
I bought this because it had received high review rating. Not only does it feel cheap, when it arrived it would not wind to get the pendulum moving. Really poor quality.",2
8381,"Shipping was fast, item arrived has advertised. I bought this for quiet rehearsal for my bass guitar and so far I'm impressed by it. I simply adjust the gain and tone down to zero and just use the volume control and i get a great clean bass tone. I like the idea of a USB recharge and also the extra items in the package are a nice touch..I didn't feel like paying double the cost for a amplug with a Vox logo on it.",2

8384,"I've tried just about every make of round wound electric guitar strings in the last 30-40 years, and I've settled on D'Addarios for all my guitars. Their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency, the price is right, they're color coded to make string changing easier, and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more. The 10s are my choice for rock and blues.",2
8385,"Started to write this as a comment to someone else, but it got longe enough to stand on its own.  So here ya go:

The Tone Match T1 Engine performs the job of a rack full of equipment.  It's an advanced signal processor, a very capable EQ, a 5 channel mixer, an outstanding pre-amp, a ghost mic power supply, a kick bass mic processor, a guitar (and piano) tuner, and so much more all packed into a tiny little box with a SUPER EASY interface.  Bose did a remarkable job cramming all that capability in.  That being said, it does have a few limitations.  Tho for what it does, well frankly a couple limitations seems more than acceptable.  Consider this:  Take your 500 pound main rack and cram it into a 2 pound palmtop head the size of a mid 90's portable CD player, add balanced AND unbalanced inputs, multiple outputs, and viola!  T1.

Some of the details:

Contrary to many of the other comments I've read, it does actually have standard stereo outs (in addition to the digital output to the L1 base).  Both the MAIN and the AUX outputs are stereo.  You can connect it to multiple L1 systems (compact, model I(s), and Model II) for seperate Left & Right channels.  Sure it would be really cool if there was a way to connect the proprietary digital cable to 2 L1 Model IIs and designate them L/R or master/slave, but aside from that, it's still working like a charm.  I would like to see the L1 models have an OUT cable, so you can daisychain them, they could then be self-addressing, and you could hook as many of them as you want to the chain.

As a wedding DJ, I used to carry a mini system in addition to my old big system, that was used for the procession.  The big system was set up for the recession/party room.  In rare instances, the 2 settings are near enough to each other, or where the procession was done outside on a patio, we would leave that mini system set up to boost the sound to the outdoor area for the party (so it wasn't just horrid bass thumps out there).  The Tone Match engine successfully drives 2 L1 Model II + B2 sets in the party room, and 2 L1s + B1 sets outside.  I love the super easy setup, and the minimal number of cables.  I am currently testing a wireless setup to send the remote system over 5ghz (didn't want any 2.4ghz interference).  That will allow me to drive the mini system completely wireless, INCLUDING the wireless mic at the altar.  It's been working superbly well in testing so far, but I haven't deployed it to an actual wedding yet.  All of this is STILL running on just 1 T1 Engine.  I get compliments all the time on the power of this system for its TINY size.  People are amazed that I can drive a 300+ wedding with crisp, clean music and thundering bass coming from these things.  (PS - pay the extra and get the B2, it's light years ahead of a stack of B1s).  Yeah, it's an expensive setup, but I don't have to haul around 2,000 pounds of giant speakers, amps, and huge mix boards.  I'll take the price for the clean look and ease of transportation any day.

Use as a small, portable PA system:
The T1 is tiny, and it's matched PERFECTLY with the L1 system(s).  With a stereo input for your music player of choice plus 3 mics, it is easily able to handle all manner of small gigs, parties, karaoke, and all around general purpose PA needs.  The feature list is endless in this regard, with all the advanced signal processing you can tune each mic to the user's voice, and with just a couple minutes of setup, weed out 90% of the annoying sound problems small parties are plagued by.

Use as a Band or live performance mixer/engine:
again, endless features and capabilities.  This is where the T1 was designed to live and breathe.  Easily comfortable to use, quick adustments, and a single cable connection from its location up to the main speaker up front allows any band member to be the central control point, complete with an aux/headphone/monitor output local to the user.

Use as a DJ's primary mix board:
The signal processing features are outstanding here, with gate and compression for varying room dynamics, delay and reverb features to build better sound on the dance floor, no matter how far away it is from the booth, and much more.  This little box replaces a rack full of BBEs, EQs, and other equipment.  However, it shows some of the limitations in that it has only one set of linked stereo inputs, no panning ability, and no cross-channel fade function.  So, it might not be the best choice for a full size primary DJ mix board, however, it is an outstanding primary engine behind the mix board, and if you need a lot of mics (like Karaoke), it's a perfect place to add them in.

Things I would like to see:
The biggest thing that would make this a truly outstanding mix head would be if the USB connection dumped into channels 6&7 seperate from 4&5.  While the 4/5 inputs remain operational with a USB input, it does require some level setting external to the T1.  It would seem like a firmware update to the T1 should fix this.

The Aux output can be used as a cue/headphone jack to listen to signals that are not on mains, but it is a minor bit of a pain to change the aux channel, and there is a tiny bit of risk that you might accidentally change the wrong input, interrupting your program.  I use the aux output tapped at the main, to drive the mini set above, so this doesn't happen, but yeah, you get the idea.

the panning issue... It seems like this is a massive oversight on Bose's part, and frankly I'm surprised that it hasn't been fixed yet.  You cannot pan mics to one side or the other (or play the ch 4/5 mix one side or mono only).  Sure it's probably rare that you would want to play one side only, but there are instances when it would be desirable.

the mounting bracket situation...  The system comes with a bracket that fits the L1 Model I and II, but not the L1 compact.  There is a seperate little adapter you can get to attach it to a mic stand, but it seems to be fairly flimsy for the price tag of the device it's holding.  bose is relatively good about warranty tho, so I would be very surprised if the adapter legitimately broke and damaged the T1 and they didn't replace it.  I would like to see the adapter included with the engine, it's not that expensive to throw in the same box.  They should also look at making a bracket that attaches to the L1 Compact riser pole, or sell a riser pole that has the groove in the back to set the existing bracket in.  It might also be handy to have a bracket that can attach to truss poles, which are larger diameter than the mic stand bracket can handle.

Power supply:  With an L1 system, power is supplied thru the base unit, which is great because it reduces the number of plugs for the system.  However, not everyone uses this thing with an L1, so it would be nice to include the power supply.  Again, it's cheap enough that it should at least be an available option free at time of purchase if the buyer asks for it, if not by mail order later.  Seems silly to charge for a power brick for a $500 electronic devie that ""REQUIRES"" power.

There needs to be some additional cable anchor points that slide into the slot that the mounting bracket sits in on the back of the speaker pole.  The mounting bracket has one spot you can stick a zip tie or a velcro wrap, but the kit should come with 2 or 3 more of them to slip in lower to keep all the cables nice and clean behind the speaker.  Again, this seems like a huge oversight from a company so focused on sleek, clean appearance.

And finally (for this review anyway), I would LOVE to have a bluetotoh receiver, airplay receiver, and an ipod attachment that could plug into the T1, so I can stream music from mobile devices.  If the receiver devices connects by USB, then the T1 engine should be able to control them.  The iPod could be integrated into the T1 itself, leaving no external connections, and be added as channel 6/7 or similar.

So, all in all, this little box packs one heck of a punch, easily replacing an entire band's rack(s) of processing equipment.  Plus, I bet this thing sounds better too!  Yes it has a couple minor limitations, and everyone has at least one desire they would like to see included, but for what it does and for the price point compared to all that other equipment, this thing is unbeatable, hands down.

What should a ""T2"" have? :
Everything the T1 has
at least 1 more set of stereo inputs (2 more sets would be awesome)
move the USB input function to its own channels not overlayed on 4/5
Pan & cross-Fade functions
bluetooth/airplay/ipod capability (either built-in or accessories) each with its own associated channels

*PS - I would be happy to have the T2 be bigger to accommodate the extra connections of course, but it might also be interesting to have the connection module seperated from the control head, allowing all the mess of cables to be hidden and a single cable up to the control unit which could be the same size as the current T1 unit.  That would allow the T2 control head to mount on the L1 bracket and keep that nice clean, sleek look.  And with the extra inputs, the T2 could actually be a viable contender for a primary mix board AND the processing engine.  Come on Bose, you know you can do it!  Where's my prototype?????",2

I go through the unit and each of the sections and explain what each of the settings do.  The video was produced using this channel strip so you'll get a good idea of the sound quality and what the capabilities are.

If you don't have time to watch the video, it is about a half-hour, here are the main points.

 THE GOOD 

The compressor evens out the volume so it is great for those that don't use a microphone often.

The noise-gate really does an excellent job is keeping room noise out of your recordings.

The audio enhancements take your voice and give it that broadcast ""radio guy"" sound.

Nice, clean gain that will run most microphones.  I'd recommend a Cloudlifter device with Shure SM7B and similar microphones.

 THE BAD 

Does not convert the signal to USB, if you want to record on a PC you'll need another device to convert the signal.

No on/off switch.  I'm using it on my desk and am currently just plugging it in and unplugging it.

 CONCLUSION 

If you are a podcaster or voice-over artist this device will instantly help you create better audio recordings.  Once you understand each of the settings and how they work you can dial in the sound you want.  It does a great job enhancing a voice and minimizing the room noises.  Highly recommended.",2
8401,Good Value.,2
8402,"Very pleased with this guitar.  Purchased from Sweetwater (same price, just faster shipping).
Was playable right out of the box after 2 minutes of fine-tuning.
Simple graphics and oversized inlays were well done.
Wonderful, unique, woody sound from this little guitar.
Smaller size is perfect for keeping handy by the couch.  Picture shows JD compared to my dreadnaught.
The chunky little neck feels 'right' when you're playing it.
Only one guitar strap button (on bottom), so plan accordingly.
Nice size.  Good sound.  Worth considering for your collection.

Per the lack of strap button...I personally like the FretFunk Guitar Strap button over drilling a hole in the neck. - the button strap fits under the strings above the nut and gives you a place to connect your strap easily.
If you want a nice inexpensive soft case - I recommend going with ""Gator GBE-MINI-ACOU Acoustic Guitar Bag"" for $25.  It's not 100% snug, but it is close. Pics included to give you an idea of the fit.",2

8423,"Several years ago I decided to find out just why my G string never sounded mellow like the others and always seemed slightly out of tune and louder than the rest.  I was relieved to find out I am not the only one to observe this.  Just search the net and you can find many sites that explain why this occurs.  The culprit is the unwrapped G string sold in 99% of electric guitar strings.  It was not this way in the 50's and early 60's, they were wrapped just like acoustic strings, but in response to players' demands for lighter, more bendable strings, string manufacturers went to a plain G or 3rd string.  You can bend them but you can not keep them in tune.  Praise D'addario for being the only manufacturer to make the old style string sets with a wrapped G.  I will never be without them.  One try and you'll be hooked.  In tune at last!  Yes, a bit harder to bend but you will accommodate quickly.  Try them.  Take my advise, I am still performing after 45 years of playing.",2
8424,"Light-weight, comfortable and versatile.

The only complaint I have is with the little fuzzy dot sticker they place over the rivet on the suede tail piece to prevent the rivet from scratching your instrument. It does protect it at first, but quickly begins to slip off, defeating its purpose as well as leaving a sticky residue on the instrument.

The company either needs to use better glue to hold the fuzzy dot in place over the rivet or come up with some other solution, like maybe sewing/tacking.using strong thread?",2

8438,"I have enjoyed playing on these strings for about six months, but since I have put them on only one electric guitar of three I regularly play, they have not received a full six months' of use.  After six months, the sound is a bit less bright and the sustain is somewhat damped.  This probably is a result of dirt and some perspiration associated with playing.  Since I have not played professionally in many years, I do not change strings as often and such accumulation of contaminents is more likely.  My favorite strings (Ernie Ball Slinky Cobalt Strings) have remained brighter with much less diminished sustain even though they have been played more over the same time period.  Also, the cobalit strings were noticably louder when first installed and have remained louder over the same period.  This volume difference provides the cobalts with an increased sensitivity.  In fact, I really cannot notice any material deterioration of the cobalt strings.  While a choice of strings is very personal for an accomplished guitarist, I believe others would generally find results of this comparison similar to mine.  Accordingly, I have rated the D'Addario strings with 4 stars because they are quite good, but I have to give the Ernie Ball cobalt strings 5 stars in comparison.  For your information, I used to use the D'Addario strings most often before the introduction of the Ernie Ball cobalts, both in the same light 10-46 guage.",2

8458,These are good in my opinion. The finish is good and parts go together as they are suppose to. That being said I am not one of those guys who slings my guitar around so my review is only good for those type of players.,2

8460,"Nice to have all the tools in one device. Used to have pliers to pull, winders to wind, clippers to clip; but this does almost all of it. Only drawback is the pin puller. Either I don't get it (no instructions) or it's just not well designed. But glad I bought one.",2

8462,"I've been through a few iterations of digital recorders - original Sony Minidisc, second generation Sony Minidisc, Zoom H2, and now this one. This is by far the best - most intuitive menus, nice buttons, and great sound.
I bought this for one purpose: to record directly from the audio out on my synth to the line in to create .wav or .mp3 files that could be emailed immediately without having to go through any kind of conversion from midi. I need to be able to send files to recipients with varying degrees of computer skills so that they can just play them without any fuss. This device is perfect for this. I picked it up at a newly reduced price of 129.00 (B&H Photo - out of stock but Guitar Center matched their price).
I can't address any of the criticisms others have written regarding the mic functions, except to say that this is not a professional piece of recording equipment, so you shouldn't expect it to perform like one.",2

8464,"Anything that can help maintain my acoustic guitars at a proper relative humidity is okay with me. Having had a beloved Epiphone FT-120's neck warp after 38 years taught me a valuable lesson - don't let your guitars get too dry! After buying a new acosutic (a Yamaha FG710S) I decided to keep one of these Planet Wave humidfiers in the case at all times, as they came highly recommended. I use distilled water as recommended and moisten the sponge every 3 days or so as needed. When I'm playing the guitar I put the humidifier in a ziplock bag and store it in the case.
I've had no issues using this humidfier & like it so much I bought one for my Epiphone as well (I'm planning on getting it repaired - as you just don't say goodbye to one of your favorite guitars after 38 years).
Be sure to keep some replacement sponges on hand, and again use distilled water as recommended.",2

8475,"I cant say anything bad about this pick up. It sounds so good! It makes me want to constantly play my guitar just to hear the tone of it. Best neck tele pick up by far. it is a very versatile pickup,  Perfect for blues, chicken pickin country, funk, even jazz! Just roll off some highs with your tone control and you can achieve a pretty convincing hollow body jazz guitar sound.  I've installed this pickup to a 2011 american standard tele. I paired the twang king neck with the dimarzio chopper t in the bridge just cuz i like richie kotzen's tone. Boy im so glad i did that cuz what a difference it made to my telecaster. Richie kotzen knows good tone. It sounds so good! I even went further to copy richie kotzen wiring the bridge and neck pickups in series with a push pull pot. The twang king in the neck in series with the chopper gave my tele a hot mid boost. perfect for leads! Awesome pickups.",2

8479,"The MXR Dyna Comp is a budget Ross style compressor, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great compressor.  I've tried a few compressors that are far more expensive and more highly rated like the Wampler and the Xotic SP.  I didn't like the Wampler and I kept the SP, but I put the Dyna Comp back on my pedal board recently and I'm starting to think it has some special qualities.  I can make the Xotic SP match it pretty close, but I love what the Dyna Comp does with just the 2 knobs.  The Dyna Comp does not have a blend knob like the SP, so that's a consideration, but the sound you get out of one is unique.",2
8480,"These strings sound amazing. the quality of them when first used is amazing. Bright and loud. As the strings get used and used, they get more mellow (as any strings do). But, they still sound great when mellow. I actually prefer the sound of these when mellow.",2

8485,"Bought this so I would have a sustain pedal for my little midi keyboard attached to my computer.  Works like a dream, but should note that this is a full sized sustain pedal.  I was hoping it would be a little smaller for easier transport.  Switch incorporated into the bottom of the pedal switches the polarity in case it is reversed in your hardware, which it was in mine.  This shows up as the notes sustaining in the UP position of the pedal.  Flip of the switch corrected this.  Always look for this feature when shopping for sustain pedals.  Good M-Audio quality construction.",2
8486,"I simply love the tone of the TS808. The crunchy and smooth OD sound just makes me happy. This pedal sounds identical to the TS808 reissue to me. The pedal is super high quality and i wouldn't question it if ibanez said it was made of the same stuff wolverine's claws are made of. It also looks awesome. i recently returned a TS808 reissue because it was defective (picked up radio stations whether on clean or dirty channels... and pretty regularly), so i am now able to compare the two.

if you are set on the ts808 tone like i was, and are comparing the TS808 reissue vs the TS808dx, see below for my assessment for why i chose the TS808dx:

1) True bypass
2) Switches are way easier to engage and feel more sturdy
3) LED lights are bright and easy to see (i thought it was difficult to see the LED light on the reissue)
4) No power adapter chord needed
5) As i found out while i played it: The boost on it is awesome! it adds a beautiful shimmer to it when engaged on the ""post"" setting and more growl when set on the ""pre"" setting. i'll probably always keep the boost on as it adds a lot to my tone (i use the xotic ep booster as my booster).
6) 9v and 18v option: After switching between 9v and 18v numerous times (i have the t-rex chameleon with the two power options), I was finally able to hear the difference between the two. imo, the 18v is a tad louder, more open, and adds a little more treble, while the 9v is more balanced and smooth. I know I'll probably be in the minority, but I like the sound of the 9v more at this time.

Have fun!",2
8487,"Amazon had this priced $10.00 better than anywhere else which covered the tax. The upgrades in Reason 7 are long overdue so it was definitely worth buying even though this isn't considered a major overhaul. The addition of the spectrum analyzer and the mixer channel sub-grouping feature were must-haves. Considering the limited feature additions, the price is fairly steep but well worth having for your work flow.",2

8490,"I bought these strings for use on my son's Yamaha electric guitar.  He tends to break the high E string a lot, and rather than buy full sets and end up with numerous extras of the other five guitar strings, I find it more efficient to buy the high E strings in bulk.

D'Addario is a high quality string and these are a great value.  If you are a guitar novice and are looking for a particular string in bulk, just keep in mind you are probably not going to find ""bulk E strings"", ""bulk G strings"", etc.  Rather you will find them sold by gauge.  For example, for the high E string you would buy 09 or 010 gauge strings, and so on.

I did not rate these strings a 5 for one reason.  I have found they do tend to break more frequently than Ernie Ball strings, thus I would consider that brand a somewhat better purchase.",2

It does a great job playing bass lines to your guitar chords. You can pick from complex bass playing to a simple bass sound. This little box has got me playing guitar like I used to when I was really into playing and making music. Great product Digitech!",2
8501,"This amp sounds great, looks great, works great and is a breath of fresh air from ""modelling"" amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through. This Behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five ""flavor"" settings in each. They are all on one dial and there is no pushing, pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you've switched gears. Here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty. There is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar. The foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar, microphone for singing, drum machine. The EQ sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set. I've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned--it's velcroed on there just fine. The cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material. Plenty loud.",2
8502,"Great tuner! Very accurate, very responsive. I'm not a huge fan of their pivoting system, but it does allow for multiple attachment options and viewing angles. I have four other clip on tuners, and this one is my favorite.",2
8503,"WOW! These speakers sound unbelievable! For the money, they are THE best studio speakers out there. VERY neutral with exceptional imaging and a HUGE sound stage. Every instrument just magically appears in precise locations within the sound field. Amazing. I'd read good things about these speakers but had NO idea how good they really were. I'm sold. They've been setting on some acoustic isolation pads since I first hooked them up, and I have no idea how they'd sound without those pads under them. Not really curious either, but I suppose the pads help a little. I also have an inline tube amp in each channel, with 99/99 balanced triodes (12AX7). The sound is lush and incredibly smooth.

I HIGHLY recommend these speakers to anyone who's either on a budget or just can't justify spending $400 to $500 on a set of speakers. If you haven't heard the JBL LSR305 speakers, you won't believe how good they sound for so little money. I'm not sure it's a plus, but they go REALLY loud too, when you drive them hard enough, but without distortion or any sound of stress. Amazing speakers. I may get another set to use as desktop computer speakers.",2
8504,"For the price, it's hard to go wring with the Caline tuner. The display is big and easy to read. The build feels decent. It's about as accurate as a snark. It gets a reading quickly and the needle doesn't bounce around.

It's not quite as accurate as the Amigo, but accurate enough for general use. The amigo correctly showed strings as slightly off tune when this tuner showed them as in tune.

For this reason I prefer the amigo, but the amigo costs a few dollars more.",2

I mostly fingerpick and needed a smaller gauge string and these fit the bill.  I like them and will probably buy more of them.,2
8508,"I bought these for a project guitar that I built, with plans to replace them later (as funds allowed) with Duncans or Gibsons. However I found that I really like these- a lot.

8519,"Outstanding stand.  Cradles the instrument, very stable with four feet, not three like a tripod.  I chose this design over the many similar ones because the feet elevate the instrument off the floor a bit.  Folded, it's tiny.  Believe it or not, it does fit my tiny soprano Uke, but also my monster Yamaha dreadnaught.  I have two of these now, and my other stand is similar, a plastic cradle by Hola.  These Certain Way stands support my Cordoba La Playa steel string and my Yamaha F335.  The Hola my Recording King Parlor. All three guitars are displayed beautifully in these stands, the guitars standing up apparently on their own without any metal around it.  I can nudge or  bump these stands and all that happens is the instrument rocks around a little bit, but nothing gets knocked over.  Unbeatable at this price.  This is about the same weight as my Hola, but more solid, less fexible.  I give four stars on the stand alone but added the fifth star because of Certain Way customer service, which is tops. I might order a third one; even though I do not need a stand for my uke, it would be cool to see all four instruments line up here in my den, a panorama in 22 strings.

Two months later:  I now protect my guitar even more by putting it in this stand backwards; it rests against the pad only touching the strings and anything that might fly or touch guitar will not damage the top.  Thank you Jim Greeninger for that tip.",2
8520,Very Satisfied with the product which was as described.,2

8522,"This thing fits in a digital world. I get the hesitation and even dislike of yet another thing connected to a computer, that takes more tinkering than just turning some knobs. I get that. I tend to be one of those people. But if you are not -strictly- one of those people, and you have a PC that you are on daily doing the modern human thing, and more importantly you can put this amp near it, or move it close to it without much hassle - then these modeling amps with PC software, really shine. I have this thing sitting in my home office right next to my desktop PC. For me it works right there. My most comfortable chair that is good for playing in, is in fact my desk chair. So this thing fits my life.

Hell no would I want to use this thing without the software. Even with the firmware update that added mid control through holding down the exit button while using the Treble knob, it's not made for classic knob turning.  But there are some seriously great preset tones to be had on the Fender Fuse website. Intheblues has a great '68 tone and a great Clapton tone. There are also some really decent ACDC and Van Halen presets. Download them and drop them into the folder yourself in your Windows documents>Fuse folder. Better than using the import feature. Sometimes they take a rename and sometimes dropping multiple files at a time will lead to some not showing up. Drop it again and it should work. Wonky but this is basic PC software problem solving.

And that highlights that, you know, the Fuse software could be better. But I use a good amount of software and it is far from the worst. After a few hours tinkering with all aspects of my new amp, I have it down pretty good, quirks and all. But people who are not wired for this sort of thing should probably stay away. Or maybe look at the Remuda app for Android and iOS that simply the Fuse software experience.

The Fuse website is also kind of a mess. Broken links and downloads to firmware, etc. They appear to have moved some things like that to the main Fender website but you then have to search for it. Not difficult but certainly not a polished feel after setting up your new amp. The amp has a manufacture date of August 2016 yet came with a 2.2 firmware from 2013. I updated to one from 2014 (still 2.2 ?) but had to download it from the Fender website after not being allowed to download it from the Fuse website.

I will forever be wondering if the Peavey was more my style. The cleans on the Fender, especially the Fender amps, are gorgeous and full. The British crunch is solid and the high gain is just okay. So while you can get solid cleans on the Peavey, and awesome high gain, you kind of pick your poison. But I will always be interested in the overall sound that Peavey offered through their analog technology that is fairly good at simulating Tubes.

That said, I got this as a warehouse deal that sounded like a box that was mangled so they could not sell it at full price. I was right. Brand new in a slightly beat up box for $40 less. I've had bad experiences with Warehouse Deals but this one was great. New, highly featured practice amp for $80.",2
8523,Great for my beginner clarinet students.,2

8525,"Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several ""cheapo"" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.

AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank.",2
8526,"These are the Holy Grail of guitar strap holders. They look really nice, they make it literally a snap to take the strap on and off, and unless you really screw them into the guitar wrong, the guitar will never, ever drop.  They give you two different sets of screws and if they don't work, chances are you can use the screws from your old buttons. I suggest a drop or two of wood glue in the screw holes just for good luck.  And there is always the hardware store where for thirty cents you'll get the perfect screws.  If you can't, give your instrument away  (snark)",2
8527,"I've had digital music keyboards that had options for analog or digital control of volume directly through foot pedals, but my Privia PX-3 doesn't accommodate either solution.  Enter the Boss Stereo Volume Pedal.

Connections are made from the L/R line outputs of the keyboard to the pedal.  Then from the pedal outputs to the amplifier(s).  It works perfectly without any other setup.  The pedal action is just stiff enough so it holds position if you move your foot off the pedal, and the volume limiter knob ensures you won't accidentally cut off all sound.  There is an ""out"" for a tuner but that's not particularly useful for a keyboardist.

Note:  You want the ""low impedance"" version for keyboards - FV-50L.  The FV-50H (high impedance) is for use with guitars.  (There's also a more expensive version with a metal case - FV-500L.)",2

8530,"After kicking over more than my fair share of drinks on stage, I invested in the Vater Drink Holder. To  be honest, this product might be overkill. It's heavy duty construction seems like it's made to hold something more valuable than a beer, but it really is a great product.

Let's review from the bottom up-

-The clamp works pretty easily the black rubberized part on the left of the product image works like a clothes pin. squeeze it and it opens. It can get pretty wide, too. I have a heavy duty hi-hat stand, and it's able to get around it and grab it well.

-The Knob--after you've got the clamp attached to your stand, just turn the knob until it's tight. This does seem to take an awfully long time due to the way the clamp moves. The knob moves smoothly and it's not a problem, just a little more twisting than I'd like to do.

The Arm-- the tiny little arm that goes from the clamp to the cup is legit. It's wider than it looks in the picture (not thicker, but wider). It's also welded together firmly, and it is SOLID. once the holder is clamped and tightened all the bouncing I could do on an old stage with a shaky floor couldn't rock this thing enough to spill a drop.

The Cup-- my first reaction was that the cup was too big. I was under the impression that I could shake the holder, and I was afraid that a beer bottle would rattle and pop out. I was wrong. the cup is big enough that a solo cup will fit, but small enough that a bottle or can won't tip over. The inside of the cup has a felt like textured bottom so that the drink doesn't slide around, and the top edge of the cup is turned outward to help guide a beverage into the cup when it's hiding under your cymbals.

All in all- This is a heavy duty product, but that means that it's solid enough that you shouldn't need to replace it. I'll be buying another one for my practice kit.",2

The display is a bright white letter and the led scrolls across and is green when it's in tune
it might not be fancy, but it works, and it impossible to beat for the price and I did not notice the 'hiss' mentioned in another review, but I am at bedroom volumes",2
8545,Good price. Lock the strap in. Works great. I put these on every guitar I own.,2
8546,"The Digitech Boneshaker kind of surprised me - for some reason (marketing; box graphics; parametric EQ), I got the impression it was a high-gain ""metal""-flavored distortion.  It really isn't.  There's actually only a moderate amount of gain on tap, and the distortion knob doesn't affect gain the same way as your traditional dirt pedal.  But while it isn't the most accessible or traditional distortion pedal, there's also a lot to like here, and I suspect I will like it more over time.

The first thing to note about the Boneshaker is that is has a pronounced low end presence.  It's inherently a somewhat dark distortion, though not necessarily ""muffled"", and you can open up the high end quite a bit with the controls.  Actually, it's worth doing some online investigation as to what the controls actually do.  I still have no idea what ""Depth"" does, though it seems to tighten up the distortion when it is turned down.  A rep for Digitech suggested online that the individual EQ parameters can ""overdrive"" each level of gain if turned up past noon.

The pedal has plenty of output, and even with ""distortion"" turned all the way down, you get a chunky, but clearly gainy tone.  Actually, I found that it cleaned up a bit with guitar volume, and it was possible to do even classic rock and blues with it, despite the off-kilter marketing descriptions of the pedal.  They also promote it for use with 7-string, 8-string, and baritone guitars, but I don't have any of those.  I could see it working well on bass, however.  The middle (small) knobs of each EQ band control the amount of that band, and the larger (outer) knob controls the frequency being affected.  So there's a lot of possibilities.

Still, I did find a lot of the tones to be somewhat same-ish, and it's not the most intuitive pedal to set up and used.  Digitech/Harman ran a sale on this so I did not pay the full $150 price - it would be a little difficult to recommend at that price.  But generally, I'm happy with the pedal and applaud the interesting approach and ""New DOD's"" commitment to try new pedal designs.",2

8556,"My main keyboard which I have had for quite a while is a Roland Fantom S88. I love it, but when compared to other keys, the action is kind of like cinder blocks stuck in mud. So after a time I have adopted a pretty heavy handed style. Every once in a while if I get too aggressive, I can hear a bit of plastic creaking on the M-Audio. But it's been a few months and nothing has broken yet, so short of a hammer, I feel pretty certain its a close to worse case scenario for abuse. I don't know if it will last close to forever, like those keyboards that cost a well over a grand. But for the price, even one year, is one less I have to spend on worrying about getting a main replacement.

For my purpose of using internal MIDI instruments within a DAW and having one consistent playing surface for multiple keyboards, it has worked great so far. From my experience the action is slightly stiffer then a Alesis A6, Juno-G&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roland-JUNO-G-61-Key-Workstation-Music-Keyboard/dp/B000SA89PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roland JUNO-G 61 Key Workstation Music Keyboard</a>&nbsp;and Korg PA80, ever so lighter then a SH-201&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roland-SH-201-49-Key-Music-Keyboard-Synthesizer/dp/B000OY0KWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roland SH-201 49-Key Music Keyboard Synthesizer</a>&nbsp;, and like balsa wood compared to the S88. In my opinion comparable and similar to those keys mentioned, (except the semi-truck keyed Fantom).

The USB cord could have been longer (a lot longer). The advertised programing is really pretty rudimentary in practice, unless you got no other choice and a knack for remembering what the slew of hidden functions are assigned to which keys.

As a straight out MIDI controller, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",2

I bought three of these cables to string between my DMX controller, LED lights and a class IIIb 300 MW laser. Note that because of its power, this laser requires a variance from the FDA, i.e., it is not a DJ toy from your local music supply store. Thus, I require true DMX cables to get optimum output. I've tried using simple mic cables, and they severely reduce the range of the laser and dim the LEDs considerably.

In testing, I strung two 25 foot Ac3Pdmx25 cables together, and am pleased to note that there is NO reduction in performance. You can purchase these cables without hesitation; they work as described, and at a reasonable price.",2

8582,"I have a couple of tuners but none with a tripod to support the neck. So although the tuner is excellent, the cradle aspect has the additional benefit of making re-stringing easier. But, tuning is the main purpose and this device displays increments on its 2 inch LCD screen which permits precise tuning. When the tuner is clamped onto the headstock, there is also an option to tune either by Mic (microphone) or Clip (vibration).

I first tuned my guitar using the Mic mode with the tuner on the tripod in front of me. When I tried the manual tuning technique (making each pair of strings play the same note) I could tell the tuning was slightly off. So, then I removed the tuner from the tripod and clamped it to the headstock and tuned it again in Clip mode, rechecked using the manual technique and it sounded perfect.

Basic operation of the tuner is straightforward. Remove the cellophane blocking the battery compartment, hold the mode button in until the display lights up, select the applicable modeB (bass), V (violin), U (ukulele) , C (chromatic) or G (guitar).

The display works like a speedometer. When a string is played, the note appears on the screen, then yellow bars are for low pitch, red for high, and perfect is when the blue bar at 12 oclock is illuminated and there are no red bars.

To use attached to a guitar, clamp the tuner onto the headstock. For maximum visibility, the screen is mounted on a stalk that bends and swivels at both ends, permitting a wide range of viewing positions to easily check tuning.

To use the tripod, slide the tuner onto the top. The fit snug but loosens after a few uses. What I like about using the tuner while attached to the tripod is that multiple instruments may be tuned without the need to clamp and remove each.  As, noted above I found results more accurate when the tuner was clamped on in Clip mode

If not used, the tuner automatically switches off in about two minutes to conserve the CR2032 3V lithium button battery. I noticed the screen scratches easily, so care needs to be taken while handling and storing the device. Although all plastic, the materials used and the design is sturdy and well-engineered.",2
8583,"Finally, a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated, works well regardless of string composition type,...stainless, chromes, core-types, etc.  The price seems fair enough.  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money, but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast...... get a 'roadie' to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries.",2

8585,"I've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal. A classic that will surely live on.",2

And for the people complaining about how durable it is...lighten up! The thing cost $12 for cryin' out loud! Treat it with kid gloves...watch what you are doing, move things slowly! If I broke it on the first day, I would blame myself and buy another one. Love it!",2
8589,"I recently ordered 4 or these through Amazon and it took several weeks to get them. However, when they arrived I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality.  They were less than $2.50 each and really work quite well.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the plastic end pieces on some were a little oversized which tends to catch on the guitar strings as I take it off the hanger.  Not a big deal at all for me but if someone unfamiliar with this little annoyance grabbed the instrument and wasn't careful it has the potential to cause a problem, i.e., breaking string, banging up the instrument.  This annoyance can easily be corrected by trimming the plastic end cap with a pair of sharp scissors.  They are similar in quality to the hangers at our local music store for a lot more money.  I liked them enough to reorder and I've noticed that this time they are offered on Amazon Prime... 4 for under $10.00.  It only requires one per instrument, but at almost $6 apiece or 4 for $10... I only need 2 more but I think I'm saving money... unless I buy more instruments to utilize the other two.  I suppose my wife can appreciate that risk moreso than your average amazon shopper... or maybe not?  Hallelujah and Glory to God!!!",2
8590,"Everybody who sees this thing thinks it looks great. Then they go to pull a guitar off the rack and nearly have a heart attack. The swings really move around as you're moving the guitars in and out of them. They are sturdy, but it's just a little unsettling how much give they have. They also don't really lock into place very well. It's easy to slide them around on the rail.",2
8591,"Build quality on this strap is pretty low, but not terrible. It's similar to what you'd get on the cheap strap rack at your local music store. It's fine, though - it'll probably last for years (I've never had a strap break on me or anything). You may want to invest in straplocks, though.

The good news: it does pretty much what it says it does, and it I think it is well-designed. I had no trouble whatsoever getting it adjusted to fit my needs, and am curious as to why other reviewers reported problems on this. The weight is now evenly distributed over both of my shoulders, and it makes a real difference! Shoulder discomfort was distracting to me before, but now I don't notice it any more. This strap also puts my bass in a slightly different position than a regular strap in a way I like. It encourages your top strap button (on the upper horn of your guitar) to be closer to the middle of your chest (where the two shoulder straps meet) as opposed to more over on the left side of your body. For the way I like to play, this is an improvement over a regular strap.

This product gets four stars because of the cheap construction. If there were a more rugged, plusher version of this strap (with a little padding, maybe), I'd grab it in a heartbeat. As it stands, I will not go back to regular straps (even nicer ones). The price is right, so try it out!",2
8592,"I am so impressed by Moer's sub $100 pedals!

8594,"One of the better pedals out there and used by many drummers all over the world.  Also happens to have a more affordable price tag than the pricier $300 DW9000 pedal.  The DW5000AD4 has a little more weight to it than the 9000, and switching over from an iron cobra, the 5000 felt like a much more comfortable fit than the smoother bouncier DW9000.  Pearl makes nice pedals too, as well as Tama, Axis, sonor etc. but honestly it's all a matter of preference.  I suggest going to guitar center and trying all the pedals out before making a purchase and just seeing what feels best for your foot.  With the exception of the DW5000TD4 (which you can never find in stores for some reason), I've tried just about every single, if not all single pedals on the market and my foot felt better and performed better on this pedal than the others.  It felt the smoothest, had the most solid build, was the most comfortable for my foot.  I wish the foot board was a little longer sometimes just because I'm used to the length of the iron cobra pedal.  Keep in mind there are 2 versions of the DW5000 -  the AD4 version (this pedal), and the TD4, which is supposed to be a better choice for drummers that play faster beats and aren't necessarily looking for lots of power.  The ""T"" = turbo, ""A"" = accelerator.

Some cool features:
- It has a grip underneath the entire pedal so it won't slip around on hard surfaces and will prevent your bass drum from sliding away too. - GREAT feature.
- the pedal automatically straightens itself out when hooked onto the bass drum.  Sometimes that causes part of the pedal to float off the ground a little but that hasn't bothered me.
- I LOVE the beater that it comes with.  You can use both sides - I prefer the plastic side over the felt.

Not so cool features:
- doesn't come with a case
- comes with a drum key that snaps in to a little place on the bottom red part of the pedal which is sometimes a pain to reach and pull out and put back in.",2

8605,"This is my first fatso-flex cable.  I think I've had Spectraflex cables before, and they've been fine, but I've owned, lost, lent, etc. so many over the years I can't recall.  The look and feel of this cable is excellent.  Seems very solid, but it's always difficult to tell with cables.  I like the flexibility much better than my Monster cable, which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself.  The fatso is nice and flexible, and it looks fantastic.  It sounds fine, no issues.  I'm not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about high-end cables being necessary.  Get something decent that isn't noisy, and the tone comes from you and your equipment.  No issues in that regard with the fatso.

One last thing - you've gotta love Amazon.  I got a 10' red and a 14' violet for ~$15 each, while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more.  So, I wasn't choosey about the colors I got.  THey look great, though.  Oh, and one thing I'm a bit iffy about is Spectraflex's lifetime warranty.  The fine print requires a sales receipt (BS IMO) and says something to the affect of ""we will decide if we will replace it"".  So, way what you will about Monster, but they'll replace anything with no receipt, which is more reasonable, I think.  But I'll worry about that when it's time to worry about it, but it's worth considering, as the return process might not be exactly hassle-free.",2

8612,"Got this to put a guitar I repaired in.  The old case was one of those chipboard cases from the 60's.  They allow the guitar to get bounced around inside too much.  This bag is pretty well made, not a lot of padding but more than the cardboard case it had come in.  In reality, it's almost like a heavy nylon cover that has a little padding as opposed to an actual soft case which usually has more padding and some sort of protection for the guitar's neck which this does not.  It comes with two straps on the back so you can wear it like a back pack as well as a traditional handle on the side.  It has a large pocket on the top side.  I cut a piece of 1"" thick high density foam and put it in the pocket to better protect the guitar's soundboard (face).

I may add a couple pieces of stiff foam in the case to protect the neck as well.  Because there's a generous amount of room within the case, you could probably add high density foam around the sides and back of the guitar and end up with a fairly nice padded case.

For the money, hard to beat. Not enough protection for air travel but adequate for local use and home storage.",2

8628,"This pedal was a solution to one long standing problem. gigging guitarists know the inner battle of carrying gear around : either u break your back carrying 50w amps & cabinets for the best tone, OR u compromise on tone by carrying some multifx processor which sounds like digital sht.
This baby solved every problem & brought pleasure to my ears. the distortion in this is really all analog tube tone, that fat & warm sound we all love from tube amps( far better than the options of some rubbish multifx). Ch1 gives me the whole range of low gain, sweetly overdriven jeff beck sounds to pretty rocking rhythm sounds at full gain. The warmth of the overdrive blew me away, it really responds to picking dynamics of passive pickups. The lead sound of my custom built guitar with john petrucci's liquifire pickups going thry ch1 is sheer heaven, that singing lead sound we all dream of.
Ch2 gives u enough gain to go all the way from dreamy long sustained lead sounds to somewhat aggressive metal rhythm sounds. Even at full gain, the sound is well rounded & musical. it does not become abrasive, it doesnt give u ear fatigue after a concert.
The 3 band EQ helps u shape the tone to your guitar quite well. its a very musical sounding EQ with no harsh or artifical cuts/boosts. The ISF is surely a gem of a feature : u can get the sound of a warm dark british amp as well as the modern tight sound of american amps, & even some interesting inbetween sounds. This means u won't get bored of this pedal anytime soon, there's tons of sounds to be explored in conjunction with the EQ. FINALLY, the most important feature for me is the cabinet simulator. It is really impressive & helps me get rid of carrying heavy amps around. I just add a reverb/delay in front of it & i can just vary the ISF to get a tight fender/mesa sound or the warm woody sound of marshalls. I even recorded a couple of songs with this & i must say that the cab simulator sounded even more accurate thru studio monitors. when playing rock rhythms, it even simulates the feeling of a cabinet pushing air with each palm muted chug ! Try adding a compressor before this unit & u can rockout a crowd with the tightest of crunching rhythms.
Finally, some people criticize the footswitches as being somewhat delicate : this may be somewhat true. the unit has never failed me until now but i do understand that they don't seem to be sturdy to jump around on top of it. but considering all the other incredible sounds from this baby, I don't want to nag about it. I'm pretty sure all kinds of guitarists(other than death metal) would love this unit once its explored fully.",2

8640,These are very well made cords and when you hold and use them you can tell the difference from those cords we used to buy in the 80s. :) I wish they had a 5 or 10 pack.,2
8641,"They seem a bit light wieght but for the price what they have to hold they are great. I did have to bent the legs just a bit on one of them to make the  uke lean back on the stand, but was pretty easy. Fits my mondolin and ukes very well. Would buy again.",2
8642,You must have. It's so simple to use and takes no time to tune.,2
8643,Works as expected.,2
8644,"the best lights eh 100% quality tested

I recommend these lights to 100% for its qualityand great performance on stage. you need to buy these lights 1000% recommended 5 stars.

This review is based on my own experience and I recommend this product for its high quality and cheap price.",2
8645,"Excellent mixer for garage bands, internet radio or Pod-casting. It only gets really hot near the power hookup, needs to be redesigned, rest of the unit stays at room temp. Power plug stays in just fine if you don't step or trip on the cord. Uses a XLR power plug in so any adapter won't do. Well built and portable which is what I need for my needs. Great sound effects. Effects just get more intense or slower or faster as you switch to the next higher number. The pitch just ads a higher or lower over tone to you voice making you sound more robotic or possessed depending on far you turn it up. For pod casting and internet radio streaming plus Karaoke, it's perfect.  For live performances and serious studio recording your going to need to bring out the big guns obviously, don't confuse like some of the other critics. Well worth the money and easier to use than it's USB cousin.",2
8646,"You have too find the sweet spot on your foot when placing it. Also, I found that depending on the shoes you are wearing, it sounds different. Its tight on your foot. It sounds best and feels most comfortable in Chuck Taylors (similar to the picture). I like it though. Once you find the sweet spot it sounds nice and loud. Until then its really quiet and sounds funny. It takes practice. Keep working at it. For the money, its great!",2
8647,"This stand is great. Its light weight and sturdy base when extended to 9ft. It has screws for 8 lights so you can fit any size light on the T-bar. I have an Eliminator Lighting Katana LED, on one side and it takes up about 3 of the screw locations. You can fit a single projector light on this stand if you remove the T-Bar. Pictures show a close up of the screw that hold the t-bar/projector light.",2
8648,Cheap but well made. Great price too! If you need a capo this is the one.,2
8649,The king of distortion pedals.  It's a little fuzzier than I expected with the gain cranked up but this offers a very wide range of distortion options.  I prefer to use it as more of a clean crunch for power chords.,2
8650,I love these picks cuz they never slip from my fingers.  they are the best ones that i have used.,2
8651,Three times thickder than an ordinary rubber washer. They work good on Fender guitars. I haven't tried them yet on a Gibson.,2
8652,"I still carry a Snark for acoustic guitar tuning, but this is what I use in the studio.",2
8653,"Very well constructed. The bag itself, as others have pointed out, is not the best thing ever, but seeing how few pedal boards even come with a bag I'll call this one a win. As long as you're not throwing the bag around it should be sufficient to keep your pedals from getting dented or scratched.",2
8654,nice,2
8655,"I love these straps. After years of using an assortment of different straps I found these. They are durable, comfortable, and have no plastic parts. It's metal, leather and wool.

After a few years of use get some of those rubber washers for peace of mind to keep the strap from slipping off.",2
8656,This is a great mic. Use it for recording mostly it crisp and clear. Captures every sound but only the sounds you want it to. None of that background non-sense.,2
8657,"Very nice, beautiful tone and appearance.  I can play all my favorite Zelda songs on an actual Ocarina!  As a musician, this is a dream come true.  Thanks",2

8661,Large and fits the MXL perfectly.  Way too big for Shure.,2
8662,"I bought these head sets about 18 years ago, and they still work great! I just bought another set and can't wait to use them. I had a pair get sat on and broke the head part, i sent them in and Shure replaced them right away. They are very loyal and i will be a customer with them for ever!! I'm a percussionest, and these work just great. Rio",2
8663,"Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try. For the money I figured why not.

GREAT little tuner. Dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners. This clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use.

The face pivots around and the display is nice and bright. I will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases!",2
8664,It did the trick.,2
8665,Rocky funky,2
8666,"Only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not. but it sounds great as ampeg always has, heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp.",2
8667,"Use it for special church service worship, around 50 people. It works flawlessly and fantastically well. Good range and sound (no lag) is OK. No complicated setup, just turn it on and use. On the con side, the instrument cable is a bit long like other said.

Add-on Comment: The treble strings on my Baden sound a bit metallic and bright but my friend's Martin D series sound fantastic on the same Mixer/Amp setup.",2
8668,Fantastic tone and feel on my Lakland p-bass. Throw these on and put some foam under your bridge and BAM! Instant classic Motown tone!,2
8669,A wound G.  Flat wound.  Love it for slides and mellow tone.  Installed on my semi hollow 335.  Not good for full bends.,2
8670,This stuff works AWESOME. I used on my nearly twenty year old Strat that had at least a few years worth of grime on it. One spray and it dissolved all the crud and it came right off. Definitely recommend this stuff.,2
8671,"Great little guitar tuner with a true bypass. I like how it cuts the sound off/on without any harsh snap, crackles, or pops out of any of my amplifiers when it's being turned off or on. With some other tuners I've had, I would run a volume pedal first in my line and lower the volume before engaging the tuner due to abrupt volume shifts. With this tuner, that's not necessary. I found that when you turn the tuner off to get sound back, the sound gradually ramps back up in under a second or so, without any harsh transition. The small footprint and very easy to read/see display is great.",2
8672,"Really light and grippy, They don't feel like they'll rotate like my other stubby's. I have yet to really chug with them though. Will update.",2
8673,"This mic works very well for what I do which is mostly rap and singing vocals, but I still be recording guitar live soon.. so far for the vocals it picks up very well and clear, and you have three settings to play with for your recording environment. I first had a lot of unwanted ""pops"" and other vocal blemishes it seemed no matter how I adjusted myself to record (close, far, side to side,etc).. i finally got my pop filter the next day with a boom stand and my recordings are crystal! This is my first usb mic but I have an audio technica condenser pro mic and the snowball seems to have better pickup for pc based recording. There is some lag when recording with live listening playback but everything records on cue. I haven't played with the drivers yet to get the ASIO cause I'm lazy and hasn't gotten around to it but this a sound card thing.",2
8674,Very Nice Tuner. This being my 4th Tuner and the best I own. BUY FAR!,2
8675,"I am really impressed with the quality of the tool.  The silver lettering makes it fabulous to read on the black background, far easier than similar tools from other companies.  The FretGuru 2 is a must have if you do your own setups.",2
8676,"Great bang for the buck. Solid case, and hold up very well.",2
8677,Great quality and everything works as expected except that for heavier microphones the feet are a bit too short.  They need to redesign this (make the feet a couple inches longer!,2
8678,Excellent tool for working on guitars. The actual tool probably costs less than the excessive packaging.,2
8679,"Small but not TOO small (slightly larger than Jazz III's).  Long-lasting; pick-scrapes don't chew up the edges like on celluloid!  Grippy, matte, smoothe surface works for me -- no texture, but I rarely drop them.  No flex at all, extra-heavy duralin does NOT move.  Very direct, controllable tone.  And the price is right!",2
8680,GREAT PRODUCT.  EASY INSTALLATION.,2
8681,"This isn't the best stand in the world, but for many applications it will get the job done. The stand has a standard threading that will likely fit whatever it is you are trying to mount on it. In addition to that, the base is wide and heavy so even a mic, shockmount, and pop filter won't put this thing off-balance. The mass of the stand might also be a con though. If you need a stand with a low footprint or you don't have a lot of deskspace, this stand may not work for you.",2
8682,"I play a Epiphone Sheraton II which can be a burden on my shoulder after an hour or so I was in dire need of a padded guitar strap, and not to mention in need of upgrading from that nylon material cutting into my neck. I came across Walker & Williams, and was excited in their quality and selection(s). I ended up deciding on this Distressed Leather Strap and couldn't be more satisfied.

 Quality Leather, thick but also flexible. (Still have to break in mine.)

 Although a little long (I prefer to play with my guitar hugging my chest, Im a beatles lover.) They provide two holes on the thinner end. I loved this, since I can loop them together (I use the higher one) and slap a strap lock on it, and it makes for a perfect cord holder and keeps it out of the way while playing. GENIUS. The length (too long) ended up being not a problem for me.

 The padding on this is just spectacular! Absolutely comfortable, and my shoulder no longer dreads long sessions. I could see it getting a little hot and sweaty, it is a wide strap, but that does not bother me.

Overall, I would highly recommend Walker and Williams to any of my friends, or other musicians I come across. The quality is unbelievable, affordable, and the strap is absolutely comfortable. This company is highly under-rated and can compete in quality over those expensive Levy Leather. I will purchase again with peace of mind. My other thoughts are that I would like to see a less wide version of these, as it could be a bit bulky for some. Appreciate the craftsmanship folks!",2
8683,Great fit and worked as needed.,2
8684,"For the price, there is nothing better, two things that you need to know, 1. The plastic is very thin and it is and looks warped. 2. there is NO volume control on the cymbal, I mean it does not matter how soft or hard you hit it, it is full volume all the time. I have been using it for 2 months now and I hit this thing hard at time. still going strong.",2
8685,"The product itself works great, except if you're trying to capo G-E it starts sliding up and off. But that could just be a neck issue. I for one, don't use it much but it functions how it's supposed to and it's Kyser; they make really good, long lasting stuff.",2
8686,"Perfect fit on my cheap acoustic.
Work as advertised, and seem well made.
After you get locking tuners, you'll never want anything else.",2
8687,Great strings won't have to be replaced for a while now.,2
8688,"I looked at a lot of straps before buying this one, I feel I made the right choice, very soft padded leather, made in Canada not Asia, the width eases the weight on my shoulder from my Precision and Jazz bass",2
8689,"fit perfectly MIM 2002 standard strat. Much better then original MIM block. Heavier and has right tremolo arm hole. I purchased to replace just the tremolo block. Original block has through hole, I was not able to use little tremolo arm spring to fix the arm. Now it works and I guess, it sounds better.",2
8690,Its delivery was very fast and the product was the very one as its ad. I have many condenser mics for vocal and instruments but I am expecting this will be best in quality hopefully.,2
8691,They work.,2
8692,Works perfectly.,2
8693,I had my daughter switch to these from the basic reeds.  Her sound improved dramatically.  Band treacher noticed the better playing immediately.,2
8694,"They sound good, I replaced epi classic pro's and they are clearer and sound better but I expected them to be much better, they are nicer but I'm not sure by how much.",2
8695,"Great instrument, sounds good just hard to keep in tune (but that's the case with any ukelele I think). Looks great and sounds great",2
8696,"This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe.  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge.",2
8697,these are  good cables and worth the money,2
8698,"If you own a 12-string guitar, you already know you need a longer capo for anything below the fifth fret. This capo is longer, beefier, and with a stronger spring than its 6-string brother.

Another less obvious benefit is the stronger spring makes it work better that the smaller 6-string capo. For the sake of intonation and pitch, I capo as close to the fret as possible. When capoing VERY close to, or on top of the fret using the 6-string capo, the smaller (higher pitched) low E string would sometimes buzz because is was not being pressed firmly on the fret (because its big fat twin was keeping the rubber of the capo too far above the fret). The stronger spring of this 12-string model forces both strings firmly against the fret, so there is no buzzing, even when capoing right on the fret.

You won't regret the purchase.",2
8699,"The uke plays and sounds awesome even with my guitar 'fat finger' errors gettin' in the mix! Already had an afternoon of joy and entertainment from this instrument!

Edit after 2 months: I've had tons of fun with this uke and will now be bringing it along to family gatherings and parties I attend because I prefer it for some of the songs I do like 'Bubba Hyde' and Jason Mraz's 'I'm yours'

It's a pleasure to play and always brings smiles to any function when I pull it out and of course people are always surprised you can do REAL music with one of these. Likely the best $53 I ever spent.

I use a very soft .38mm pick and have yet to swap the strings and they still have lots of life in 'em!

What a bargain!!!",2
8700,"Changing a Martin Right handed 12 String acoustic dreadnought into a 12 String Left handed guitar. I needed fret markers. These worked great. Changes the nut and saddle as well. Took off the pickguard.. Now it's a left handed 12 string. These worked wonderfully They adhere very easily, and stay there. You don't feel them when you play. So they are absolutely great.",2
8701,"Fender picks! I have been using them for decades! They are great quality, and they have that gritty sound when you slide them down the strings with just the right amount of distortion. You rockers out there know what I'm talkin' about. They are well priced for their quality and come in a variety of colors and styles that are very nice to look at. So whether you are picking your guitar or your nose, you can't beat this deal! Happy customer here!",2

8709,The best. Pure and simple.,2
8710,Excellent & Koool,2
8711,"This works perfect with the quick release system I also purchased. I mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap. It also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare, or want to put it away without loosing it.",2
8712,"Wow, these are nice and thick and the grip is amazing. I had used the .88 but they were too thin and created flapping for me the 1.0 and 1.14 thickness solves that. If you like a strong grip but want something think give these a try.",2
8713,Loved how it sounds an feels.,2

Barely opened the middle finger and that was it. Been picking for hours and haven't had and movement so far. I'm a 6'3"" skinny guy so large hands but skinny fingers. Large was perfect. Right up to the first knuckle was snug and comfortable. The thumb picks are even better!",2
8716,"Arrived 6 days ahead of schedule (thank you USA EQUIPMENT), and packaged well.

Akin to Ikea, there are no included assembly instructions. However, after scratching my head for a minute, it clicked and went together very simply. If you're curious how to assemble, there is another product review detailing that for you. The locking pins are sturdy and hold weight well, though I am not using them (I have the stands set as low as they can go for the time being).

One thing I will note is that you will want to tighten the screws as tight and hard as possible. Be gentle with the plastic screw-in feet, however, as the head strips very easily. Two allen wrenches are included, along with some extra hardware. I'd still recommend using a foam block to place between the speaker and the stand itself, but getting my monitors off my desk has dramatically improved the accuracy of the sound I'm hearing while mixing and mastering audio (not to mention saving desk space).

There are two reasons why I am giving this four stars.

1. The plastic feet are very flimsy. I was a little disappointed by how easily the head stripped once it was tightened in.
2. Regardless of how intuitive these are to assemble, even basic instructions would have been helpful.

Still, I recommend these to anyone looking. Great price, and perfect for my home studio; they hold my heavy Alesis M1 Active Mk2 speakers quite well.",2
8717,No need to buy those pricy D'addario strings. These Martin's do the trick just fine and cost less. I highly recommend these.,2
8718,Strings are easy on the fingers just a little tinny in sound.,2

8720,"This cable is a great value.  It might not be the best professional cable out there, but for the price it would be very hard to beat.  I've used it for many gigs and when there's noise somewhere in the system it's never me or my new XLR cable.  Two thumbs up!",2
8721,"Really solid and well built, the wife loves it! It was worth dropping more than your average dollar for it. Style and substance. Would definitely buy again.",2

The church is building an orchestra and hopes to have instruments available for people to use if they want to join the orchestra but don't have their own instrument. I kept the stand, method pocketbook and tuner as the replacement horn (the silver , same brand) I bought didn't come with those 'extras'.

The trumpet seems to play well, and the case is really nice. The cleaning cloth is just that - good. But, the gloves are sort of worthless.",2

8731,"I bought this pedal because I needed a drum machine for my Digitech looper on the pedal board.  It is a basic drum machine, nothing fancy.  You can only edit pattern and tempo, but I was pleasantly surprised by some of the effects the pedal has.  If you want a real glassy sounding phase, it really makes it sound like you are in a tunnel.  The sound output of the signal is thin not necessarily as thick as I would like it but for the beginner or just to have a pedal do so many sounds, it is pretty cool for practice. It has a bypass switch and I can flick the switch to a customized setting for special settings if I need a quick crazy, multi-effect sound.  You can't really beat it for the price and sounds, but again, the caution is the signal strength in DBs, it is narrow and thin on depth.  The Reverb and Echo, what can I say, it is not Lexicon or Digitech quality, it has to do with the depth and sonic excellence of those two companies, can't beat their research.  But the Phase, Flanger, Chorus, those are good quality but again, just on the thin side.  For my drum machine use, it is perfect for the looper, PCM quality sounds, and for the quick shift of a crazy multi-effect, that part of it comes in handy.",2
8732,"I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need.",2

It seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it. The blue color is pretty, and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar (case, strap, etc). Other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap. We did notice a scent, but it didn't bother anyone. A more odor-sensitive person might feel differently.",2
8744,Great,2
8745,"GraphTech TUSQ is unlike any other nut material out there. It is a high-pressure laminate material that is easy to work with when using the proper tools. What is so amazing is that the material is actually ""tuned"" for resonance, acting very much like a tonewood. If you were to drop the nut (or any part made from TUSQ or Nubone material) onto a hard surface, it actually rings a note like tonewood does when you tap hammer it. Yes, its a musically sonic material! This allows string vibration to transfer tone to your neck in a way no other nut material can. It truly makes your instrument that much more resonant, and as a bonus, the ""XL"" means it's impregnated with PTFE (Teflon) so it's slippery. Even when cut improperly, string winding don't usually get caught in the string slots due to the PTFE. I HIGHLY recommend getting any nut professionally installed as it will need to be shaped, seated and cut properly. YOU DO NOT JUST BUY A NUT AND SLAP IT IN... IT MUST BE FIT TO YOUR INSTRUMENT!

Hope this helps,

I use it for alternate turnings so I don't have to keep re-tuning my main guitar and slowing down the show. I also found the sound amazing from this guitar. Came out of the box ready to play. Lighter than my LP Standard but still has an amazing tone. Looks nice too, real nice....I get tons of questions on what kind of guitar it is because nobody has heard of OS guitars. Let me tell anyone who wants to get their kid a good quality guitar for under $200, this is a steal and I mean a real steal...don't know how they can make these so cheap and yet not sacrifice too much of the quality. Yeah the tuning heads are lower end and the hum-bucker pickups are as well but these can be easily swapped for  Gibson ones if you want later on down the road. This thing plays real nice right out of the box and is a keeper.",2

I have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the DP-008EX on its own terms, pointing out features and issues important to me (mostly workflow-related) as someone who grew up home-recording with analog equipment.

(If you want all the details of the full functionality I'd recommend downloading the manual from TASCAM or a dealer site that offers it.)

Speaking of the manual I found it to be essential, at least at first. There are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy (or better yet downloading a second copy) is a good idea.
This is picky but I found the larger size of the DP-03 manual easier to read and handle than the smaller DP-008EX.

I've used software-based DAWs for years and, while I enjoy MIDI recording, mixing, and editing with them, basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when I used analog equipment. I have a one-room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and, aside from PC noise, I miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old MK-II cassette 4-track:  Instant power on, press record/pause, ready-set-go.  Granted, I don't miss the `wall of hiss' that plagued those recordings but I had fun capturing a lot of musical moments.

Using a hardware control surface with my DAW didn't solve the problem - I just find the reality of booting Windows, dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment - especially when recording acoustic instruments.

I hoped the DP-008EX would provide some of that older experience - with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup.

The bottom line for me is: It does and it doesn't.

First some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions:

Size-wise, the difference between Porta and Pocket studios is roughly 11 1/2 x 2 x 8 inches versus 8 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 5 inches. TASCAM doesn't provide a case or cover for the DP-008EX but a larger eReader or tablet case should do fine and I'd recommend one if you plan on portable use - the plastic appears fairly durable but it's still plastic.

The knobs on the DP-008EX are smaller in diameter, lower, and have rounded tops compared to those on the DP-03. However, I find their slightly `rubbery' matte finish just as easy to grip. I also find the smaller, circular pushbuttons on the DP-008EX don't protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar-shaped buttons on the DP-003 and are less comfortable to use.

The data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the DP-008EX which I prefer - the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus.

You'll need the dedicated PS-P520 5v power supply for the DP-008EX; the 12v PS-1225L for the DP-03 can't be shared. (The plug won't fit so you can't fry it - and don't even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously).  On the other hand, the Teac RC-3F footswitch is sharable - you'll need a mini plug to phone adaptor - but I think it's indispensable if you're working alone.

Speaking of power, a strong plus for both recorders (and for me a deal-breaker were it not present) is phantom mic power so you're not limited to the built-in stereo condensers. They're not bad for rough work but, unlike mic stand-mounted portables, it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals. I can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good-sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar (acoustic or electric amp), violin, or percussion I want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics.

I like the resistance of the faders on the DP-03, but I can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the DP-008EX. There's no CD burner either on the smaller unit but with USB 2.0 transfer capability, that's not an issue for me.

Having similar XLR, phono and RCA jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste. I'm not  bothered by it because I have space to run the cables but it's worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you.

The LED screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues:

The flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be - especially since the menu is used so much. A slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble:  I do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at 25 degrees and doesn't interfere with jack access - it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use. TASCAM should consider a similar accessory.

The software is largely the same for both units, aside from additional mastering `tools' (essentially packaged presets), and here lies my major criticism: I feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality (i.e. levels, EQ, arming tracks) with dedicated knobs and buttons, and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what I see is an inflexible, constraining menu  system.

If there were some way to customize the menu navigation (the equivalent of software hot-keys) it's possible the frequent repetition of non-functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do.

The best evidence of an unbalanced design I see is the dedicated Phantom power button on both units whose purpose is - to display the ""Phantom"" screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off! That crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software-based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder.

When space for knobs and buttons is severely limited I can understand the design thinking and trade-offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu. But the DP-008EX is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi-tracker, a Fostex X-15, effectively doubled-up the functionality of two tracks to cover four.  So I have to question whether the trade-offs TASCAM made here in fact diminish the user experience.

With connectivity and software-based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving, I believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the DP-008EX will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience. I think TASCAM would be well-served taking that into account.

I've always liked the design of TASCAM gear; it just looks and feels well-made, and that's still in large part true of the DP-008EX. But I can't help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old MK-II cassette 4-track would satisfy a lot of people out there (and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off!).",2
8763,"easy to do, great step up if your short on space,",2
8764,"I own 3 of these, and I use them all regularly. I've used many different capo styles, this is the best. One of mine is about 7ish years old, still works like new, hasn't lost it's grip. Just buy it. If it's under $20, it's a good price. Under $15 is a great price. Do it. Go.",2

Thank you Amazon for selling professional music gear on your site.
I dread the thought of stopping in my local Guitar Center to buy anything.
Anyone that's had that experience knows what I'm talking about.
Received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door.

8785,"Nothing more frustrating than to put on a new set of strings and within a few days (or worse a few hours) have a G, B or High E break. Your then faced with replacing the complete set (ouch), ""borrowing from an unopened pack (not a great option), or digging around for an old string (if your inclined to packrat them for just such emergencies). The beauty of these strings is that they are ridiculously cheap to purchase and while there are several variations in wound string construction for E, A and D, a steel string, for the most part, is a steel string. I've seen some comments that say these strings are prone to fail at times due to twists coming unraveled at the ball end. Even if that does occasionally occur, your still talking less than 20 cents a string. Great for backup replacement or for those really wail on their strings.",2

8789,"I ordered this machine, but a Chauvet 1301 dj showed up in the box. Was I upset? Absolutely not. Im sure the 1300 and 1301 are probably the same thing (overall) but all I can tell you is that the 1301 makes my street look like cops tear gassing a street. Tons of coverage and it still works at this time. Awesome product.",2

8797,I have been using Hercos for for many years. They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification.  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits.

8802,"I love these speakers, they are excellent for the money.  I've done around 20 DJ gigs with them over the past 4 years. I've had them pushed on the edge of clipping for hours on end, and they've never sputtered. One speaker did finally have an xlr input go bad, but that's a $50 DIY fix, and I don't baby these things.one of them fell off the stand and survived a six foot fall to concrete, just a couple gashes and a dent in the grill.  They sound good enough, really good for the price. The punch on drum kicks is excellent and hits your chest.  They're loud enough for dance floors of around 100-150 people alone, 150-200 with my Matching B1500D-Pro sub , and good for 3-5 hundred people for quiet area announcements.  (Yamaha, QSC, EV)

Key words I away look for are ""for the price"" and I am going to use them now. For the price this is an excellent guitar. If it was a little more expensive it still would be excellent guitar. Once you get to the $500 plus then it is just ok. If $200 if you budget and you want to play rock. This is the guitar for you.",2
8808,"Solid cable. I used to buy HDMI cables from Monoprice back when they were ungodly expensive...always high quality and I've never had an issue with them. This cable is no different. I use two of these to go from my Roland TD-11KV drum set to a mixer. Sounds great, and I've had no issues.",2

Its cheap, smells a bit like glue, is more dark purple than black bit a solid sub $100 accoustic clunker.

Update:  3 months of playing and it's still playing great
The tuners are cheap and make me nervous when I change the strings but once it's set up it plays nicely.",2
8812,"What can I say? I like this little thing. I'm a DJ but I don't rock 2 turntables and a mixer anymore. Instead, I sold off one of my precious 1200s and kept the other one for ripping vinyl. That's why I needed a preamp. I picked this one, along with a few others, figuring to audition each one then keep my favorite. This one arrived first, sounds great, and is made in the USA so I didn't even bother auditioning the rest. The volume is nice and loud and I can even run it through my DJ controller's auxiliary input with plenty of volume (probably due more to the trusty Shure M44-7 cartridge that I use). Though it's all subjective, I noticed more definition through the whole spectrum of sound while using this device, as compared to running my 1200 through a Pioneer DJM-450 phono input. I'm half tempted to re-rip my vinyl collection all over again after auditioning this little preamp. Is it audiophile-grade? No, but it's more than good enough for my needs and would have to be better than any built-in preamp in any of the modern turntables available, or even most sub $1500 DJ mixers.",2
8813,Very good,2
8814,"This is a very good wiring actually,  with good quality components and soldering. Nothing fancy just to get the job well done. There's no static nor hums with this,",2
8815,"These strings have comfortable loose feel, but don't have quite as full range a tone as the DR hi-beams. They seem to keep their brightness a little longer than most strings and have a good punch in the midrange. Good 'bite' but not aggressive sounding, on a brightness scale I rate them 8/10.",2
8816,"I've been using this for years with my Oud and now with my Saz (Middle Eastern Instruments).  I recommend this to every musician I know.  This thing is a tank, great battery life, EQ is great. Volume and Gain are great.  Can be powered by phantom power too.
If you play an acoustic instrument, especially one that does not have a built in EQ/Preamp/etc. look no further, this is what youwant.",2
8817,"I'll be darned, it actually works pretty well! This sucker is uber-tiny, but it works like a champ and playing it live through a strat and acoustic amp sound great. Nobody's going to confuse your electric for a Taylor or Martin, but it's totally passable in a live setting and much easier on the fingers if you still kind of suck at acoustic like me. Built pretty sturdy with a metal body and takes a beating. Click is pretty hard turning it on and off and that's the only real issue I have with it in a quiet acoustic setting. Well worth it at 50 bucks if you want to give your fingers a break or just try out a new sound in your setlist.",2
8818,Works well.,2
8819,Fits guitar as expected,2
8820,"I'm a sometime professional, mostly hobbyist.  Why pay more?  That is the bottom line. I've tried a lot of brands and while Rico Royals may not go 10 for 10 in a box without some sanding, they are as close as any others.  And they are still the most affordable reeds around.  If you're looking for a consistent, well made reed, this is the place to start. No question.",2
8821,"The Powerplay P1 does exactly what it says on the box - gives you good level for in-ear monitors.  I used it with a pair of Shure SE215 IEMs and I was able to get enough power out of this unit to play drums and still hear the monitor mix.  It's a no frills, basic piece of gear that just works.  A number of people have complained about the battery cover and I found that I had to remove the black self-adhesive foam strip in order to fit a standard energizer battery in the unit and get the cover to stay on - I have to wonder if Behringer folks have ever tried to actually fit a battery into their own device.  Other than that, no real problems to report - it works.  I haven't used the unit enough times to figure out how long a good alkaline battery lasts yet, but I never go to a gig without a spare or two.",2
8822,"GHS Boomers are the best strings for the price, period...
 The only other ones that I really think are noticeable better are the D'addarios NYXL's ... But they are twice the price and they sound great and all my guitars, except my Startocaster...  I think the NYXL's have a heavier magnetic pull and they create an annoying wobble almost buzz on the g string and I have to lower the pickups considerably low...
 I don't have such problems with these amazing Boomers.... And they don't break easy like blue steel, elixirs or Fender super bullets... These are as steong as the NYXL's.... You can bend with confidance ....  So fot the price , you really can't beat the tone and durability.... But a pack or a box!
You won't regret it... Please don't buy earnie balls, have some self respect.",2
8823,"Very quiet, very nice cables.",2
8824,"This is a really good beginners guitar. Bought for my son as a gift, I find myself picking it up quite often. I own guitars 10 times the price of this one, and keep picking this little sucker up. Straight out of the box it sounded really good...with tuning of course. The tuners are very tight also. The cheapest spot I can see on the guitar this the fret board. By the time any beginner could wear out this fret board, they'd know whether playing guitar was for them or not. I was very happy with my purchase.",2

8826,works as stated.,2
8827,Sounds like a guitar,2
8828,"I have played guitar/bass for quite some time and have used numerous tuners ranging those those big Korg strobe tuners to my latest Sabine STX-1100. I liked the big Boss TU-1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations.
I was at a big jam in a nightclub around Christmas and saw a bunch of guys using clamp on tuners of varying brands and thought I would try one. I looked at the Amazon offerings and after reading reviews settled on this one over the SN1 or SN2.
This is too easy and my guitar has never stayed in tune like this before. It requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time. The only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't really like the E string of my bass. I don't think it picks up those long wavelengths so well. I will try the SN8 shortly and give this one to a friend.

I do recommend this for guitarists because you will always be in tune no matter the tuning. If you leave it on while soloing you can see what notes you are playing. I am my own guitar tech, as well as for a friend, and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thing.
Get a Snark and you will be happy.

Edit - I don't like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to. The only place to clip is the very end and you are fighting tuning keys for space at that point. If you can get it there comfortably it works but nothing like with a Fender or Gibson; both which have plenty of space on the headstock.",2
8829,"Very cool little amp. I like this amp because it allows me to play with or without earphones. The sound on this little amp is really good, you can hear both the highs and lows of the guitar. I highly recommend this little amp.",2

8835,"Normally I wait until I have a product for awhile before a review, but I like this stand so much that I feel ok doing a review now.  I got this stand because one group, that I play in, has all of their music in binders.  Smaller collapsible stands simply are not strong enough.  This K&M stand is made in Germany and is very strong.  All parts fit well and no assembly or disassembly is required.  The only problem I had was in setting up the top section that holds the music.  As noted in other reviews, you have to read the directions first and follow them very carefully.  Personally, I thought the directions were a little skimpy, but my mechanical aptitude is not the highest either.  The top section support long pieces must be turned up vertically and be above the the center wide piece.  The shorter vertical sections must be pointed down.  Only then can you start to unfold the top section.  Note that this step is quite different from any other folding stand.  Take your time and learn how to set up the stand and practice a few times.  Don't wait until 5 minutes before you start your gig.  I will continue to use my lighter stands, but not for heavy music books, binders, etc..Shipping and packaging were fine.  I also bought the bag which is just okay.  Note that there are cheaper stands that look very similar to the K&M.  You get what you pay for and the bolts in the knobs are made from pot metal.  My favorite stand is a Manhasset.  I use them at home and if they are available at gig locations.  They are a pain to lug around though so a good collapsible stand is a good investment and convenience.",2

8845,"About 14 years ago, I had a Fishman Natural installed in my ancient Takamine and was hooked.  It was an all-laminate, beat-up piece of junk, but when I played it through a system, it came to life.  It sounded so much better than my far-superior, all-solid wood Takamine with the built-in proprietary electronics.  It sounded very much like the guitar was simply miked.

Flash-forward to 2002, and I bought a Larrivee, and needed to install something in it.  I picked out the I-Beam Active on the advice of a friend.  The high-end Takamine was long-gone, but I still had the beater.  Well, there was no contest between the I-Beam and the Fishman Natural.  The I-Beam was absolutely unbelievable.  I have never, after playing and hearing hundreds of different setups, heard an acoustic-electric that sounded as true to the guitar as the I-Beam did in my Larrivee.

Sadly, the I-Beam gave out in 2009.  I don't know if it was a fragile unit or what.  I suspect that it may have had something to do with our sound system at the church where I was playing, because we had a power outage, and when the power came back on, my I-Beam was dead.  Weird.

So anyway, the guys at the music shop sold me on a different system.  Still an L.R. Baggs - I think it's an Element.  Let me tell you this:  It's nothing compared to the I-Beam.  It sounds like every other pickup, which is to say that it doesn't sound much like an acoustic guitar.

My advice:  GET THE I-BEAM, even if it only lasts 7 years.  It's worth it!",2
8846,Work just the way they are supposed to.,2
8847,These strings last a long time and have a great sound.  Some of my favorites.,2
8848,"I have both the yellow and red cymbal springs. I got it for my Wuhan china with it's deep bell that would hit the wing nut on a regular stand. While it works well for this, it does have some catches to it. Tightening the screw does flatten the threads on your stand so choose a stand/arm to dedicate this spring to. The plus side to this tightening system is you can also attach it to hi-hat rods. The red spring works great for splashes and small chinas while the yellow is good for rides and large chinas. When using them for crashes the red wobbled like an out of control see-saw. The yellow is too tight which will lead to broken cymbals.

PROS: Felts and nut all in one to simplify setup; Attaches to 6 & 8mm stands and hi-hat rods; Holds cymbals with odd shaped bells

CONS: Damages threads; Not good for crashes",2

I wound up keeping both because this unit is awesome and has all kinds of cool stuff like bass and drum groove accompaniment that you can play along with and allows you to record into it, slow the piece down and practice. At this point I'm nowhere near ready for that so I've been using the mini for practice and once I get a bit better look forward to using the advanced features of this PX5D.",2

I use only one or two straps, so you end up getting a bunch of extra strap locks that may not get used.

The push button design is easy for a quick release if you need to switch quickly, but you can't inadvertently unlock these or have the strap slip off and drop your expensive guitar on the ground.",2

The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I separately ordered this 9-volt Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent. They obviously have changed the design, because the one they sent me is much more compact than the picture. In fact, at 1.5""x2.5""x1.25"" it is a match for the smallest wall-wart adapter I own. I don't see how it could be better. Perfect.",2

8882,"This is a really versatile pedal, it actually can do more than I had originally thought, after some experimentation I found this pedal can do a few things.

It can do overdrive, like I'd say getting into the zone of crunch territory is about where it taps out before getting way to much output going on. It has a unique voice, I'd say it's kind of ""hard"", not harsh, but just a very strong and blunt kind of overdrive. I don't know how else to describe it, to me, this is probably the weakest link in the pedal as it has a tendency to get kind of dark and harder to distinguish the notes the more the overdrive is turned up, but still 100% usable.

The highlight I think this pedal serves is as a ""clean boost"", it has a very slight mid-hump, and gives some ""girth"" to clean notes, it sounds excellent doing this, my favorite setting. It can also be used to push another pedal into some ""output"" driven overdrive, which is a very clean sounding tone, I like that as-well.

That about sums up what the uses are of the pedal, I think it serves really well as an ""enhanced"" clean tone, and even getting into some unique overdrive territories, but I remain that it serves best as a clean boost. For the price though, I'm a happy camper and I think this is a keeper.

Final Notes: This buffer will thin out your tone and add presence when it's off, I ended up returning it because my amp already is a bright amp and it just didn't sit well with my setup. The sound was fantastic, but it made my clean signal to harsh when off.",2

But I have found after using multiple sets of these strings over a year and a half that the hype about the tone lasting a really long time just isn't so, at least not for me. On average, they last under a month before looking and sound rather worn... to the point where I have to replace them again. So I suppose that this all depends on each person's individual expectation of ""3-5 X longer"" hype. By this promotion, are ""normal"" strings suppose to last only about a week or less?

Also, the last set I put on had a ""dead"" G string. It buzzed and sound like it was infused with cotton. After a day of trying it (over the course of many hours of playing), I finally had to replace it.

It's relatively light, and VERY sturdy. It does everything I need it to do, and it's held up quite nicely in both gigs and rehearsals. It's capable of holding a heavy binder without even breaking a sweat.

The only disadvantage this stand has over my previous music stand is that the large flat main piece that holds your music doesn't collapse, so I can't fit that piece into my mic stand bag. Really not a big deal, but worth pointing out. I just carry it separately. But that's minor, the real reason I bought this stand was to hold ALL my music, and this stand does exactly that.

8909,"This Fender Treated Polish Cloth; a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is a
simple product. The classic Fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth. The resealable
plastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read, 'FENPC1' and states it's size as being, 12 inches
by 15 inches.

Well, its size, as I measured it, is actually 12 inches by 14-5/8 inches. Just wanted to mention it
because I have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this. Me, no problem. The missing
3/8 of an inch is a minor detail. Go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s. Now, you won't
actually find any actual '2x4's. They've been shrinking for over 50 years.

I am not sure what this cloth is *treated* with but it does not feel any different than the UN-treated
Gibson polishing cloths I have purchased. I also gave it the nose test. I thought there  might be a hint
of, or a whiff of, some polish or something. Nope. No scent. No whiff.

What I did find disconcerting is the warning in 'Product Details' section on the Amazon web page. It is
the fourth bullet down: ""California residents: Click here for Proposition 65 warning.""  Just thought I let
you know about that one.  Back to the review...

The Fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the Gibson cloths but not much difference
between the two. Well, the Gibson cloth does have a whip-stitch edging around it. Other than THAT, not
much difference.

When I use the Fender cloth on my Fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left. I like to
keep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that. I
don't use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as the
neck.

So, based on the fact that Fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar I will give this
amazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth 4 stars. It appears to do  what it supposed to do,
and that is polish your guitar without harming it.

It gets one less star because of the California Prop 65 warning. I suppose I need to take this a somewhat
seriously so I docked it one star; albeit you'd probably need to use a lot of this product to  develop cancer
but I will definitely be washing my hands right after using it.
.
Note About Vendor: GO-DPS responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time. It was 4 days
past the delivery date. I e-mailed them. They responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail to
me that came in an appropriate amount of time. For such an inexpensive item they went the distance in
customer service. I will use them again in the future.",2
8910,"If you are looking for a reasonably priced drum machine, you should check out the Akai XR20 - it is similar in price range and function to the Alesis SR18, which I also own - three independent ""layers"" of sound creation: a drum kit layer, a ""one shot layer"" (on the Alesis SR18 this is a percussion layer) and a melody layer (on Akai XR20, there are some bass and synth lead type sounds, while the Alesis SR18 just offers bass sounds). The workflow procedures for these units are similar. Supplied documentation for each machine is excellent.

If I had to make a choice between the two though, I would pick this Akai unit - its sound set is much more adventurous and inspiring to me compared to the Alesis, which is more conservative in its sounds (my advice would be to check out the bountiful number of Youtube videos out there that showcase each of  these machines).

I also very much prefer the physical layout of the Akai's finger pads, which are laid out like an MPC - they are also more playable and they light up, making the Akai feel much more like a musical instrument as opposed to the SR18.

Though the Alesis SR18  sounds excellent, if I just want to have some quick  fun creating a beat from scratch and seeing where it might take me, this Akai is what I will grab.",2

So this review is not focused on music.

I did alot of research on different midi / usb devices and the 4 devices seem to lead the way with the Behringer x-touch mini being a major leader.  One from the price $60, can't beat that and having rotary encoders as oppose to limited dials really has it's advantages, so much that it came down to this unit and the Korg.

The two novation devices were solidly built and pretty compacted.  Much heavier and bigger than the Korg nano, but with that also had some advantages with additional 2 extra rows of knobs.  Why I didn't keep them was they were stiff and the size was a bit too big, keep in mind I'm comparing it to the Korg.  Compared to others, the novation devices will suit alot of people just fine, in fact alot of people may appreciate the size of Novation devices as it makes the knobs, sliders and buttons easy to control and has a good solid feel.

The Korg was the thinnest of all the devices and extremely light weight.  Much is due to the fact it's really has a plastic / hollow feel to it.  The dials and sliders wiggle if you choose to do so, so the built is no where near as rugged as the novation devices.

I would of preferred to have encoder knobs vs the regular knobs that Korg has.  This would be the only major flaw in my mind.  With encoders the system remembers the settings for each knob for each photo so you don't have to dial to a pickup point like you do with the Korg.  It really would be nice to have, but I'm sure I'll get use to using the knobs the way they are.

The other downside is compared to the other 2 devices within this category, this was over 2x more than both the Behringer and Novation Portable.

Now the upside to all of this.  It's small and light.  Can run wirelessly, No Cables, a big win!  Runs on 2 AA batteries in wireless mode. You still have the option to run it using a usb cable, so you don't have to have batteries.  One thing to note, it uses a micro usb cable which to me the connection is small which may be prone to breakage, I'd rather of seen a normal USB port, but it speaks to the thinness of this device (a little thicker than a macbook pro)

The biggest win for me was the fact you have 5 banks to program.  Most of the others only had 2 banks.  This means I can have the following:

40 sliders (8 * 5 scenes)
40 knobs
160 Buttons (8*4*5) + 60 (12*5) Additional on the left side
Plus a jog wheel

There's no device I saw that came close to having this many options.

I've included pics of my current 5 scene layouts, but I will be modifying these with presets and additional commands.
Still working on the best layout for my style of workflow.

One thing to note, the instructions are pretty bad.  If you want to connect wirelessly, you have to install additional korg software that somehow pairs up the device with your laptop.  Not sure why that's required, but once I did that, it works like a charm.  In fact when I turn the device on, the software prompts me if I want to connect.

Using this with a Macbook Pro and midi2LR software which is a free program for anyone interested in doing the same for their lightroom editing.

The width of the device is as wide as my keys on my keyboard on a 15"" macbook pro.  The footprint is just a bit bigger than the keyboard, from the monitor to the top of the touchpad.

Again, not sure what kind of beating it could take, ie. if it falls, I could see the plastic housing cracking, but I do like how light it is.  Being wireless and so many program options, this was a pleasant surprise.  For some the buttons and knobs are small, but you get use to them and they are well spaced.  At $150, most may opt for one of the $60 units, or as some on youtube have 2 of the $60 units running, but to me that's twice the wires and devices, this one handles more than what 2 of those units do and in less space and weight and without wires.  For a roadwarrior, this makes it better.  Now I just have to find a case, although the box it came in isn't too bad for now.",2
8919,Is what it is....Just make sure you get the right size or all is for naught.,2
8920,"Works great!  It comes with a metal clip that helps you space it the correct distance away from the rim while lining it up with the tension rod.  Obviously you need to finger tighten all of the tension rods, then give each rod one full turn using the star pattern.  From there, I press down on the drum head with my hand to get it properly seated with the drum.  That's when I started using the DrumDial, tuning in a star pattern to avoid warping the the drum.  Once I get every tension point at the same tension reading, that when I start tuning by ear.  Using this has cut my drum head tuning time down by half as I'm spending less time tuning by ear.  It comes with recommended tuning settings for different sized drums.  These are a good starting point but you will still need to tune by ear to make sure you're not getting any overtones and to get the pitch you want from your drum and drum head. Definitely works as intended I'm glad someone thought of making a device that measure drum head tension.",2
8921,"If you don't know what type of pick you like, buy a sample pack. Picks make a big difference to sound and playability. These are thin and flexible.

8926,"I evaluated the Jo-Ral Copper Bubble mute along side of the Harmon brand Copper Wah-Wah (or harmon mute).  I use the mutes in a jazz quartet as well as a larger 7 piece jazz group; playing everything from jump blues, jazz, soul, r & b, and funk.

What's the same:
Both are heavy copper.
Both have a nice traditional harmon mute 'bite' and edge to the sound.  I would categorize the Harmon is 'crisp', while the Jo-Ral is 'dark.'
Both are made very well.

What's the difference:
The Jo-Ral plays with better intonation throughout the range of the horn; the Harmon is much more sharp in the lower range.
The Jo-Ral plays with much less resistance than the Harmon. This is a major design difference in the mutes--the Jo-Ral is rounded, while the Harmon is more angular. Over the longer gigs, this can make a difference. For me, I'd rather have the equipment work 'for' me than not.
The Jo-Ral is bare copper, while the Harmon is clearcoated.  Over time, the Jo-Ral will tarnish, while the Harmon holds its lustre.  If this is important to you, get a can of Testors Clear Coat and spray it with 1 or 2 light coats to preserve the finish.  If you use a heavy layers, it will affect the sound.

Summary:  Both mutes are made well and have a nice sound.  I rate the Jo-Ral higher for better intonation, and less resistance while preserving an authentic feel.
If you want a brighter sound #along with less resistance, and good intonation#, go for the aluminum version.

  My HW03 arrived today, here are my first inspection comments.  This one did not have an adjustable bridge, that's ok, the bridge is like the one on my Martin D35 and all of my other acoustic guitars. I need to sand (250 grit) off about 1/16"" off the bottom of the bridge being carful to keep it flat (you can try to rock it on a known flat surface after sanding, it shouldn't rock.  Also the nut is too high, I believe this is why some say these note out sharp when you fret it.  So I scorded it with a sharp point where the headstock finish meets the nut, then tapped it with a wood chisel from the fretboard side and it popped off easily, I will be sanding its bottom also, about 1/16"",  The fret board-neck is not perfectly straight but looks workable, trails down after the neck is on the body, just a very little, so that shouldn't cause any buzz or anything.  Will check for high frets, level if needed and then masking tape and polish them with 1000 grit wet/dry sand paper and 4/0 steel wool.  If these changes help out, then I will replace the nut, bridge and string pegs with bone and I think have a nice parlor guitar.  Sounds pretty good with CHEAP strings tone wise, if you like that cheap Blues Guitar kind of sound, exactly what I was wanting... Love the size, it fits nicely sitting in my recliner playing a little fingerstyle blues and with this little work should play as well as any other well set up guitar. Or you could pay someone at a guitar shop to do this and they might do a good job,,, or not.  It is not brain surgery, takes maybe an hour after you have your supplies and tools most of them you probably have or can borrow and it gives you a great feeling of accomplishment when someone goes on about how well your guitar plays.. Watch a guitar setup on youtube..

8934,Satisfactory for the money.  Good enough for beginner.  Too large for a child or teen.  Meant for an  adult student.,2
8935,I have heard that it doesn't matter what Mic cord you buy since they are all the same. So I ordered the cheapest I could find and this chord has worked just fine for me thus far.,2
8936,"I have grown to love Evans heads even though my friends all play Remo. I love how they fit, sound and really take care of some problem drums. I had small Sonor German Made Snare that just was hard to dial in and this head worked very well, it now sounds louder than my pork pie snare.",2
8937,Love it! My no 1 practice amp.  I like how it'll supply 9 volts to your pedals and the aux in,2
8938,"Can't beat it.. For the price this light is small but packs a punch .. Has good coverage, brightness and built well. No problems yet.. Even the mic sensitively sensor works decently better than other lights. Light does get very hot and should be cycled every 30 minutes or so. But i like it for the price till I can afford LEDs.",2
8939,"The only strap buttons and locks I use. Easy install, great look, and these things will last a lifetime.",2
8940,"Very good, we'll made simplicity.",2
8941,"Pretty much mandatory here in the high desert of Colorado, it's great to have at-a-glance numbers of inside your case. Attachment however...that leaves a lot to be desired. Seems like no matter what sort of Velcro or nifty metal hangers and magnets a company includes, these things just don't stick in any of my cases.",2
8942,Man do I love these strings.  they sound wonderful and are easy to tune and hold their tune well.  I love the rich tone.  One thing though.  They are not as tough as steel strings.  I damaged one string because I tend to allow my nails to touch the strings.  But not to worry.  if you don't damage them to bad they heal themselves pretty quickly provided you keep your nails trimmed short.  That having been said.  i love them and highly recommend them for anyone who likes a really deep mellow tone.  Thanks Thomastick,2
8943,"Although I already have a soprano plastic uke I thought it would be cool to own a concert size which hopefully would bring out lower tones and more of a sustain as well. The kealoha more than met my expectations. The intonation is pretty good; accurate up and down the neck and handled being restrung with a low G string quite well. I used a wound guitar D string and was very pleased with the overall balance in both strumming or fingerpicking. It didn't come with a gig bag but fortunately I have one I can use (unfortunately for Kealoha it has another brand name on it). Still, I love the black with stars and stripes which makes this ukulele a totally unique addition to my uke collection. Mahalo to Kealoha.",2
8944,"Great, rich sounding claves!  You can definitely tell that they are made of good quality.  You can also tell a difference between these and cheaper ones. I cannot wait to use them at music festivals this summer!",2
8945,"Delivery was right on time. This little peddle is built like a tank! Works great, quiet, no hiss ,no hum
Direction sheet it came with tells exactly how to operate it,footswitch is smooth and accurate.
Fidelity is also accurate.lve been using it with a custom built tele with my own special design
P90 style pickups,using a clean tone these pickups have really deep tight low end. And  airy high end
And this looper reproduces it very well. For the price it's amazing!",2
8946,"not cheap stuff and not professional, but great for gigs and live play
great price and durability will buy again",2
8947,"works fine, no noise at all.",2
8948,Excellent,2
8949,Pretty damn nice.,2
8950,"Good quality, as advertised.",2
8951,"My favorite pick.  I love the size, hold and feel; it feels very natural in the hand.  I sand the tip surfaces and edges with wet 2000 grit paper for a smooth takeoff.  The sound from these picks is very natural and warm compared to nylon.  It even takes the ice pick off my Strat.",2
8952,I like it that it fits well on my strap and that it has a good snug hold on the receiver,2
8953,"Really good, I love it.",2
8954,Pop filter that works. Double sided filter feels like quality.,2
8955,"This works great. It's light duty, for tap in my gift bag, and has variable Heights. Or use it all the time.",2
8956,Remarkable instrument huge range of uses.  Achieving perfect intonation is not easy.  Wasn't on original I owned either.  Get used to avoiding the upper range on your E-A-D strings.  Bass players will need to adjust to new fingerings to compensate.,2
8957,Worried it wouldn't fit my c-iu Behringer mic.  Worked fine.  Strong construction.,2
8958,Sound amazing for the price.,2
8959,A good choice for me. An excellent electronic musical instrument that makes sure the instrument performs well for the artist,2
8960,These work great and look even better than the originals!,2
8961,"Simple, no frills, stand.  Only problem I've had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off.  A lil' glue will fix it, just haven't had time!",2
8962,Great! Came as promised.,2
8963,Exactly what I needed to adjust the truss rod in my Martin HD-16RAdi. Hope I don't have to use it again for another 3 years.,2
8964,"Very good, I like it.",2
8965,"Great little tuner, very convenient.  I purchased this to mount on a Taylor T5z and a Martin D-15.  Not perfect fit.  The taylor headstock has only one mounting option which is at the top of the headstock, and the Martin only fits right above the nut.  Note: when received, one unit had a damaged lcd, and amazon sent me a replacement right away.",2
8966,"This is a simple, one knob reverb pedal.  BUT - the ""TonePrint"" technology makes it really versatile, and a LOT of fun to use. I use it on a ""mini"" pedal board if I am traveling light.  It's a good, solid pedal with a huge range of options.  If space is an issue, this is really strong solution.",2
8967,"Highly recommend for guitars, ukuleles, and any other wooden i instruments. Does not dry out and damage your wood like lemon oil that is very bad for unfinished wood.",2
8968,"This product has been a real pleasure to use and it tracks very well. I have the older model with a sabata and it performs just as well . The bottom is smooth and the highs are accurate l use a pro-jet phono preamp and it another 20 db.  boost , my recordings to cd sound great. The cost was a little high but the 140 gives my denon 110 mc a run for the money.  Good recording.  Mph from long beach",2
8969,Decent cable,2
8970,"Let me be clear...this amp is probably not a high-end unit. But so far, I can't find a thing in the world wrong with it. It's powerful and plays with good quality.

I put this side-by-side with a Behringer I-Nuke 3000 for comparison. The Behringer is a pretty dang good amp! The two amps have very similar power and audio qualities, which is a good thing.

Time will tell as to the reliability of the unit. But so far, it looks to be one of the real bargains in pro-audio amps.

I will try and follow up after I put some time on it.

Good listening!",2
8971,"I am very happy with this chinrest wrench. It's size is perfect for working with the screws on your chinrest. I used this wrench as soon as it arrived. I took off my plastic chinrest and replaced it with my brand new jujube chinrest. It worked perfectly. I didn't have to worry about scratching the wood on the violin. This tool will last a lifetime. I am VERY, VERY happy!",2
8972,The only sticks I use.,2
8973,"I like the tone and slightly larger bore size fits my hand better! It also is loud. For the price out of my other 6 whistles, this isy best and fav!",2
8974,Excellent workmanship!!!,2
8975,"Well, ok, so I found a guitar in the neighbors dumpster. Pickups were garbage. Picked these up on the cheap, and they're much better quality than was in my dumpster find. They don't quite fit the cavity, so I will need to dremel. Wah. Not bad little no-name pickups.",2
8976,"These last a long time, tone is fine, and have had no problem with breaking.  I've only had a few strings break in over 10-15 years of using Elixirs.  Very durable.",2
8977,Does exactly what it says on the box and without any dropped messages. Very sturdy build which will hopefully last for years.,2
8978,"I've used EXPs for several years, on several different guitars. I play mostly folk/rock/blues flat and finger-pick styles, and these strings lend themselves very well to those genres. Lively and easy to play, they sound good whether being played with any attack from the lightest imaginable finger-style to hammering away with a moderately-heavy pick, and hold tune in the process.  The coating process does seem to help them keep a ""new strings"" tone longer than the uncoated D'Addarios I switched from. They have the bright sound characteristic of 80/20 strings, and I appreciate the company's use of minimal packaging: an outer cardboard sleeve and a single inner plastic envelope.",2
8979,"Small and lightweight, good product, must be treated very carefully.",2
8980,"My eclectic taste in music ""force"" me to keep 4 overdrive/distortion pedals, 2 delays, 3 modulation pedals, a pitch shifter, a wah and an expression pedal on my effects board. The funny thing is most of the time my signal is pretty straight forward and dry.

For years I have relied on plywood pedal boards to drag these pedals around. The problem with using wood is, wood that is too light will eventually break. When you start constructing with 3/4 plywood your board can get heavy quick. The smart alternative is to buy an aftermarket pedal board, I suggest you first look at Pedaltrain.

Where Pedaltrain has plywood and other off-the-shelve pedal boards beat is their design. Other off-the-shelve boards are just that, a board with a power supply not much different than my plywood contraption. Pedaltrain uses lightweight aluminum for its design, I was able to pick up the Pedaltrain Pro with a single finger.

Pedaltrain not only has taken care of the weight issue but also the cable clutter on you board. To gain even more pedal board real estate you can purchase a power supply to mount out of the way on these awesome boards.

The Pedaltrain has room underneath to house many power supplies including the Eventide PowerFactor. The Eventide PowerFactor has 10 outlets configured in 8 isolated sections. You can additionally power up to three of Eventide's award winning stompboxes with the PowerFactor. Making this even more attractive is Eventide's 5-year warranty on the PowerFactor. With my power now under the board I now have room for extra pedals.

Pedaltrain gives you two options for protecting and carrying you beloved pedals. Pedaltrain boards come in a tour ready road case or a heavy duty cordura nylon gig bag. The gig bag
not only carries your Pedaltrain but also has a pocket to carry your additional accessories. The cases also keep your pedals protected and dust free when not in use, protecting your investment.

Pedaltrain has boards in a variety of sizes. The 21x7x1 inches Pedaltrain Mini has a street price of around $69.95 with the cordura nylon gig bag. The mini is great for those of you with just a few pedals. I am planning on picking up a Pedaltrain Mini for my ""jamming"" board that has 3 basic pedals on it, tuner, overdrive and delay. The ""big boy"" 32x16x3.5 inches Pedaltrain Pro has a street price of $159.00 with the gig bag. The Pedaltrain Pro has become part of my gig arsenal.

Pedaltrain is all upside. This is the last pedal board you will have to build or buy. Solid construction, easy cable routing and the awesome gig bag make this a must buy for you pedal junkies",2
8981,Works,2
8982,"These are the best strings so far for my Ibanez AG95, full hollow body electric. My guitar originally came with EXL-140 light top-heavy bottom (.010-.052). These however give a much more even tone and also sound better acoustically, un-amplified for practice.
Most jazz guys go with flatwounds including the 3rd; but as I am sometimes defying genres so these work well for me.
I play both jazz and rock so having the plain 3rd for bending is a boon for rock.
I recommend these for hollow and semi-hollow arch tops. whatever your style.",2
8983,"I used D'Addario strings since the day I started playing guitar, fast forward several years later and here I am still using them. They have excellent packaging, easy to follow color coded ball ends (not to mention iconic too!) and overall reliable performance. Sure the NYXL's seem to be a bit better, but they are priced higher and in my opinion, the increased output of those strings aren't really worth the extra cost. I will be sticking to my trusty EXL120's for years to come, I put them on all 3 of my guitars, one of which has a Floyd Rose tuned to E-flat and two of which have standard Strato vintage trems and they all perform perfectly. After all these years I have yet to find any fault with them.

Keep calm and buy D'Addario!",2
8984,great sounding reverb mini,2
8985,definitely works. i love simple equipment.,2

8992,"Took a while for these connectors to arrive, but the price was excellent and they work well.",2
8993,These strings are really great for my roscoe bass. They really bring out the tone and growl. The price was right. Thanks Bassin J,2
8994,I made a cigar box guitar and this item was instrumental in allowing me to play the guitar with ease. It was delivered in a timely fashion and was just what I needed.,2
8995,"Can't understand why anyone would be the kind that needs to be switched on.  (Don't bother to tell me; I know.)  Great tone, lots of flexibility, nice smooth action on the wah.  I've been hooked on this for 20 years--just replaced the old one that finally ran out of springback.  Can't complain; got my money's worth out of it.  I've had quite a few friends try it after using the conventional kind with a switch and they all loved it.  If you like the CryBaby sound, give this one a try.",2
8996,Ernie Ball and DR for life!!!,2
8997,"Hercules has long been making quality musical instrument stands and accessories  I've used several of their guitar stands over the years mostly for the acoustic guitar on stage and in the studio. Recently I tried out their mini stand for the electric and subsequently acoustic guitars. They are excellent as one would expect from Hercules. What I like most of all is the ability to simply fold it up and stick it in a pouch on your gig bag...! They travel extremely well. I plan to keep using the other hanging style around the house and studio and likely on stage as well but these mini's are perfect for everything in between. Try one, you'll be sold.",2
8998,Needed to oil the fretboards on my ukes.  I apply the oil with a micro fiber towel.  It does not take much but really makes the fretboard look good.  I do this on a routine basis to keep the wood in good shape.,2

It kept me busy when I got board and had the urge to play some keyboard. I like it, it is serving its purpose for me. Might even get my parents and brother playing because I'm leaving the keyboard with them.",2
9003,"Love these tuners very high quality, I've used them on two builds now never had an issue, they look and feel great turn smooth and will hold your tuning for ever.",2
9004,yuppers! this is the only strap locks i have used that i can give an honest 5 star rave review on. Dig'em.... really dig'em man!,2
9005,"Good cheap basic metal slide, sounds like it should. Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands (viz XL and XXL gloves) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger. A bit annoying but not the slide's fault I guess!",2
9006,Great sounding chorus!  Lots of chorus options.  Built like a tank!,2
9007,Seem like a good gig bag. Barely fits the bass uke I got it for.  Happy so far,2

9009,"Plenty of room on this board for the pedals I need to carry. I use more ""boutique"" sized pedals than Boss-sized, an this three-rail system makes reconfiguration easy. Plenty of room under the slanted rails for my power supply, too. Case is more than adequate for local gigging musicians. Perfect.",2
9010,"These cables work very well.  They are very soft to the feel, so I'm hoping that won't shorten their life.",2
9011,"My violin sounds great now, and I prefer these over the Pro Arte we had used before. Also I don't hear any problems with any high pitched squeaks on the E string now that we are using the gold Pirastro. Excellent value!",2
9012,"I have years of experience both as a professional musician and pro DJ and know very well that a faulty cable can shut down your whole system. I was in need of several 50 foot XLR cables. Prices for such cables range from the low end generic options ($10) to the high-end name brand ($75+). For me, neither option is a reasonable choice because the extremes are either poor quality or over-priced. I was looking for a cable that was reasonably priced with excellent strain relieve at the connections and was sturdy and flexible without being too thick. I took a chance on the Aurum Ultra Series and was totally pleased with the purchase. This cable checked all of my boxes. Highly recommended.",2
9013,Easy to setup and works great.,2
9014,LED stand lights used to be extremely expensive and hard to locate. This humble stand light is just as good as yesterday's special-order custom job costing over $100 and has the added simplicity of taking AAA batteries. The two different light levels are perfect and the maximum level is brighter than most plug-in lightbulb stand lights. My only complaint is that the power button is too easy to activate and it has drained itself once already inside my clarinet bag.,2
9015,First time buying these and they sound great. Really brings out the low end.,2
9016,Came on time and was exceptional.,2
9017,thanks worked great I return I will do business with you again what I expected I can recommend to get on time and as described,2
9018,I was happy to find strings for my Bass guitar less than the music store price. It ain't cheap to keep fresh strings on the guitar.,2
9019,Bought this for my 12 yr old daughter that is just starting to play violin. I was very pleased with this stand. It's great for home use. For the price I was happy with the quality. It's not a high end music stand but it is adjustable and pretty sturdy.,2
9020,"I never have gotten along with delay pedals, echo boxes etc. Owned quite a few over the last 40 years. This is the first one I am excited about and use all the time. It is due to the Dynamic setting. I now realized that was my problem all along, I needed ducking. While you are playing, it is clean sounding (just a hint of delay), but trails the delay after you stop.  The Reverse is cool too. Yes, it really reverses the notes. Play a run and it gets reversed, crazy and fun.  If it is not true bypass, it certainly sounds like it. I am a true bypass parishioner.  I just sold my Boss Tuner for a true bypass one due to the sonic degradation, no matter where I put it, first or last in the chain. The TC Nova delay does not suck any tone, could be true bypass or not, I don't know. All I do know is it sounds like true bypass for real.  The only thing I don't like is the scrolling thru the presets via the tap/on/off buttons. I always manage to change the delay time instead of the preset. Then I have to manually retune the preset delay time to get it back. But sometimes the preset time comes back when I scroll thru the presets. I guess I am a little challenged in that area. Otherwise, GREAT delay pedal. And price extremely well for what it does.",2
9021,Easily adjustable and very comfortable,2
9022,"Was the cheapest and most efficient sling I've seen on the market. Even some 30$ name brands I've seen didn't have a felt inlay on the clip protecting the body of the instrument. This one does and for this price you got grab one . Holds my ukulele great , no slippage and is very gentle on the face of the instrument . Good for guitar too.",2
9023,"I have installed Dunlop Straploks on all my guitars.  After an unfortunate ""drop"", I would highly recommend protecting your investment with these strap locks.  A little drilling involved for install on Les Pauls (the front button by the neck, not the rear button near the back of the guitar since Gibson uses 2 different screw sizes for the strap buttons).  Use caution when installing so you don't drill the hole too wide and need to fill with wood putty.",2
9024,Works Great for sharp fret ends,2
9025,"I have used this successfully on my Win7 machine wonderfully.  Low latency, consistant work.

My original review (when I couldn't get it to work) follows:

This simple, generic device was connected to:

Mac PPC (Power PC) running Mac OS X (10.4.11)
and
Acer laptop running XP PRO

I was using Garage Band for the Mac and tried a few things on the PC.

This device would show up in the list of devices for the Mac.  It was completely invisible to the PC.

I am no stranger to working with computers and music applications, this was a tough one.  When I have problems with a USB device, I cull its ID number from the USB identifier and search for drivers, the source company, etc...  The ID number on this device belongs to two other products (humm, that's strange) and they are very different functions but appear to be from the same Chinese manufacturer.",2
9026,"A lifetime of hard use will not wear out these babies. They are solid and durable. The excellent feature is a hole for stringing on a necklace, (small) keychain, or hanging strap thong. That will make them harder to lose, though not impossible. Incidentally, these have sufficient radii to facilitate all the torquing anyone could reasonably require. You can ""power on,"" if your axes require it. Just be prepared for superannuated Melanie fans to tell you about their ""brand new pair of roller skates,"" while you smile cognizantly and the mystified puppies in the percussion section ponder quizzically. These come with a good grade of plating, comfortable feel, and decent balance.",2
9027,"Good quality, sounds good on my recordings. Claves are a very important percussion instrument and these are a fine example.",2
9028,"These are good, firm reeds.  Great for intermediate players; seem to minimize any squeaks, especially with quality ligature.  Individually wrapped in addition to usual plastic holder.",2
9029,"Super sturdy, I can attach my tablet music holder, and another stand to hold my drinks and harmonicas, capo, picks, phone, etc without worrying that it will tip over like my previous stand did.  Purchased another extendable boom on advice of another review, and it helps extend it so I can use when playing Keys, as well as guitar.",2
9030,Works well and looks great,2
9031,Really great and easy to see even at a sunny outdoor gig. My only gripe about it is that you have to hold down the button for a hot second (or 3) for it to turn off and on...not a big deal. I'd still recommend it over the snark even though the snark is instant on/off. This little guy's bright screen helps in many situations to get an accurate tuning. -Zack David,2
9032,Great quality!,2
9033,"This bundle will save you soooo much money. And if you're an artist, you need to save as much money as possible.",2
9034,"As many have said, this is indeed a nice capo. It is easy to put on and adjust with one hand, I think, and the tension is fully adjustable by how hard you squeeze the capo onto the neck of the guitar, so you can clamp it just hard enough to fret the strings and not go too far out of tune. Everything about it feels very solid.

However, because the tension is adjusted only by how hard you squeeze it onto the neck, I find it hard to know if I've made it tight enough without playing the middle strings (which seem most likely to not fully fret). This could be awkward if I put the capo on and start playing and get buzzing on the strings because it's not tight enough. I've only played a handful of sets with it so I'll probably get used to it more, but I'm a bit torn whether it's worth the price over a basic Kyser. I'm curious about the G7th Newport which seems to have a tension knob in addition to a squeeze mechanism, maybe I'll give that one a shot.

Second downside, you can't do any partial-capo stuff with this. I tried a drop D capo, but the bottom part of the capo won't seat right and it falls off easily. Another win for the Kyser which can handle an easy drop D capo as well as turn upside down and use the back of the capo to fret.",2
9035,"I've owned this amp for over two years; here's what it's gone through:

Thousands of miles in the trunk to dozens of gigs each year.
Dropped from a 3 foot height
Solo gigs in coffee shops as the main sound (Vocals, guitar, and, uh, bodhran)-loud enough for  small venues
Monitor amp for guitar in large venues

Sound Quality: ***** This is the best sounding amp I've ever owned. Fishman does...something better when your pickup hits the amp. I have an older Highlander pickup in a Martin HD28, and it sounds beautiful through this amp (though not quite what you'd get just 'mic'ed' up). Vocals sound clear. Tone and effects are exactly what you need for a solo show.

Durability: ***** Works 100% of the time; phase button flew off at first gig and disappeared. Still works. Band mate dropped it off the back of the van. Fell apart like a small bomb went off. 6 screws and a bit of wood glue later-> still works.

Cosmetics: ** The soft vinyl sides DO NOT stand up to lugging around. I'm careful with my gear as possible under the circumstances, and that brown vinyl is simply cheap (started peeling away after first show). It's so bad it loses a star for this; though I do gig about 3 times a month; YMMV. I would buy the slip cover...but be grumpy about it (if doing this again).

I love the mini and can recommend it as a great practice amp or stage monitor for your guitar. It's good, not great as a solo amp for a small venue (Soloamp tower is probably better for that). Electronics are built like a brick house; vinyl is cheap.",2
9036,it worked as I figured it would. They want you to say more about the product than I want to say.,2
9037,"Great preamp with plenty of gain. The limiter is very useful and the 20 db boost does it's job. It's not the most transparent or flat preamp but it really does warm up the sound a bit when you are working with just an interview or a podcast. It works well with my dynamic and condenser microphones, and does not add any noticable ammounts of noise. The phantom power does its job and the jacks and case are quite sturdy.",2
9038,"This stand works as advertised. However, while the latch can be operated by the hand that is setting down the guitar, it is not quite as easy as I had hoped. If you really want something quick and easy, get a stand where the guitar leans more steeply and does not require latching. If you want something super-stable, I'm not sure this stand fits that bill, either (it's too light).",2
9039,"These are good value but other's have mentioned make sure you actually need this many because if you let them sit around too long they will degrade. I change out about once a week so this is ideal for me. The reason I've given it 4/5 stars is because the wound strings sometimes will not come out as the friction between them is too great, and I have had to use pliers to drag them out. Frustrating, but not a deal breaker.",2
9040,"I got this for my son. His previous gig bag was falling apart, so he knows how to abuse a bag! So far, he hasn't managed to more than scuff the bottom of this one. It has a huge rubber foot on the base, which looks like it should cushion the instrument from just about anything. The bass is automatically locked in place when it is in the case - no extra work needed to tie the neck in place. It's also easy to get the bass in and out. Just stand the case upright, unzip the top, and pull straight up. That's how I've been doing it with gig bags all along, but this one is actually MADE to be used that way! This case is obviously made to last, as well. Every aspect appears to have been well thought out. I highly recommend this case!",2

In short, great product I do not notice any difference between these cables and my other audio technica and monster patch cables. I would definitely recommend them.",2
9045,"This is great sounding pedal.  It has just about everything that a guitarist would want and it has a very tiny foot print.  I use this pedal when I take a stripped down rig to a gig.  It isn't as versatile as a Fractal, Line 6, or Digitech modeling gear but it's small and it does the job.  The patch memory cycle feature is okay but it really can't make up for the lack of dedicated patch up/down buttons .  The Bluetooth feature in my opinion is interesting but not all that useful.  The downloadable pedals that I've heard are uninspiring.",2

9048,"Oh my..... I had no idea a mouthpiece would make such a difference.  Bought my first tenor sax at the end of Feb.  I've been playing for less than 6 mos... but instructor said, ""you are not going to get the big sound you are looking for, until you invest in something like a Selmer C*""  Had bought my sax on Amazon and took it to a local place and had it checked out... all good, tried lots of mouthpieces, but only found the leather ligature made a difference for me.  Six months later--- I have been reminded that I tried the mouthpieces before I learned to play sax.  I agreed, but I wasn't prepared to spend over $150 for a mouthpiece, yet - so I tried this one.  I obviously can't compare to the C*, but I can say that it is an amazing improvement over the stock mouthpiece that comes with my tenor.  I have a fuller tone and my low notes are huge!  Thank you!  This will keep me playing until next year when I've proven I am a player, not just a learner.  Until then, I am VERY HAPPY with this mouthpiece.",2

9051,"I find this pedal to be an underappreciated model from boss. as the name says, this pedal is almost 99% metal tone. This pedal has separate dist & gain knobs(!) U can get a slightly creamy tone with dist knob fully down & only adding some gain. Turn up the dist & suddenly its a head crusher. When used with a tube amp, this thing delivers unbelievable crunchy power. I've tried playing it into the overdrive channel of tube amps & the pedal pushes the overdriven tubes with its own colors to deliver some metal riffs which will disembowel your audience. Another plus point is that tone & bottom controls are separate. which means u can turn up the tone to be fairly bright but also add deep bass with the bottom knob.
Depending on the setting, your riffs are gonna sound fat(in a good way) or obese(if u turn up the knob fully). This is also useful for having a screaming metal lead tone with high freqs while also having a fat body. U can get fairly decent sound with a solid state amp but remember that this pedal sounds all out modern metal. its never going to sound like classic rock or classic marshall.",2
9052,"I have been utilizing the Denon DL 110 for two years. I am not able to compare it with other brands of moving coil carts in it's class or price range (either low or high output) since this is my first leap or crossover from an MM(moving magnet) set up. I can certainly say what I DO like about this high output MC cartridge,though...

  It presents itself VERY favorably as a musically and sonically involving cartridge. There are other cartridges out there which cost more(defunct Shure V15VxMR comes to mind, which now commands outrageous ""new old stock"" prices on various bidding internet sites,but I digress) that are known to be ""dull"",""flat"", and, or, simply boring;The DL 110 is anything but. Period. Due to it's high output 1.6 mV signal and freq.range or response  of 20,000 Hz -45,000 Hz, yes, it does remind me of a pricier MM cart soundwise--- but that's where any sonic similarities or mimicking audio playback characteristics end. It is a bit more refined and resolved in the high frequencies range when compared to my other less costly MM carts AND even against my expensive Shure...Bass is also notably clean but NOT too tight, restricted,thin,sloppy,muddy nor exaggerated. The middle frequency range,however, while still admirably presentable with vocals,both male and female, it could be tipped a tad more in the ""upfront"" sense. Still, it is not recessed nor sounds as though the cartridge is performing in that ""V"" shaped in-line equalizer frequency formation(bass turned up full blast,mids way down low to the  ""V""'s point tipped bottom,and highs pushed up to ear piercing status)---Visually, that ""V"" shaped frequency setting on any EQ always reminds me of a flock of birds flying south for the winter,LOL.--- I would never want to give up the Denon DL 110 and chastise it regarding the mids department. Sure, there are other cartridges out there whose performance might outshine the Denon in reference to the mids or prove that that is one of their sonic or signature strengths. For what this Denon does so exceptionally well and in it's modest price range, the mids are not really an issue at all now that I think of it!

  As an inner groove tracker and sibilance handler , the DL 110 shows that it can put up a decent fight with it's elliptical shaped stylus (not a perfect victorious win, but a decent one). I must first say that I have used this Denon cartridge on a Technics 1600MK2 turntable, a JVC QL Y66F, and now it is mounted onto a Denon DP 59L---I really like the way it performs with the Denon( Denon on Denon). I don't know if it's that psychological play on the consumer mind(in me) that name brands should always stick with same name brand equipment or it really is a great synergistic matching/pairing. I don't doubt the latter since I really like the way it sounds on my Denon DP 59L than it did with the Technics or JVC---still, the Denon DL 110 did take a liking to the Technics medium mass arm. However,with all three 'tables,the DL 110 displayed a sort of etchy-like sound quality,but not shrill;It did take a number of hours(not sure if it's 10 or 20 or even 40 hours) before a well balanced tonal characteristic projected from this cart(""broken in"")...

Inner groove distortion (IGD) is that pesky audible trait caused by the  stylus trying to track tightly packed groove modulations and information contained in the last few tracks of a record side---Sometimes, that can also be a characterstic combo of a worn out record or stylus, or both,incorrect anti-skate setting,misalignment of the cart,etc. It is IGD that has kept many a record listener thinking or believing in the myth that IGD is completely unavoidable and must be tolerated;That is is a permament part of the vinyl medium. Less expensive or cheaply made cartridges with their styli cannot overcome this or exhibit poor tracking abilities towards the end of a record. Also, the shape of the stylus will determine this (spherical versus elliptical versus fine line contact).The ""annoyance"" is made obvious by a shrill or distorted sound in which music and vocals take on a screechy or harsh-etch-like quality. A finer shaped and cut stylus (usually with a smaller footprint)such as some ellipticals and a plethora of fine-line or line contact styli can defeat this with no problem---unless, you truly have a worn out record. I have caught the DL -110 on a few occasions trying to just barely give up this fight;It doesn't.

As for sibilance (the letter ""s"" in vocals or the ""th"" and harsh ""z"" sounds as well as cymbals sounding like brittle static), again, the Denon does require some broken in time to start to smooth this type of vinyl medium playback anomaly out...With the DL 110, there is NO sharp ""sssss's"" cutting across the room through your speakers once it retains it's not-so-brand-new-outta-the-box period.

How does the Denon DL 110 compare to my other cartridges???My other cartridges happen to be a Shure V15VxMR ,an Audio Technica AT 440ML, and a Grado Prestige Blue...

As a sidebar,Shure ceased it's production of their cart a few years ago due to ""exotic materials"" becoming unobtanium according to Shure's website( I will mourn my Shure when it wears out)...Against the Shure, the Denon is more inviting and musical. It has a nice ample supply of solid bass. Yet, the Shure is an absolute winner and gem of a tracker for both sibilance and inner groove distortion right out of the box through and through over the Denon DL 110!The Shure is one of the BEST groove trackers I have ever owned,thus so far, even though just a little bit somewhat lacking in the ""rich bass,bright highs, and musically inviting"" analog vinyl categories...The Shure also only requires anywhere from 1 g-1.25, pushing no more over 1.5 g for optimal stylus pressure tracking force;The DL 110 requires anywhere from 1.6-2.0g of tracking force for optimal performance. Cartridges that require lighter tracking forces for optimal play will save your precious record collection from quicker wear and tear. The Shure requires so little stylus pressure to be able to extract so much groove wall information versus the Denon. The Denon can hold it's own pretty well but not like the Shure. Again, the Denon ,at times, seems to want to give up the battle but always leans towards the winning side!

Now, the Denon DL 110 against the AT 440ML? The Denon has better soothing and more detailed highs to my ears(NOT soft or rolled off highs like the Shure). The finer subtlety allows me to hear things that otherwise just sound BRIGHT on the AT 440ML.The mids are more pronounced on the Denon. The AT 440 ML has that ""V"" shaped graphic equalizer frequency setting I mentioned earlier in this review.  However, the AT 440 ML has a wider soundstage field and greater channel separation. The Denon's is just admirable and firm with good central imaging. Nothing sounds smeared or confusing, though I do wish I could pinpoint certain instruments easier in the air with the Denon's soundstage dimensional field as I can with the Audio Technica. The AT 440 ML has more lush and deeper bass,not boxy(albeit,kinda colored along with the highs)...

I'll just say that out of all these cartridges, my least favorite to compare with the Denon is the Grado Blue. What I did like about the Blue against the Denon is it's punchy and very solid central sonic imaging (some mistake this for sounding too mono, but I think of it as the Grado filling a void where other carts fail to do and end up having a ""hollow"" exaggerated stereo sound).The bass on the Grado feels more solid, also... However, the Grado (no matter what turntable or cart I used it on) could NOT handle sibilance or inner groove distortion like the Denon! Plus, on a Technics turntable, the Grado is an unshielded cart that will sonically hum as it nears towards a direct drive magnet motor. So, the Grado Blue and this wonderful Denon ""Red"" are worlds apart...

 To look at the big picture,overall, one cannot go wrong in purchasing  the Denon High Moving Coil DL 110 cartridge. I have yet to personally hear from another Denon DL 110 owner to dislike or have any type of disdain for this red pearlescent beauty...Almost forgot to mention, aesthetically, the Denon looks like a cart that should sell for a lot more loot; It just looks expensive and very solid,big and blocky in that audiophile sorta way :)",2

9057,these work out grate thank you,2
9058,"I'm reviewing product only, since I got mine elsewhere. I'm a former performing Guitarist with a lot of Big Buck instruments in my stable. First off, let me say that these are BARE BONES instruments. Not much candy or polish. That said, I tried a lot of ukuleles at twice the price or more, and find these superior to a uke in virtually every way. Especially if you already know some guitar, you can blow off the learning curve. Quality of sound? Good, NOT awesome. But as good as most tenor ukes of twice the price. Sustain, volume and tone were surprisingly good. Playability on mine was good enough ROTB that I won't change anything, at least not yet. Later, my dilettante, high-end guitar self may catch up to me. But for now, it's exactly what I wanted: a decent uke/travel guitar without the limitations of four strings. Newbies not wishing to learn the extra strings might consider a uke instead, OR you could just play the bottom four strings and save two for later! Quality of build? Meh...not bad. I ordered two. The worse one came with a black scuff at the top of the headstock, a little glue slop inside and a little rough wood around the edge of the top. All of which I consider acceptable on a piece of this price. If you pay two or three times as much, you will still get basically the same quality, based on what I've seen. You might get more bells and whistles, but not much more sound. You can't hear abalone or inlays. The main limitation on sound is size. If you don't go bigger, PRICIER won't change anything much. Trust me I tried 'em all. If you're really serious, lay out some serious coin. If you're just looking for a go-to car/campfire guitar. This'll do the job! I gave it four stars instead of five for the Quality Control, which could be better, and because...lets face it: EVERYTHING couild be better.",2

9064,"I've used RODE mics for years and love their products. So, it was a no-brainer purchase for me. And, as always, they did not let me down. The stand has a great look because all of the springs are internal, which is a nice little extra. I'm using it for a USB mic, so I liked the fact that it didn't come with an XLR cable already run through the device. But, it does come with cable ties to help you manage it.

So far, I have only used the clamp desk mount and it works great. The one that can be mounted in a hole in the desk looks great and is designed well. I will likely moved over to it once I figure out exactly where I want the stand to be positioned. Simple instructions, but simple is all you need.

I used this with a Blue Yeti and it holds it extremely well. I have no problems at all. The stand has smooth action when moving the mic around as well. It is a typical RODE product, made well, does exactly what it is supposed to and looks good doing it.",2

9072,"I previously used plain naphtha and a ton of elbow grease to clean my guitars.  It was working okay and the nice thing about naphtha is you can get it at any hardware store and its well known to be safe for most guitar applications.  The problem is it is a pain in the butt to use because it is volatile and evaporates in the blink of an eye.  It will also turn any adhesive to jelly (i.e. pickguard adhesive).

So my guitars were covered in haze and fingerprints and I wanted to clean them up but couldn't muster the energy to do it the old way.  So I finally broke down and decided to get some dedicated product.  After a bit of research I read a lot of positive reviews of the Music Nomad stuff so I decided to give it a go.  I have now used each of the three products included in the kit so I will try to offer some thoughts on each:

- The Polish:  pretty simple to use - apply with a cloth, let it dry, and then buff it off.  It smelled good, worked as advertised and didn't destroy my guitars' finishes.  It would be great if it could make me a cup of coffee and give me a back rub too, but it's polish.  You can't really ask much more.  One other thing to note is the polish and cleaner smell great, but the smell wears off quickly and won't overpower the beautiful smell of nitrocellulose and tonewood that emanates from your favorite acoustic.

- The One Cleaner:  I was pretty impressed with this product.  Has the same mist on / wipe off simplicity of your average cleaner but it goes just a bit further into the territory of polish/wax.  I used the polish to clean up the haze where my arm touches the lower bout, but I really took care of the rest of it with ""the One"".  It has a nice gentle solvent that will break down any dirt, oil, or sticky junk but also leaves the finish looking shiny and renewed.  Again, same great smell as the polish.

- F-one Fretboard Oil:  I was also impressed by this product, but I want to clear the air first.  There is a lot of information out there about oiling fretboards (accurate or not), but my personal opinion is that in most cases it is entirely unnecessary.  Just playing your guitar will transfer oil from your fingers to the wood, and over-applying oil will just cause more junk to accumulate.  In the event that someone uses fretboard oil, it is also my opinion that it should be used extremely sparingly (i.e. 2 or 3 drops on a cloth will do the whole board).  With that said, the first time I used this product is the first time I have used fretboard oil - ever.  I only applied it to one of my acoustics where the bare rosewood looked particularly dry and porous.  One of the main reasons I selected this product was because their description of the oil alleviates a lot of my concerns:  they only use natural oils, no detergents, no lemon oil, no other crap.  With just a precious few drops it took my board from dry and porous to smooth and dark with a hint of shine.  Admittedly, I won't get much use out of this product but I am very satisfied with the result.

- Included Microfiber Towels:  The towels are a nice inclusion to this kit and help justify the price tag (you could buy each of the cleaning products individually, less the towels, and save a few bucks).  I actually tried to see if I could buy the 3 products and source some other towels for a smaller total price and decided it wasn't worth it.  One cool thing is the towels are different from each other.  One has a tight weave and is meant for applying the oil and scrubbing the fretboard.  The other is a softer terry weave and is meant for handling the top/body of the guitar.  My only complaint is they go out of their way to say that the towels are lint-free and the unfortunate truth is I had some tiny fibers lodged in the wax of the cleaner after the first application.  I washed the towel and tried again, and everything was fine.

Overall these products are high quality and I was satisfied with the results they gave me.  Remember to wash the blue towel to get rid of any manufacturing lint or you may have redo your first application.  I would recommend this kit to anyone with guitars or other similar musical instruments.",2
9073,Easy to use.,2
9074,"I've been playing bass for about 17 years. These are unquestionably the finest bass strings I've played, for my tastes.

If you're never played flatwound bass strings before (they aren't very common today), and are unsure about spending so much money on these, you could try starting with a set of D'Addario Chromes to get the general idea - fuller, more consistent tone than roundwound strings, less finger noise, great for recording. (Maybe not superb for slapping.) But the Thomastiks sound better than the Chromes, and feel better on the fingers than the Chromes.

I may use some other strings on occasion for specific purposes, but I expect the Thomastik flatwound strings to be my primary bass strings for as long as I can get them.

Also available in 5-string and 6-string sets.",2
9075,I bought this for a breedlove which didn't come with a hard case. The breedlove fits snugly and has plenty of padding. It smells like any other case don't be deceived by other reviews it's plastic and glue. For 54 bucks it's a steal.,2

It creates different echo and resonance effects depending on how you are playing the strings...from brilliant chorus to scifi space echo effects...  This is not a controllable delay like the DD7...but more of a flavored echo smart pedal that self-adapts and changes with your playing style...so you can leave all the settings the same and change the effect by changing the speed, impact, or type of pick on the strings...  I'm pleased with the sounds I'm getting out of it...",2
9079,Gorgeous and sweet,2
9080,"These are fantastic acoustic panels. I used 3 sets of 12 panels (two in Red/Grey and one in Burgendy/Gray) to treat quite a large bedroom converted to a studio / workspace. What I love about the colors offered is the ability to design an aesthetically pleasing pattern for the walls.

On top of looking great, they perform extremely well for absorbing sound. Mid/high frequencies are virtually eliminated when strategically placed in the environment. Although: bass is still an issue you will need to address with a trapping solution

Because I own the property where my studio is located, I was comfortable mounting these squares directly onto the walls using Auralex Foam Tak. DO NOT go for any of the generic hardware store spray adhesives, as they simply will NOT work. Mine fell down after a day and it was a pain to remove the sticky residue off the walls. The Autalex Foam Tak is the only thing I would recommend and now they appear to be staying up nicely with no signs of coming off any time soon.

If you, however, rent or don't want to damage your walls, try mounting these squares onto ply or foam core then either nailing or hanging from your walls. Command strips would work too but ONLY if you mount the squares to a more solid surface like ply or foam core first, as tape, adhesives and command strips will not stick directly to this foam.

Overall these do a wonderful job of being both aesthetically pleasing and effective in acoustically treating your environment. You won't need to plaster your entire wall space with these if you are strategic about placement and I am more than happy with the results of my installation using these panels!",2
9081,"This is an extremely good volume pedal.  I have not had a lot of experience with volume pedals, but I will try to break down each set of criteria in order to convey the quality of the product.

CONSTRUCTION:  Very well built, very solid pedal.  It is huge though, bigger than my full tone wah pedal in every dimension.  The part that moves the pot inside is also a metal blade, unlike other pedals that use either a rubber band or string to apply tension to the interior pot.

TONE:  There is very minimal tone loss.  With the volume pedal, my signal is going through the volume pedal and a couple true bypass pedals (compressor, wah, and OD)  When I hooked my guitar up directly to the amp, there was very minimal high end reduction.  It basically sounds like you added a tone knob and turned it down to 8-9 instead of 10.  Now, this could be the pedal, or it could also be the lengths of cable going into the pedal and then into the amp being shortened by half when I disconnect the pedals.  That's being said however.... It was not enough loss to have me change any of my settings besides maybe my tone knob on the guitar I cranked up a tiny bit.  In other words... if you are a tone hound and small things will drive you nuts, maybe a volume pedal isn't for you (inherent in the design of a volume pedal there will almost always be tone loss as a volume pedal IS a potentiometer which has resistance, no matter what you do).

FEEL/USAGE
Others have commented that there is a cliff, this is true.  BUT something to keep in mind about potentiometers again.... they usually work as AUDIO tapers, what this means, is that it tapers your signal on a LOGARITHMIC scale, not a linear scale.  Using a logarithmic scale, a volume pot at roughly volume 5 won't be giving you 50% volume, but instead will give you 10% (logarithmic scaling is NOT 1:1).  So again, inherent in the design of something that has an audio taper, is that is operates on a logarithmic scale, which means, that as you keep decreasing the volume, the effect becomes more drastic as you roll more off..... I.E  once the volume starts dropping... it REALLY starts dropping.

THE TAKE AWAY
even with some minor problems, this pedal is very handy.  I play a lot of musicals and frequently I am being used as a percussionist, which in todays world means using a great deal of electronics.  A volume pedals lets me adjust my electronic signal without having to drop to the floor to hit the mixer knob when a sound is too loud or too quiet.  This pedal is also handy on the guitar, and even if you never wanted volume, it can be used as an expression pedal for another effect of some type.  Overall, this is a very versatile piece of equipment and can be JUST the thing you need if you find yourself having to adjust volumes of electronic equipment on the fly and need an easy way to swell, diminish, or just adjust the output level.",2
9082,"Let me just start by saying...WOW! This little speaker blew my mind. I've been involved with sound systems now for nearly 10 years so I've dealt with a lot of cheap equipment and some top of the line equipment. I'd place this in the top 10 best speakers I've ever used. Out of box it is small but this thing puts out some sound. I used the usb to test the play back ability and it works fanstastic, just plug and play. The volume at about half was literally loud enough for a school size gym. Bluetooth hooked up to my phone easily, but I didn't have any music to play. I also tested the line in with a microphone and that works great. The sound is super loud abd super clear. I'm already planning on buying another one to use. You won't go wrong If your looking for a compact portable all in one PA.",2

Beyond the Old Standby having a little more twang, I have found that it's much easier to bend and that one can achieve a little more volume variance than with the Hot Metal. They are both great instruments for the price, but I have to give my full endorsement to Old Standby if I had to choose between the two.",2
9087,"I wish this amp would have been around twenty years ago. I play a gig at a local bistro and my Fender Acoustisonic Jr. just developed a constant, loud static sound. Since this is a steady gig, I needed an amp to keep me going.  I checked the different brands of amps and then called the Fishman Company and talked to Frank and asked him what amp would work the best for me. He told me the Fishman LBX-Performer would work fine. I ordered the amp and play a large jazz box (L5 type) through the amp as well as have a CD player going which plays background music. The tone is really nice, and the effects work well. The weight is 29 lbs. which is no problem for a 70 year old like me. I suggest buying the cover which I did to help protect the amp's finish since some of the reviews said the covering was pretty fragile. All in all a great little amp for a restaurant gig or small venue of 75-100 people. Pricey, but worth the money.",2
9088,"Most of the reviews on here discuss what size mic can be used with this shockmount. I use this with an Electro-Voice RE20. It fits, just barely and the shock cord holds that 3-4lb beast very well. The tension screw adjustment on the base leaves a lot to be desired though. For the price, I don't know how you could go wrong.

I highly recommend this item. I don't see how the more expensive models could be 3-4 times better. Shock mounts are designed to isolate the microphone from vibration. Pretty basic idea and this gets the job done.",2

9091,"I recently revived a ""Hondo II"" Appalacian dulcimer that I gave my sister back in 1977, which she used for about ten years, then laid aside with two broken strings.  After glueing some things back together and polishing the thing up, I went string hunting.  The first set I found had ball ends, and even with the little brass balls punched out, the loops weren't big enough to go around the screw heads that the dulcimer used as pegs.

I was ready to rebuild that end of the dulcimer if I couldn't find strings that would work.  Thankfully, the D'Addario Dulcimer J6401 strings worked great.  The loops fit over the ""pegs,"" and the tone is very nice.  Thanks, D'Addario, for a nice product that met my needs.  Now the thing actually looks and sounds decent.  - Paul Race, SchoolOfTheRock",2

9095,"Fantastic tool. Ignore the review where the whiner is saying it is crap. If you have ever used a torque wrench or put on valve covers then this thing is a breeze. If not, here is how i did it... The pamphlet gives you tension numbers for different drums. I backed off all the keys till loose then finger tightened them in a star pattern. This gets you closer to even tension at all nuts. Then i picked the nut next to the label and snuck up on it. In other words, if you are shooting for 75 pounds, i went 70. I did that in the star pattern and you will notice when you do the one straight across, if you put it back on the previous one it went above 70. Thats why you sneek up on the numbers and go around it a couple times. Its importatnt that if you go above the number you are shooting for and have to back off to release tension that you back it off slightly further than needed then tension it back up to where you need it. I also found it helpful as I was tightening to tap the drum to stress relieve the drum head and get a more accurate reading. I am learning to play and am a former machinist so Have experience with dial indicators. When I got my used Sound Percussion set it sounded like crap. My brother in law bought this for me for Christmas and after using it, the set sounds fantastic!",2

9100,"I'm still trying to convince myself that I really got this work of art delivered UPS second day air for $465.
I literally saw the price change on this guitar right after I hit BUY NOW.
You will notice that the only ones available now are from 3rd parties.  I invite you to check those prices, as well as the big three guitar stores.
Not only is this instrument beautiful, the fit and finish rivals any I've seen.  A couple of months ago I bought that yellow flame maple Slash-AFD Les Paul from Amazon just to see if I like it.  I did, so much so that I sold it to the guy across the street after 3 months for what I paid for it and added $200 to it and got this translucent blue beauty.
The cream binding at top and fretboard add a touch of smooth class.  Those fake mother of pearl inlays shine and glisten like they're lit from within.
It weighs a ton and I'm still taking it to my guy for a trigger job but I could probably live with it as is.
I just know that for about $30, he can have those strings laying on top of the frets so it plays itself.
An earlier review mentioned how much better it looks in person and that is true to the nth degree.  And it would look good with the pick guard off.
Two little chrome screws secure it and can be replaced in their holes and I bet nobody'd ever notice.
I've got a lot to learn about this coil tapping stuff and having two sets of everything to figure out, but it comes with an instruction book as well as truss wrench.  The sound is killer coming out of a Champion 20 and with those click knobs, I'm still learning all its voices.
I bet you can't get one for under $600 new anywhere now, so I feel like I made an investment at the same time.
It doesn't come with a strap or a rinky-dink gig bag or anything, so don't ask.
DO however, call that Amazon Harmony number on any guitar you buy and they'll give you a 10% discount right then.
They are called Concierge Techs and those guys are great.  Kudos to Amazon for that.
It ships in its original box inside an Amazon outer box that's pretty well protected.  No complaints here.
Good luck finding one Boys, I don't hold out much hope for you.",2
9101,"I scored this one as a used item at a big box store, so the price was even cheaper than the very reasonable $350 new street price.  China has really upped their game with regards to quality guitar construction.  These and the Jagmaster and vintage modified line are great guitars.  At this price point, Squier had to make some compromises, but they wisely decided to spend a bit more where it counts-  The pickups, tuners, and neck.  These pickups do not require upgrade- they sparkle, jangle and roar.  All of the stratty sounds you expect can be had with these pickups.  To put it in perspective, I have a very nice MIM Standard Telecaster and I am looking to switch out the stock ceramic pickups with some Classic Vibe tele AlNiCos (If I don't bite the bullet on some OVs!).  The tuners are kluson styled and do a decent enough job.  I would have liked a higher ratio but you can tune just fine with a little patience.  The nut is plastic but was cut perfectly and does not bind.  The neck is a really comfortable profile- c shaped and ever so slightly thinner than a Strat Standard.  NOT the kind of thin you would find on say and Ibanez RG.  The aged poly looks and plays great.  Fretwork was nicely done as was the rosewood board.  The body is 2 piece Alder- which is less pieces than my made in Mexico Strat- and the finish is really lovely.  I have zero complaints about this guitar.  It feels solid.  The trem works fine with just occasional use, but I may block it like I tend to do with all my trems. It is the 'weak link' on this otherwise fine guitar.  I would do the same with an American Standard.  You can't dive bomb on any non locking trem and stay in tune.  I don't really use them much these days now that I have traded my spandex pants for Dockers lol.  Cork sniffers love to hate on Squier but another reviewer summed it up perfectly:  Unless you are signing autographs for a living, the Squier is at least as much guitar as you are a player.  I would gig this guitar in an instant.

There was a time when people looked down their noses at guitars made in the far east.  Japanese guitars were thought to be what you got when you couldn't afford a real guitar.  As it turns out,  Stevie Ray Vaughn was known to play a Japanese Tokai Springy Sound occasionally.  I would say his tone was pretty satisfactory.  Well China is the new Japan since it has high skilled, low waged labor.  And now that computers cut all the wood with perfection, it's cheaper and easier to get a great guitar for next to nothing.  Tone is really in your fingers !",2
9102,"I almost sent this back. I have a set of 4 plays and it would only control one light. I looked everywhere for the answer could find none. Then I thought if it controls one why not the rest, what if I set the dip switches to match the one that does work. So I did, I put the switches down except for the last one is up (on the lights) and it worked. So instead of having to learn about MDX controls the box does it for me. I am a real novice at this and it surely helped. Needless to say I am keeping it.",2

9105,"I didn't have to do much to the general shape of the Bridge. Naturally I had to shape / sand the feet to fit the violin. But I did sand a lot on the front of the Bridge. The front has no writing on it. I used a fine sand paper and I also sanded the front until there was a slight angle from the bottom to the top. The top being thinner than the bottom. I stopped when the top edge was about 3/16"" thick. It was a fair bit so sanding. But it looks and works very well. It was my first time replacing a Violin Bridge. But I think I did good and I think this Bridge is a very nice Bridge to use when you need one. I ordered another. Just in case, for the parts box.",2

The hardware is not the quality of more expensive cases but they work fine as well.  The case is sturdy and looks good.  The fit of the guitar is OK. the case is a little larger than the guitar and does not hug the guitar snugly and the neck rest seems a bit high causing slight pressure on the neck when in a horizontal position. Having said all  that I think it is worth a look.",2

DMX foggers are very pricey, and i'm not even sure if it is a DMX connector. also my unit is solid black with white letters not silver and black as shown. also like most DJ products, you are expected to know everything about the product. if you don't know everything about your product your SOL because there is no instructions. also i would like to thank the seller for not responding to my emails for info concerning the fogger connection, a simple ""i don't know"" would have been better than no response at all. i give the product a 5 star because this is for rating the product not the seller. the product is well built and very sturdy. it responds well to the music and the relay pack is not as noisy as i was expecting. the power cable on the relay pack could be longer.",2

9112,"I use a combination of many brands nowadays and the main thing I like about the V12's is that although it might be a little harder to find that ""good"" reed or two in the box compared to other brands nowadays that have 2-4 good reeds per box, the reeds last way longer than other brands, more than making up for the difference. These reeds are very robust, you can break them in a bit more aggressively and not worry about them dying as much. I play about 3 times per week on average (2+ hours) and have had some of these in my vandoren case that are literally 3 years old and as long as you keep cycling your reeds properly, they will last.

Are they overpriced? The Amazon price is actually extremely good and I think still makes them a good value. I've tried some newer reeds, some that outperform these for band music where a little more brightness is tolerable and enjoyable but I still think the V12 is a great cut for an all-rounder reed that can tackle many different styles of music in one sitting.

My only complaint is that they don't come in quarter sizes like most newer reeds do. Easily fixed by sanding down the bottom on the Vandoren glass resurfacing kit.",2
9113,I replaced the stock ESP LTD pickups in my LTD 251HM with Blackouts and they have turned a practice guitar into a scream machine.  They have great dynamics and good balance with added lower mids which make my 5150 seem a great deal thicker.  I would give them 5 stars but the electronics are completely disassembled.  EMGs have some of the wiring done when you get them so they will take longer to install.  The posts on the pots were wider than stock so I had to drill out the holes to make them fit.  These can supposedly be swapped out with EMGs which I'm considering because they are superior to your standard EMG 81 85 set in tone.  We'll see how the newer SD metal and EMG X series pups compare.  It looks like there are a ton of new choices for actives and the quality of these pups I think re-energized the industry.,2

took me about 30 minutes to get set up and tuned with minor tweaking to get it just right for me. it sounds just fine for
sitting around playing a few beatles tunes, or led zep tunes etc. just adds a nice change of pace when playing guitars with
friends. I have no intention of dedicating much more effort in the instrument than to be capable of playing songs that i like
that have mandolin in them. for that purpose, this does the job. Its constructed well, the tuners are perfectly fine and hold
their position and tuning well. and it is an all wood mandolin which means it will mature in sound as well, to the best of its
potential, the more you play it and with age. Great bargain for the price to have some fun with, and a change from just playing
guitar all the time. OH and wow will it build the calluses on your fingers, much more wear and tear on your fingers than a guitar.",2

9129,"I know everyone has personal preferences, so ""best strings"" is purely my opinion.  But, c'mon man, Jaco, Chris Squire, Geddy Lee, Stanley Clarke, etc. ad nauseum.  There is a reason why so many of the greatest electric bass players of all time choose these strings.  The harmonics are clear and bright, the bass is round and booming, and they have an easy to play feel.  I have played bass for 39 years now and for 34 of those years I have been a paid professional.  If you are buying a brand of strings because they last longer then you have missed the point.  The point is always to sound your best and these strings are one of the best ways I have found to insure that you always do.  I am not sure how you have the tone knobs set on your bass and amp if you can't get a bright tone from these strings.  Have you ever listened to Jaco?  He was playing these on a jazz bass through an 18 inch speaker and it is as clear and bright as any bass sound ever.  I have no problem reproducing that clarity and tone with my instruments either.",2
9130,"Love JP! Got these recommended to me by a guy who has at least 4 or 5 instruments worth 30 plus grand and god knows how many other super nice ones. They are wonderful strings. Sound great and last a super long time. Don't have the nice bass of bluegrass strings or the cut of elixirs, but they are extremely well balanced all around. And most of all, these will last 2 or 3 times as long as others. They deteriorate so slow you don't really realize it's happening until you've gone waaaay to long without changing them. These are the best bang for your buck.",2
9131,nice,2
9132,"I have used D'Addario EJ16 for about 10 years now and have occasionally tried other popular brands and newer formulas (coating, etc.). I may be just stuck in old school because I've been playing about 25 years, but I like these precisely made traditional steel strings for acoustic steel sounds better than any others I've tried.

EJ16's get in tune and stay in tune quickly within minutes of being newly strung.  The tone remains crisp for several days after being strung and then transitions to a less crisp, but still distinct warm sound. I'm festidious about tuning so I also love EJ16's because they usually only need a touch up even using a Peterson tuner.  The gauge sizes on this set are also big enough to really activate the soundboard of a nice (or any) acoustic, but they're still light enough to be pleasant to play and can be bent for vibrato. I'm guilty of not changing strings as often as I probably should, but they will stay in this middle state of a nice sound for at least another 2 to 3 weeks. Giving them a vigourous cleaning will eek a little more life out of them.  They'll eventually get dull sounding and not tune up as precisely after plenty of use/time (usually about a month for me playing at church and other places multiple times per week).

I use D'Addario for classical acoustic, rock/pop electric, 12 string acoustic and jazz electric.  I've tried many other brands but I beleive they simply know more and have invested more than anyone else in making strings for all sort of instruments.  They have some newer formulations such as web coatings, but I think the pure, natural sound and crisp tuning of the EJ16 is better (and more cost effective) for the music I play.",2

9135,"What a beautiful harp this is, feels very substantial in the hands, has a certain heft to it, defiantly heavier than my Manji.
I will not compare the two.
But I will say that the Suzuki Hammond Harp is a fine Instrument, it has a Beautiful sound, and a very fine luxurious tone, I hope to be enjoying this for some time to come.
The Black Covers are Nice Looking and slick on the Mouth/Lips The Black Comb also Nice and it is slick as well.
Reeds and Comb and covers are held together by 9 screws.
This is a air tight harp that plays really well, the back is open and the harp has a clean clear bright tone, that is loud when  Loud is needed.

I will be picking up a couple, few more of these. They are worth the money.
One thing that I look for in a new harp is, How hard do I have to work for this new harp sound good, Also does it make me sound better than I am, or do i have to really work it, for the result wanted.

I will note that the Reed plates stick out from the covers and comb, but! This harp is Very comfortable!! to play, no sharp edges anywhere,
The Reed plates stick out the same on the Manji, and Fire Breath as well.",2

9139,"The JM4 Looper is way more than just a looping pedal. It's really a ""band in a box"" type of product.  There are 200+ different custom guitar tones and over 100 backing tracks of various styles: rock, metal, blues, country, funk, pop, you name it.  As with usual Line 6 gear, it's got built-in amp modeling for typical Fender / VOX and Boutique amp tones.  As well as built-in reverb, flanger, echo, phaser, chorus etc.  Its darned easy to just start jamming to the backing tracks.  You can change the guitar tone, the amps etc.  Even better, you can change the tempo and key.  (however, if you change more than 2 half-steps some tracks distort weirdly.)

If you use the Line 6 JM4 Looper, you will no doubt get better in your playing.  But if you're looking for ""just"" a looper, consider something else as you might get frustrated with all the features.

9160,"The video on the top of this page (at the time of this review) and the product description say it all. This is a full-featured personal monitor that can also double as a main for tiny venues. I am going to try to avoid parroting other reviewers and the product information and provide a few thoughts and caveats.

This is superb as a small main for instruments like guitars that tend towards high and mid range frequencies, but are limited in lower frequencies. For instruments like a bass (mic'd acoustic or electric) this falls short as a coffee-house main, but is perfect as a monitor. It does, however, work beautifully for vocals.

You can daisy chain these together, as well as run the output into a larger powered speaker and get the low end that works perfectly with keyboards and other instruments with a lot of bass in its frequency range.

One application where this is especially invaluable as a monitor is in venues with high ceilings. Too often those rooms seem to steal the sound and it's as though you are playing silently. These rectify that problem nicely.

As a speaker's PA this will literally fill a large room. The 150 Watts is very real and the speaker, although small, projects human voices in a crystal clear manner. Even if you turn up the gain there is practically no distortion of breakup for speaking or singing vocals. I suspect that Mackie purposefully optimized this for vocals.

I love the mic stand mount on the botton, but know that the speaker is tilted about 10 to 12 degrees upward on a stand, so make sure you mount it on a low stand for close in use as a personal monitor. The adapter for for top is another handy feature because you can unscrew your boom from the mic stand and insert this monitor in the middle. If you are a vocalist I am betting you will love this feature.

One final note: this is rock solid from a reliability perspective. I have never experienced an outage or failure in over a year of heavy use. Contrast that with the spotty reliability of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Behringer-EUROLIVE-B205D-Active-150-Watt-PA-Monitor-Speaker-System/dp/B00378GEAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Behringer EUROLIVE B205D Active 150-Watt PA/Monitor Speaker System</a>&nbsp;that is a direct competitor and the premium price for this Mackie is warranted in my opinion.

Has no trouble whatever picking up the low e-string on my Seagull acoustic, which flummoxes my Intelli 600. Having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier. The only down side, and this is a matter of taste, is the garish color. You shouldn't leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark, so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away, which may be just as well.",2

One thing I did notice though, is at the tail end (whip), the numbers that are printed on the cable wore off after the second, or third time.  Not a big deal, as I just used my label maker to re-label them.  That is the reason for the 4 star rating.  It is worth the money.

But I've always struggled with recording since I couldn't play finger style bass, and the pick sound was horrible. Enter the Wedgie rubber picks. These suckers really do sound like fingers! At least in the context of a whole mix. I'm getting more very soon.",2

9176,"when i got the original kaossilator a couple of years ago, i instantly fell in love with it, to the point of wishing that korg would somehow come up with a professional version similar to that of the wonderful kaoss pad 3. and voila! korg, being the friendliest-brand for bedroom musicians granted that wish with the kaossilator pro.

this latest kaoss sound producer is a must not only for dj's but also musicians into sound art and soundscape design. korg hit the perfect nail with all the new added features expanding the original to a higher music creation level.

this is probably one of the best gears to come out of korg's camp in 2010. truly, as one said online, 'gadget music is the new punk rock!' keep 'em coming korg!",2

9194,"I had to write this review because of my recent significant experience with Dunlop Jazz III picks, not to be confused with Jazz III ""XL"" picks, which are larger. I started playing 3 and 1/2 years ago and only took 5 or 6 lessons, mainly to ensure I had the basic form right. I used different picks, primarily Gibson and Fender Mediums, primarily because the guy at the guitar store recommended them, and did not really know what I needed.

As time went on, I tried the Dunlop Jazz III XLs and stuck with them for three years. It worked great for Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Metal. Also, the wide base worked well with aggressive strumming, and the stiffness allowed for aggressive single-note lines. You could really move those strings around with authority and accuracy. Yet I soon realized that I was in a rut, and could not increase my speed during my practice of scales and fast riffs.

A couple of years ago, a guy had recommended the smaller, original Jazz IIIs, but I tried them and did not like them. Around three months ago, I picked one up from the original package that had been sitting around, and I soon found my speed increasing. This was especially true during string-skipping maneuvers. I believe the wideness of the Jazz III XLs made them a little ungainly for me at higher speeds when maneuvering between strings and having to take awkward picking angles. The smaller size of the Jazz IIIs helped minimize these impediments. I use both the original nylon AND the Stiffo versions, although I favor the Stiffo because I don't want my picks deforming too much at speed. The Jazz III XLs do have the advantage when strumming rhythm passages. The wider base gives you more to hold on to and more leverage with the up and down strokes. But, as my fingers adjust and grow stronger, I am finding I can strum almost as well with the smaller Jazz IIIs.

Finally, I like the slightly duller yet solid sound of the Dunlop Jazz IIIs (compared to the medium picks I was using, which were almost ""scratchy"" and thin sounding), although I have discovered that when playing with distortion, it may be necessary to increase my attack to get that breakup and edge that I am looking for. Since I switched, I have to say the difference in my technical ability, and my tone, has been dramatic!",2

9201,Really great inexpensive delay pedal. Sounds really good and durable. JOYO makes some really great pedals. Also have the power supply as well.,2
9202,"This pedal is interesting... I bought it instead of buying several amplifiers (that is the point)... The Tweed Setting has a warm boost; the British setting has balls like a Marshall, and the California has a higher boost with a crunch.  I took off a star for the breathing noises emitted from the pedal when engaged.  When I use my noise gate, the breathing goes away.  I'd imagine that this pedal would have to have some noise to emulate the Tube tones.  I don't actually own any tube amplifiers--just solid state.  However, I can complain much because the pedal was under $30.00 and it does provide some boost and additional tonal possibilities... Best, EJ",2

9204,"Let me start out by saying that this product (ableton intro) is almost identical to the ableton cd you get when you buy certain controllers (novation launch pad) except this version comes with several gigabites of extra sounds n stuff. So anyway, I was working with the fruityloops demo for a while and I wanted to start getting serious about making music on my computer. It turns out that 99% of the electronic music i listened to was made with ableton and everyone was always saying ableton was better than fruity loops. Well now that I have ableton live intro I can say that ableton is extremely better than fruityloops! This intro version is great! you can do alot of things, you can make rap beats, techno songs, you can use it to DJ, you can make your own band to play along with you on guitar, bass, drums, whatever!

THE THING I DIDNT LIKE was the limitation of instruments you can have at once, although it somes with 100s of intruments you can only use 8 at once, to put that into prospective, 8 instruments is like a very simple techno song.

So ya overall this product is great... but the limitations really make you want to buy the full version of ableton live.",2

9214,Nice sound.,2
9215,"I bought both this WCP-60G and the WCP-60V. The 60G clips on easier and has much stronger output. However, after trying many different placement options, I ended up instead choosing the 60V to use with two different types of acoustic guitar.

For either pickup, you really need to use a compressor (I use the Mooer Yellow Comp) or cab-emulation pedal to get better sound and bring it to life. Multiband EQ is also a good additional option.

Positioned to try to sound best, the 60G was louder, fuller and had more bass. The best sounds from the 60G, IMO, were when the pickup was pulled back a bit to only touch wood and so that little if any contact overlapped the pickguard. However, even the best 60G positioning did not really sound very natural or balanced. The 60V was better for that.

While guitar picking worked for both pickups, strumming tended to sound unnatural and distorted. I could not find any position where strumming sounded good.

BTW, I found that the most natural sound from the WCP-60V was obtained by placing the pickup near the far back of the bottom of the soundhole and then hooking the curved clip firmly over the inner soundhole brace so that the pickup was very flat and locked in place as much as possible. The pickup was angled backward at about 60 degrees from the bottom string.

UPDATE (one added star):

Contrary to the photo on the package, I confirm that the most natural sound is by putting this WCP-60G pickup on the inside of the soundhole with clip on the outside.

For me, the [revised] best sound was placing the clip of the 60G at the top middle of the soundhole and angling it about 25 degrees forward. It even sounds okay when strumming. Cable went inside under the strings and out again from the bottom of the soundhole.

After more listening tests, I now prefer the WCP-60G (inside soundhole, no compressor) for my Seagull S6+ Spruce but prefer the sound of the WCP-60V (outside soundhole) for my Seagull Excursion Natural Folk SG.",2
9216,"I used to own the original Holy Grail Reverb pedal back around 2002, and it was simply amazing. So when it came time to get another reverb pedal recently, the Cathedral was a no brainer. It's got that amazing sound that's just miles above any other reverb pedal out there. The only minor nag I have is in regards to the actual finish on the unit. Whomever EHX put in charge of painting the cases should be fired. The first one I received had MAJOR unpainted spots on the side, and Amazon was cool enough to let me exchange it. The second one I received had what were clearly paint bubbles that had popped at some point, and left behind defects in the paint finish. I realize we're not talking about a $1000 guitar here, but $220 is a nice chunk of change for a pedal, and I think the attention to quality and detail should really be evident at that price point.",2

9225,"I'm far from a new guitarist, but have only begun adding guitar effects pedals to my lineup in the last year, largely due to the insistence of my bandmates.  On my board constantly at the ready now is this jewel.  For reference, I don't play through some major head and big ole honkin' half stack.  I play through simple classics - a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or Marshall AVT50 (both modestly priced, great amps for different reasons, but IMHO, pretty hard to beat the Fender...).  The Carbon Copy pedal to me sounds terrific in slapback setting (being sure amp is pegged at 0 reverb).  The guys were right.  Certain pedals are a must for quality of tone and style in performance.  The quality of my amps was plenty for me, but I was missing out.  For the right songs and compositions, this pedal makes it darned hard to put my guitar down.  I'm still more of a purist, setting the amp to modest presence and reverb, but seriously, the Carbon Copy is that nice.  Anybody who tries it is hooked in a few measures.  A few simple licks turns into a few songs, and pretty soon you wonder how you got by without that sound.

Simple, clean, warm, no hiss, no buzz.  Other pedals worthy and affordable - EH Little Big Muff, Boss Super Chorus, Korg tuner, and your choice for a preamp booster for solos (my vote - blow off the snobs and get an affordable Behringer preamp booster pedal) and a compressor pedal to keep it all even.  That's plenty for virtually any gig.

The price through Amazon was better than anything I could buy locally.",2
9226,"The sound from this amp is not bad for it's small size (and especially the price) but what I like is the fact that you can use effect pedals with it.  If you don't mind sacrificing the portable aspect, put on a pair of decent headphones and enjoy that amplified sound with your effects since the only on-board controls are overdrive control, tone & volume. I plugged a couple of Danelectro pedals into it, a Digitech RP-50, used a pair of Shure headphones, and in a few minutes came up with a new rock riff I plan to finish into a complete song...thanks HoneyTone!  I haven't clipped this little thing to my belt and walked around the room jammin' yet, but that's next!",2

9242,"I was hesitant to buy such a low priced instrument, but the dealer has a 30 day no questions asked return policy.
I bought mine from K&K, which is a vendor on Amazon and eBay. It's cheaper to get it on eBay. No tax and free shipping.

I am very impressed with the quality of this instrument in this price range. The tone is good even without plugging it in. Be advised though, that this has a passive pickup, rather than the active battery powered one in the fully electric model. I have one of those, too, and love it, and that's why I got this, to try it out. And, to have a beater rather than always playing and traveling with my very good violin. You can't tell from the picture, but the black color paint has a subtle glitter effect, which looks great.

This model will be great for a gig when playing with other amplified instruments. I didn't get any feedback on my Bugera V5 tube amp until I had the gain up to 5. So it work well with that.

The case is also good quality. There is nothing about this package that screams ""cheap"", except maybe for the bow. I'm not using it, as I have two other really good and expensive bows. If you want to buy a good bow to use with this violin, you have to try one in person at a music store to find the right one for you. They all have a different feel. And, there is a big difference between cheap bows and good ones, so be prepared to pay at least as much or even much more for a good bow, as for this whole violin. It's a good investment if you're going to be serious about playing. Don't skimp on the bow! That's where the sound is produced.

You may luck out with this package and get a decent bow. In that case, the first time you use it, use a LOT of rosin to get it going, and keep re-applying it. This is normal.

You will have to constantly tune it until you break in the new strings. After a day or so the strings will stretch and stabilize with the body of the fiddle, and it should stay in tune nicely. I like that it has 4 fine tuners on the tailpiece. This violin could probably benefit from putting better strings on it, too. The G string in particular doesn't sound so good. I just got the D'Addario Prelude J810 set of strings on Amazon for my other violin at around $15, which is a great deal.

For 120 bucks you really can't go wrong. The instrument itself is fairly well made and plays like a more expensive violin, especially with a little reverb on an amp.

On the downside, the shoulder rest is pretty lousy and you're going to want to replace that right away. Amazon sells a really good one, the Everest EZ, for around $14.

My bet is that their regular acoustic violins are similar in quality and would make a good starter violin for a student at around $100. But, I would go for the extra $20 and get the acoustic-electric. You'll have more fun playing around with amplification and effects.",2

9254,"This is my second audio interface. As my studio and my skills grew, I needed to upgrade my AI. I previously had a PreSonus AudioBox 22VSL. It was a powerful little unit with some occasional dropout problems. I needed more mic preamps and inputs. The logical choice would have been to buy the next model up in the PreSonus line (44VSL or 1818VSL) or Mackie Blackbird, etc. I also want to record in 192k which was only available in the M-Audio ProFire 2626 at an affordable price.

Setup & Connectivity: I knew there had been complaints about connectivity issues in the past with this device. I'm running a Mac Mini with OS X 10.8.2. so I can only speak from my personal experience with that OS. I did my research before buying this AI. I downloaded the latest driver from M-Audio's website. I also changed my ProFire settings by excluding all analog outs except for 5/6 using that for my monitors and sub. This eliminates the master volume from controlling everything and it only controls the 5/6 outs for the monitors. I can use the two separate headphone volume controls individually. Please note that this is the correct way to set it up. Why on earth the default setting is for master control to control everything at the same time and at the same level is beyond me. Once that is done you just need to reconfigure the routing. But long story short, I had absolutely no connectivity issues. It took me about 15 minutes to setup. One major thing to note is that of the 16 I/Os in the rear, 8 of those are TRS and the other 8 are TRS/XLR combo I/O. This is a great feature and you usually find that on an audio interface in this price range. I give the product 5  stars for that feature alone. When you count the I/O ports in the front and the ones in the rear by counting the combo I/O ports as 2, you get 26 so it may seem a little misleading.

Sound & Quality: Ok the preamps are beyond my expectations. I barely turn the volume up two notches and I'm shaking windows. I may have to individually turn down the volume on my monitors. I do miss the PreSonus StudioLive reverb effects but that just means a little more tweeking in Pro Tools. Firewire = no latency. Trust me, there is absolutely none. This unit has an aluminum type of hard case and finish. It feels solid and looks professional (being rack mount ready is a plus). It doesn't have input level indicators other than the clipping lights so it's not flashy. I do however like the fact that its black and not red, blue, etc. I don't like a rainbow rig myself.

Verdict: I recommend this unit. I don't know how it performs on a Windows but its a winner on Mac. I can't justify paying so much for a Motu or other more expensive AIs when this bad boy is on the market. It runs my setup perfectly which consist of Pro Tools, Native Instruments Komplete 8 & Maschine, Mackie Universal Control Pro with three extenders, two Mackie MR8 Mk IIs, one KRK 10s sub, two midi keyboards, two mics, one acoustic guitar, one electric guitar, and one soprano sax.",2

I saw the Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor's web site.  I love it!  Easy to put on and take off. The rubber won't hurt your violin, bridge or strings. You can barely hear it in the next room.  You can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge.

If you can't manage measuring your scale, you probably shouldn't be adjusting your own truss rod.

Only complaint is if your going to give a pocket that big, perhaps the designers should have added a few pockets inside the big pocket so that you can organize your musical and non musical stuff. For the price though you cannot go wrong.",2

9297,"This was the second one of these that I bought.  Not because there's anything wrong with the first one, it's just a solid strap.  I picked up the first one at a Guitar Center well over a decade ago, I spent some time trying to find a cool looking strap to put onto my ESP B206SM and in the end I decided that the less gaudy straps suited the guitar better.  That's not a lightweight guitar either, it's a big piece of work.  Comfort has never been an issue, I've worn it for hours on end without a problem, it's not going to be digging into your neck/shoulders.  It's just quality stuff and I'm probably going to grab a few more of them.  I don't expect I'll ever need to replace any of them.  Out of the two that I have right now, one of them has been used liberally for over ten years but they're both almost perfectly identical.  The way I can tell which is the older one is because at some point I must have put that thin adjustable part on like some kind of idiot so it's a little bunched up there lol.  It otherwise has no signs of wear or age.",2

9300,"I've been a guitarist for 25 years and I've also constructed some pedals and synthesizers of my own. Behringer makes great pedal's for a great price! Its true, the case is plastic (not sure what type) but its hard plastic. Slide switch's feel a little cheap, but again for the price I'm not complaining. I have no concerns as far as the pedal falling apart. It comes with some unique sounding echos. GET IT!",2
9301,"There's hype, and then there's real physics. Guitarists who are not electrical engineers like myself are vulnerable to fall for ""snake oil"" remedies for audio woes, and something like ""conductive vinyl cladding"" might sound like a scam. But in this case, it's a big deal.

Shielding is not so much an issue with guitar cords as microphonics and cable capacitance. Using the wrong cable with a high-impedance guitar amp will cause your trebles to get muddy, and as you move around, the cable will act like a microphone, amplifying every slink and slap against the stage through your speakers.

Any two pieces of metal (such as the two wires inside a cord) will act as a capacitor. The tone control on a guitar is just a capacitor wired in series with a volume pot. If your guitar cord is a good capacitor, you'll find that turning down the volume on your guitar just murders your highs. This cord is well-made, from an electrical standpoint, and even on a cheap guitar like my Squier, holds on to the highs as you lower the instrument volume.

At the high impedances found on (especially cheaper and older) guitars, cables also act like electret microphones as the conductors rattle around inside the shield. The conductive vinyl cladding indeed does bleed off extra charge that accumulates inside the shield (tribocharging), and minimizes mechanical noise.

Fancier, more expensive cables from Monster and Mogami are no more advanced in their design than this, and while I'm sure they perform measurably better (as they claim to), there is an important difference between ""measurable"" and ""audible."" You want some money left over to buy strings and beer. I'm not convinced that a $75 cable sounds two or three times as good as this.

I've observed, as have other reviewers, that the cord tangles and snags easily, but it also looks cool, and I'm willing to give it a little slack for being fashionable. But beware if you have cats: not only does a fabric-clad cord feel especially tempting to tiny claws, it's also more difficult to clean than rubber, should you leave it coiled on the floor and should a hairball be ejected onto it. Again, it looks and sounds good, so I'm still happy with it.",2

9312,"Nice pedal! I mostly use this to boost or EQ the piezo sound of my electric guitar. You can use this pedal as a booster or turn up the gain to get some crunch. But don't buy it if you're looking for a lot of gain, this is not really an overdrive pedal although this can be used to kick your overdrive pedal or overdriven amp into higher gear. This is a good pedal to have on your board for clean, semi-clean guitar work.",2
9313,So far so good... Didn't feel as nice as the planet waves model,2
9314,"Extremely flexible. In Manual mode, you can program each pedal separately using the knobs (like you would on a  discrete pedalboard) and make the perfect tone with ease. The awesome thing is that three of the pedals can be configured as delays, and they all melt together into a sea of ping-pong echoes. I don't even use the presets - it's way more fun to just dial in what I need. It's also convenient to use - throw the board and the AC adapter (not included - you'll want to buy it separately) into a bag and I'm ready to go. And it sounds amazing with both my MIM Stratocaster and Epiphone Les Paul Tribute going through a Fender Blues Jr. amp.",2

Love it",2
9330,Included basket may not house your microphone; however this is a very durable shockmount. I was able to swap the basket out for the one that came with the stock Blue Bluebird and it works like a charm now.,2
9331,"TASCAM picked the ball where BLUE microphones left off, and they really did a good job.

THE GOOD: Beyond the great good looks on this microphone you'll find outstanding digital audio quality that shows across many recording apps. I have tried it with the native TASCAM PCMRecorder you can download for free at the iTunes store. I also have tried it with the iSayWhat? app, iAudition, iPhone 4's built in recording app and even the new Blue's FiRe app with amazing results. The independently movable condenser microphones are awesome for a truly stereo experience and the input volume control is very handy and feels good in your hand.

THE BAD: As some other reviewers have said, some iPhone cases won't allow you to insert your TASCAM iM2 all the way through which could result in a loose connection, so if you have a thick case I recommend you to get the thinest you can find. Mine works just fine.

THE UGLY: Once the TASCAM iM2 is inserted into your iPhone, the earphones jack will be disabled for which you won't be able to monitor your recording in real time. Big hassle if you are a singer or voice over talent and really need to monitor what's getting into your recording. Hopefully future models will address this issue and turn the TASCAM iM2 into an even more powerful recording machine.

Over all, highly recommended.",2
9332,"Item works perfectly, as advertised and takes up little room on my pedal board. Quick response in tuning. I've been using it as a kill switch as well. Very happy with this little guy.",2
9333,"Bought this (at the store, not on Amazon) after trying out several entry-level ukuleles at our local guitar store.  I am a guitar player, and wanted to get an instrument for my daughter to learn on, and for me to play as well. The improvement in tone between the cheaper ukuleles and this one is really startling.  Kala has a solid spruce-top model for about $50 more, but that was only slightly better/louder tone.  The concert-length neck makes it much more comfortable for me to play than a regular soprano, but it still has the sweet soprano tone.  The mahogany veneer is very attractive; the pictures don't do it justice.

We've had it for a couple of months now, and I'm very happy with the purchase.  I've had a ton of fun with it, and I showed it to a pro guitarist who was impressed by the tone as well.  My daughter (who just turned 5) has been practicing for 10-15 minutes a night (she gets a choice at bedtime between going straight to bed or staying up a little later to have a lesson ... guess which she chooses?), and in two months has learned about a dozen chords + basic strumming and is starting to put them together into songs (still working on smooth chord changes and a steady rhythm, not surprisingly).  It's a very comfortable instrument for small hands, easy to fret, with good intonation.  (She had previously tried learning on my Cordoba Mini, but the full-size neck on that instrument is way too wide for her hands.)",2

Reviewing Process
The R70x have been solely listened to at home through a Schiit Magni 2 Uber/Modi 2 Uber and a Matrix HPA-3u with high-quality FLAC files. I have used these for a mixture of gaming, passive listening, and active listening. I have spent enough time with them to feel comfortable sharing my opinion, but my experiences may differ from yours. Its always best to demo a headphone before purchasing, but if you're unable to I recommend at least reading other views in conjunction with this review.

Thanks to Audio Technica for the review sample.

Build & Fit
Build
The R70x feel light, flexible, and sturdy when held in hand, I can not find a reason to be worried about the longevity of them when handled. Not a squeak or a creek, a solidly built headphone from top to bottom. In addition to the solid construction, the cables are removable which allows for one of the most damage prone parts to be easily replaced. Oddly though, the cables can be inserted into either earcup without orienting the signal wrongly. Ive switched the cables a few times and the left earcup always plays the left signal and the right earcup always plays the right signal. Thats pretty neat.

Fit
The Audio Technica wing design has undergone a heap of changes throughout its tenure. Due to this its impossible to compare the R70x to past designs without making the review excruciatingly lengthy. Ill gladly compare the fit to any other Audio Technica wing design in the comments, but as for now Im going to judge it solely as its own entity.

Without going into excruciating detail, the R70x have their issues with comfort. The headphones are super light so that there is little in the way of downwards force, and the clamping force makes for a tight and secure fit. Unfortunately the pads aren't comfortable enough to stand up to the clamping force for extended listening sessions. I felt an immediate upgrade in comfort when wearing the HD600 after taking off the R70x, for instance.

The Audio Technica wing design has always been polarizing for comfort and while the R70x solve many past issues, it still lacks as a whole.

Sound Quality
Bass
As always I test the bass with the Bass Shaker test located here as my first means of seeing the driver capability for bass extension, presence, and linearity. The R70x respond from the press of the play button with a gradual volume increase towards the midbass. In comparison to the HD600, they react very similarly with the R70x seemingly having a stronger midbass presence than the HD600. Neither are bass heavy though, but Id put the bass quantity of the R70x slightly above the HD600 based on this.

With music played the bass responds nicely with a variety of genres, providing a warm and full low-end thats unobtrusive to the midrange. The texture of the bass leans soft and fuzzy which has me favoring the likes of Portishead, Steely Dan, and West Montgomery. The sub-bass is quick and extended, as evidenced by listening to James Blakes Limit to Your Love, but it lacks the visceral slam of the ZMF Vibro that I look for when listening to the likes of Above & Beyond, Flight Facilities, or Disclosure.

Overlooking the texture of the bass, the R70x driver does a great job of being quick and controlled regardless of whether Im listening to Rage Against the Machine or James Blake.

I do find something euphoric about the bass of the R70x, in the same way that I find the midrange to be within the Ad2000 - theres something that puts me at ease which I cant put my finger on.

Mids & Highs
The midrange of the R70x is clean, quick, detailed, and nearly linear across the spectrum. At times vocals lean a touch forward, but overall the sound is presented clearly, sharply, and accurately. When comparing it to the Sennheiser HD600 the R70x performs admirably next to it, sounding sharper and quicker with slightly better detail retrieval. The HD600 sounds more linear in comparison, while having a touch of warmth thats lacking in the R70x midrange. The R70x is not sterile despite lacking warmth, but it lacks the euphoric midrange that drew me to the Audio Technica sound to begin with. The midrange is an honest to the recording though, and I respect that.

The treble is extended nicely, cleanly, and with a good level of detail retrieval. Theres a hint of air throughout, moreso than I find in the HD600, which gives the feeling of a more spacious sound.

Presentation
The R70x have an exceptional soundstage in every aspect that I can think of. The R70x has an above average left and right range, music extending fully around the perceived head space. Instrument separation is top notch, I cant find a song that sounds congested in the least. Sense of air is here, modestly, but giving the music a sense of soft dissipation into the space around it. The weak spot would be soundstage depth, but even then I feel that it performs almost as well as the HD600. Lastly I find the soundstage to be accurate in positioning, making pinpointing audio cues within games a breeze.

Conclusion
The R70x is a fantastic first effort reference quality headphone that rivals the fierce competition that it faces - Sennheiser HD600, Beyerdynamic DT880, and AKG K7xx. Despite costing as much as, if not more, than all of those options, I find myself easily recommending the R70x for those wanting a balanced, detailed, and clear sound at an affordable price.",2
9343,These are really great sounding Phono cartridges. Reasonably priced and easy to install.,2

9350,I've been playing guitar for years.  This is a great less expensive option to snark tuners.  It's accurate and lights up for dark stage settings.  Cool camo coloring is what sold me and I'm happy with it overall.,2
9351,"If you are the professional musician or just starting , Snark is the answering! It 's the  most accurate tuner i have ever used in 30 + years of playing. No more looking down at your tuner on the floor,look up to a Snark!",2
9352,"Not pro quality, but more than adequate for my home studio. I don't see build quality being an issue in a home/hobby environment. The concealed cable is nice. It barely fits my AT2020, but it does fit, so no worries. Works well to isolate bumps and rattles. For the price, I don't think you can do better.",2
9353,"These strings are different.

The cobalt alloy is supposed to give higher output due to increased magnetism.  Comparing recordings on my ibanez 4 string bass, before and after, I notice increased sustain and a brighter sound.  I also notice a very clear and throaty mid and low end.  The attack also seems very strong for a punchy sound.

Likes:
- Very bright and present.
- Unique sound.
- Incredible sustain and harmonics.
- Great feel under finger.

Dislikes:
- You will need to change your EQ and/or amp settings unless you want a noticeable change in your sound.

Overall, I'm loving the cobalt alloy.  These are my go-to strings now.",2
9354,It did the trick,2

9360,"Always the BEST,One mean pickup!",2
9361,"I bought this to EQ my weather radio's output before it is sent to my computer and then streamed up to Weather Underground.  The EQ offers a decent amount of features for the very economical price.  My only complaint is that I wish it had more than 12dB boost or cut.  Since I am trying to cut down on the background HISS I am getting with my reception, it would have been a lot more effective if the device provided the more standard 20dB boost or cut.

The full compliment of LEDs on the unit looks very impressive when it is operating and the sliders also have LEDs in them that double as a frequency analyser.

Overall I can't complain for the price.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the lack of the standard 20dB boost or cut and the fact that the unit is all plastic and because it has an external power supply it is a feather weight.",2
9362,Wound G set.. that is smooth and plays in tune really well.. Good price for the wound g set here. Kinda hard to find in stores,2
9363,"only problem, the wood stems break quickly... well, that is the problem with many great things",2
9364,"I have been using FingerEase for a few years now and I must say that I almost couldn't live without it. It has many uses, I first purchased it many years ago on a whim, just to use it as a string lubricant hoping it would help me play faster and reduce the irritation on my fingertips when sliding my fingers on the strings. Let me tell you, it did indeed help with those problems, but it took me a little bit to discover it's most helpful use. My hands are almost always sweaty, so early on in my playing my strings never lasted very long. I would either have one break on me in a week or two, or the strings would become flat and dull sounding long before they should've. This was early on, when I didn't know much about the guitar, so I didn't realize that it was my sweaty hands causing these problems. Simply by chance I picked up some FingerEase at my local music store. Without me even noticing at first the life of my strings was at least doubled. I kept using it to reduce friction and cut down on,the sliding sound of my fingers against the strings, and slowly I started to notice my strings lasting longer. This product does a great job keeping strings clean, noise free, all while making them smoother to the touch. I tried elixer strings once or twice and I loved the way that they felt and the ease of playing with them. They are quite pricey though, and the coating never lasts long. This product will turn any strings you want into elixers, adding the same sort of coating, but without you having to worry about it coming off, because you can just give it another spray. I use Ernie Ball Cobalt strings, which sound wonderful, but I have read many,people complain that for the price they go dead fast, but I have yet to have that problem. A 4 dollar can of this lasts me nearly a year with liberal use, and makes my 10+ dollar strings last much longer. Great value for a great product A++",2

9374,"Great electronic drum amp.  If you're looking at amps with more power you should probably reconsider (unless you're getting ready to do big gigs).  This 50 watt amp will break your windows if you crank it up.  I have to play it at low volume settings to prevent damaging things (windows, ears, etc. :-).  And it's heavy-duty - big dials, good weight, big bass cone.

My only nit is that it seems to have some limits on amplifying high frequencies (which in an analog drum kit are not as prevalent and would be mic'd differently) - in electronic drum kits those can be significant - lots of kits, lots of ""non traditional"" sounds like chimes and bells and cosmic sounds.  To get the balance that sounds level to me seems to require setting the treble dial at max.

Prior to buying this amp, I used ""guitar"" amps for drums - some really good ones like Line 6 - but for the money and size I would not trade this amp for any other I've used when it comes to electronic drums.",2

9379,"The Classic 57 pickup came in quick time from Amazon. I installed a pair, 57 classic (neck) and 57 Classic + (bridge) into a VSB Epiphone Sheraton 2. The tonal difference from the original pickups were: This 57 classic offered high end clarity on notes, and bottom end tightness, a bit more than the original. The sound is pristine but vintage, it handles overdrive and distortion perfectly. Best sounding pickups I've played..from PRS pickups to Strat single coils and hum buckers, to Ibanez, to Epiphone...these Gibson 57's are the best. If Gibson got one thing right it's their tonal spectrum on pickups.",2

9384,"This is the first time I tried these strings, medium tension seems to be the same as normal tension but not able to confirm that, my son likes them because they are slightly stiffer so they give him less string buzz.  I'm an experienced nylon string knotter, and these strings were unusally short for my Canadian classic guitar, not sure why.  Would have liked to see them about an inch longer, but I was able to get them on and so far no issues.",2
9385,Very good product and very accurate. The only thing I would like to see changed is the power on/off .  You must twist it.. Would be great to have that as a push button.,2
9386,it's tri pack with great quality strings on good deal! i purchased 2 of this set and it works great. it sounds balanced (warm and bright). i prefer change strings often so i can't afford to do that with expensive set of strings. this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good! anyone needs string go for it!,2

I've recorded twice with both snare on the kit, once with an explosive jazz drummer and once with a Jungle/Break drummer, so plenty of rim shots and clicks in each session and these clamps worked perfect.",2
9397,Strap works well. I've had it for a year and there's no problems with it. Great price.,2
9398,"Good case. Though intended for a dreadnaught, it fits a Breedlove Concert-size guitar very well (a little looseness side to side at the widest point, but not much, and the rest is held in place very well, without being too tight or too loose).  It has extra latches compared to the photos, which is good (one in the back, another at the bottom toward the back).  Has a nice space allowance for the end-pin at the bottom of the guitar, and also for the typical location of pickup controls on the upper side of the guitar - so that the padding doesn't press into volume knobs, or the end pin doesn't cut the fabric on the padding.  Well thought out.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, I wish the latches had a bit more force required to release them, as is, I would put duct tape over them if shipping on an airplane. One other reason why it isn't 4 stars ... even though it is the better ""5-ply"" wood structure according to my research, it is still not as thick a plywood as an old ""Everest"" brand Canadian-made case for my classical.  I wish they still made those.  In short, this Yamaha DELUXE version is a good case.  I also got 40 off on an Amazon special short-term price, so I'm happy with it.  It is heavy - but it will protect.  Way better than the junk most music stores sell you for 60 to 80.",2
9399,A regular customer for this item.,2
9400,"I had a couple of pairs of the original K240's, and though these feel slightly cheaper, they're actually a whole lot cheaper (in price). I once bought a pair of $30 Samson headphones that broke after about a year because they were made of such cheap plastic. The K240 design, intact in this incarnation, seems to hold up really well over time.

How do they sound? Great. Neutral, not bass heavy, not hyped in the highs. I like them. I also have a pair of K701's, and the K240s sound slightly duller and less extension in the low lows, but I use them for tracking (and making mic placement decisions) without hesitation.",2

9405,"i own 4 of these for my small club pa system and they are perfect, i use them every night of the week and they get alot of road use and hold up well. even had one jump out of a moving van going 25 miles per hour and it survived!",2
9406,"This is a very interesting keyboard. Like the Korg NanoKey2, it features keys that don't pivot(as a piano key does) but just move vertically only slightly giving it a feel halfway between a pad and a key. This has the advantage of allowing great speed since less movement is involved. Unlike the Korg, these are full sized keys and have a smooth feel allowing the best glissando of any midi keyboard. Like the Korg, the black keys have the same feel as the white keys since they do not pivot(on a piano, the black keys, being shorter, have less of a mechanical advantage and thus have a different feel from the white keys). But there is a very important difference as far as the feel goes: Even though the keys are full length and don't pivot, they will not tilt as the Korg keys do no matter where you strike the key! The entire key moves up and down without any tilt, quite impressive! Unlike the Korg, this has polyphonic aftertouch that works well, while the Korg has no aftertouch. What is the difference between regular aftertouch and polyphonic aftertouch you ask? Regular aftertouch just means that as you hold the key down after you strike the note, the note will stay on until you release it and if you vary the holding pressure, it will produce an effect, but there is only one such effect for the entire keyboard, so if you are playing a chord, there will be one aftertouch signal produced by the most forceful key. Polyphonic aftertouch allows you to vary the holding pressure that you exert on the key after striking it and the device will respond to the changes in pressure while you hold that key down AND you may produce an effect for each key held independently, so, for example, you could vibrate only one note out of a chord. If you try this at first you may think it doesn't work, but it will only work with some synths or virtual instruments and not others. I had to try quite a few before I found one that allowed it. But when it works, it works well and allows a greater level of expression. Another advantage of polyphonic aftertouch is that by using pressure sensors under each key, the effect works better overall. I have found most mini keyboards have no aftertouch while the full sized keyboards, like Alesis and Samson, have great regular aftertouch. On this keyboard, the aftertouch is awesome! The pitchbend and modulation buttons also respond to pressure variation. The Korg has one nice feature this doesn't have: the octave buttons light up and change color indicating which octave you are in. The Xkey octave buttons do not light up.
This uses a USB type A(the normal USB that plugs into your computer) to USB MICRO-B. This is the first MIDI device I have seen that uses the MICRO-B(many use the MINI-B and some use USB type B). The MICRO-B plugs into the right side of the keyboard, underneath a bit. It is very awkward to pull the plug out, since it lies flush to the device. You could wrap a string around it as you plug it in(there is room for that) to give you something to tug on, I suppose, but I find this a minor annoyance(do not pull it out by the wire!).
The aluminum frame is fantastic! When I read that it was made of aluminum, I thought it would be sheet metal but it is a solid piece of thick aluminum! There is a strong plastic housing underneath, only in the top portion, that contains the circuitry. The anodizing is very beautiful and durable. This is a great looking keyboard!
If you pay extra, you get a very sturdy carrying case. If you have already purchased this without the case and you would like to get one, you may notice nobody in the entire USA seems to sell them! I looked and looked and could not find the case sold separately....until I checked Amazon.co.uk, which is Amazon in the UK. They have the case sold separately for about the same additional price here. If you have never used Amazon.co.uk(you can find the link at the bottom of every Amazon.com page) it is just as easy as the USA version and you can even make the purchase in US dollars using your usual credit card. Of course, shipping will cost more.
So, this is a wonderful addition to the MIDI keyboard market. Is there anything else on the horizon to push the envelope like this? Yes, the K-708 QuNexus introduces tilt in addition to polyphonic aftertouch. But that uses silicone pads so it has a different feel(it won't give you the awesome glissando that the XKey does). It also costs more, but not too much more.
Be sure to download the software editor for the Xkey. The editor is called ""Xkey+"" and to download it go to www.cme-pro.com and on the pull-down tab for the Xkey, select ""Docs and Downloads"". There are versions for both Windows and Macs. The editor is really nice with interesting features. When the Xkey is connected and you open the editor your serial number is automatically detected and you can check if there is a firmware upgrade. You can upgrade the firmware with a single click(and one more click to accept), which is the first time I have seen that, since others usually require a file download. After upgrading, you must disconnect the Xkey for it to ""take"". Also, some synths interpret aftertouch signals strangely. For example, ""Far East"" in Mixcraft plays out of tune if aftertouch is engaged no matter how you play. In such cases, simply turn off the aftertouch with the software editor. It is easy to go back to engaging aftertouch either directly or by clicking on ""restore factory settings"".",2

9410,ok,2
9411,"As a gigging nylon-string player, I'm always looking for the holy grail of acoustic guitar amps. Is the Mini sent from heaven?

Compared to most acoustic amp designs, the Loudbox is pretty bare bones: a piezo channel, XLR channel, AUX input, basic digital effects (chorus and reverb), DI out but no effects loop, notch filter or phantom power. The sealed cabinet is covered with brown vinyl and brushed aluminum, imparting a quasi-retro vibe. It appears more attractive than the product pictures. If you drag it to gigs youll find it pleasantly light and small. Unfortunately, the vinyl and underlying wood are easily damaged by gentle pressure from straps and carts. It's the most delicate amp I've owned.

PIEZO TONE: I set the tone controls flat, jacked in my Takamine LTD2012 Classical and Hirade TH8SS (classicals with Cool Tubes preamps) and my ears pinned back with powerful output. Loudbox is well deserved. The master volume was barely cracked but this little guy puts out. Unfortunately, that big tone sounded closer to an electric guitar than a classical: heavy bass, bright lower trebles, weak mids, quacky tone and compressed dynamics. Obviously, under-saddle piezo pickups are no studio mic but it should sound better than this. So I diddled the controls and it improved but I couldn't dial in a pleasing tone. The best timbre with my Hirade classicals was bass-11:00, mid-3:00 and treble-9:00 (clock face orientation).

Some acoustic guitar amps allow the tweeter to be disabled and I suspect the Mini's overly bright tone would benefit from cutting the tweeter from the circuit. As a point of comparison, Cool Tube piezo pickup tone from my 23-year old Trace Elliot TA50R is significantly more natural, complex and sustained. Cool Tube piezo tone from my SHEN-CPK-8T is drop-dead gorgeous. Perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and de-piezo the tone? They cost twice as much as the Mini so they should sound better, but Im surprised the Fishman lagged so far behind.

I plugged in my mid-1990s Trace Acoustic TAP-1 preamp into the Mini and was able to dial in better tone, albeit still not as good as my ancient TA50R. I also tested my Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. and it rendered more natural classical tone. So you can get decent classical guitar tone if you're willing to carry another box to your gig.

The Loudbox series is highly regarded by many acoustic guitarists so I figured I must be missing the mark somehow. I suspected the Mini was optimized for steel-string guitar tone, so I borrowed a friend's Takamine EF341S and I was right: steel-string reproduction is significantly better than nylon-string.

REVERB: The single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter and harsher sounding, even when mixed in sparingly. Wish this amp had an effects loop as any budget half rack unit will sound better.

MIC TONE: I don't normally use a mic for casual gigs but this is feature is handy when you need to mic a friend or blend in a small internal mic for extra ambience. The Mini lacks phantom power so I installed a battery in my Shure 849 condenser mic, set tone controls flat and was greeted with surprisingly natural mic tone. I also tried my ancient Shure SM57 dynamic mic with similar good results, albeit that mic needed a little treble cut. As a point of comparison, the Mini whips my both my TA50R and SHEN-CPK-8T in terms of mic tone.

FINAL BLURB: Unfortunately, straight out of the cardboard, the Loudbox is not ready for serious nylon-string reproduction. The Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. significantly improves tone, but that's another two or three bills. Nevertheless, the Mini is one of the best buck to tone ratio deals and is an excellent amp for steel-string acoustic guitars.",2

However, I would not use this bag to check-in on an airplane.  If your drummer sat it, your uke would probably break.  You'll want a true 5 star hard case for that.  But, those cost more than a cheap uke itself.

For tossing in the trunk or riding on the bus -- it's great.

They are great earplugs and highly rated for a good reason. When I got these DUBs, they had a lot to compete with. I figured that at minimum I'd have a spare pair by getting these, but now I expect to use these as my primary pair.  The ear protection is excellent. It offers the right degree of attenuation and allows sounds to remain undistorted. They are easier to insert and remove. They are more comfortable to wear. Even the case is less awkward since you won't end up with rubbery pieces that keep the earplugs inside, making them awkward to remove. I'd like to be able to say that these are better in all respects, but my old ones still offer the advantage of multiple inserts for different levels of attenuation. Although the case with the DUBs is easier to use, the case with the MusicSafe is easier to clip onto something and easier to carry. But as far as their primary function goes, these are nothing short of top notch.",2

9471,"This pedal rocks- while it has the looks of the Big Muff, I actually find it far different sound-wise. This is an overdrive on tube-steroids- it really has a massive sound with more clarity and definition than the Big Muff (don't get me wrong... the big muff is one of my favorites, but that does Corgan, and the English Muff'n does Angus.)  And while some other reviewers have complained that she's a bit of a ""one trick pony,"" I actually think that the Muff'n has a lot of range when it comes to using the guitar's volume knob. One of my favorite aspects of this pedal is that if you roll off the volume on the guitar and keep the gain on the Muff'n at about 8:00, you can get a wonderfully complex but low-volume overdrive with a deluxe reverb amp. This is a great way to get some nice tube-crunch from Fender Amps at lower (practice) volumes where they are normally very clean sounding or even underpowered.

Quality-wise, this pedal lives up to the usual Electroharmonix reputation- with the same folded aluminum chase as the big muff, the Muff'n feels solid, and the tube-guard is bullet (and boot) proof. I like that you can change the tubes out as well, with the option for more gain with the 12AX7 tubes. I have JJ's in mine and they sound great, but all tubes sound a bit different so you can change to taste. The only weird thing is the proprietary power source, so tape that baby to your board and don't lose it!! And remember, tubes take awhile to warm up, so plug the pedal in for a few minutes before using it to avoid uneven sound (at least on mine.) Once she warms up though, the Muff'n really... uh... cooks.",2
9472,"I originally bought the DP008 and found it to be rather frustrating for my purposes. Sound quality and features were very complete, but if you just want to capture audio and then move it to Audacity or something on your computer you have to mixdown and master your project files which is pretty time consuming and pointless unless you're recording demos or studio musicians and mixing it all together.

This is an ideal field recorder at a very reasonable price. It powers up and you can start recording almost immediately. When you're done recording you can pull the SD card and edit/playback the files on your computer without having to do any converting or mastering. Sweet! Sound quality has been great, the built in mics are quite high quality (you can watch sample videos on Youtube which compare it to the Zoom H4n and you will be hard pressed to hear any difference.)

Also handy for people recording meetings/podcasts/other field work are the easy to use mark function and playback speed controls. If you have to scour your tape for good moments, you can mark in the moment, then later jump to that. You can also loop and adjust playback speed if you're transcribing or logging your audio.

The big difference between this and other recorders is that the build quality is clearly cheaper- it just feels like a chunk of plastic and the buttons are pretty stiff. If you aren't too rough with it, that won't be a factor but some folks need something more rugged than the DR40. That's the one key compromise in this device and I think that's a fair tradeoff.

I also like that it can draw power from USB so you don't need to buy a separate AC adapter",2
9473,"I got this at a great price so decided to give a strobe tuner a try. If you're accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it. While it may technically be more accurate than the cheaper vibration tuners, this advantage is of limited use given that the tuning of guitars still has to have some compromise from perfect in order to be well intonated. One advantage over the clip on tuners (by the way, you can't beat Snarks for the price) is that because it is electronically connected to the guitar it is not affected but other instruments that may be playing at the same time. I've noticed that while trying to tune when playing live by clip on tuner seemed to get ""confused"" by other instruments.",2

It took me a short while to figure out the controls, but once that's done it IS actually fairly intuitive. I do wish it showed the record level when actually recording rather than before, but that is just a preference.  found no issues with overloading and all recordings came out clean and undistorted.

9499,"I wasn't aware that one of our church worship team guitars was feeding his Hi Z pickup into a Lo Z mic line.  I just happened to learn that there was a problem with the sound board operator properly adjusting the output level of his guitar (not enough sound) in the mix.  That's when I discovered the impedance mismatch.  After a little investigation, considering a limited budget for effecting the correction, I selected this direct box and we were not disappointed!  Output level came right up, where it was supposed to be, very good sound quality, made the right choice.  Problem solved!",2
9500,"This is a truly outstanding mic. Not only for its cost but its size.

I gig often playing both Alto and Tenor saxophone and this mic was the best microphone investment I have ever made. The sound quality is crystal clear and once you find the sweet spot for your instrument it picks up all ranges and all volumes fantastically. I highly recommend this mic.

Ok, so there is just one very minor thing..

There is a module type thing at the end of the mic cable that will drag on the floor if you don't do anything prevent this. Personally I just loop it in my belt to keep it off the ground and it doesn't bother me, but it may annoy others.

Also, be warned, this mic requires phantom power.",2

9508,"I'm a bass player primarily, and I have never owned an electric guitar (have a few acoustics).  I've dabbled on Casinos for many years, and always found them to be highly playable.  I'm 6'5"" and have big fingers, yet I find playing solo or chords to be easy on this instrument.  The action is wonderful, and, how can you go wrong with cherry red?

The action is low but not too low.  Good volume from the pickups, smooth frets, lightweight (hollow-body guitar), all-around pleasure to play and hear.  I still love bass #1, but this guitar is absolutely a favorite in my collection.",2
9509,"I provide music ministry for St. Germaine Catholic Church in Prescott Valley, AZ.  Several times recently, my microphone would cut out.  The problem appeared to be with the microphone cable, yet there were no signs of the cable having any loose or broken wires.  This tester proved the problem was with the contacts in the connector at the microphone end.  They were apparently slightly enlarged (female contacts) allowing occasional open circuit conditions on any one of the three contacts.  This tester proved that just a slight movement of the connector resulted in one of the three contacts becoming open circuit.  I purchased a new connector and now the cable is perfect again.  Ringing out the cable with an ohm meter had not shown the problem, since the actual wires were not the issue.",2

9518,I was looking for a pair of black Tele style knobs. These only came in 4 packs but the price was right. They're smaller than Tele knobs but they seem fine  for my needs- push pull on my PRS. They don't have a screw to lock them down but they fit snugly so overall I'm satisfied so far.,2

9522,Works and is the perfect buy,2
9523,"Maybe not every guitar player's cup 'o tea, but these are perfect for me. Makes an electric guitar feel and play a little more like an acoustic. That makes transitioning easier. I play blues oriented rock, and have no trouble bending these strings.",2
9524,"It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.

First of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on yand off.

Next! I wish they'd just name the settings ""clean"", ""overdrive"", ""distortion"", and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.

Then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.

Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.

None of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.

Update: Roland basically fixed my important concerns with the new version of the Micro Cube, the GX. it's over a pound lighter, the power switch is on top where it belongs, plus it's got more features like the Cube Jam software ( which I don't really use but it looks cool). I'm not thrilled with the built in effects but they're still fun to mess with and you can always use pedals instead.

So basically, the Micro Cube GX is a strong buy, the older version you'll want to avoid (my opinion).

Buy the one that says ""CUBE"" across the grill and you'll have a great little practice amp..",2
9525,This is a nice rack. Very easy to install and it's sturdy. I would recommend this item.,2

9529,"Probably the most underrated powered DI for live work. No need for a battery if you have functional phantom power on your mix console. Dual attenuators help keep Blaster the bass player tamed and over-compensated volume programming on keyboards under control. RUGGED housing.

Despite what interwebz ""gurus"" say these Behringer DIs are workhorses. They do the job, do it well, remain functional ALL night and over many years. No. They are NOT Countryman/Radial/BSS. SO?!? They work. They're very affordable and relatively durable as long as you aren't stacking them to hold up your car while you change your flat tire or using them for batting practice they should last and function well for a long time.",2
9530,Love these cables. Really save room on the pedal board.,2
9531,"This is an absolutely fantastic mic. I'm buying more. Wonderful for recording guitar amps. Unbelievable sounds come through them into the audio interface ending at the software you're using. I even tried garage band with a Scarlett 2i2 and the mic is flipping fantastic. I used this mic and a kick drum mic on two different tube amps and got a really nice tone mix. I'm even using it for vocals, my nice condenser mic was sounding too hallow and roomy, so I used this mic and got a super up front in your face sound that then sounded amazing when I mixed it with a tad bit of fuzz, compression, and reverb. Also, it works well on floor tom, snare, and symbols. Really is a work horse of a mic, at a fraction of the cost compared to the real sure SM 57 version. Long story short, its simply a true full golden tone in your face kind of sound.",2

It has a single bar in the back, few drums these days even put them in as they are not necessary to playing.  Tipper is nice.  I got two of these due to slow shipping and an approaching birthday.  Both came from the same importer, laugh's on me.  That's okay, we had another drummer in the family.  Clue:  If you try to cancel an order with Amazon and you are not sure it did, it didn't.  Love the bo rons.  Saga includes the Oklahoma Guarantee with every drum:  If your drum breaks in half, you own both halves or something like that.  It's in the package.",2
9536,good quality.works fine,2
9537,"This is sold as a separate companion accessory for the Korg OT-120 Orchestral Tuner, though I imagine it would work with most electronic tuners that have a 1/4"" phone mic input.

For my application it works great.  I wanted a mike that I could put in direct contact with my instrument, so that I could tune in an otherwise noisy environment without having stray sounds confuse the tuner.  This clip-on mike has a softly-padded jaw that opens wide enough to attach to the headstock of every instrument I've tried it on, from charango, to banjo, to guitar, to bass.  It picks up vibrations directly from the instrument, and pretty much ignores room noise, and I've successfully used it to tune even when other loud music was playing around me.

My only caveat is that it's high-end response tends to fall off little sooner than I'd like.  The mike easily picks up everything from the low B on my 5-string acoustic bass guitar, to the high E on my mandolin, but by the time you get to that high E you have to pick a little harder for the mike to catch the sound.  With hualyacho, which has some strings a fifth higher than the mandolin, I had to hold the mike against the body of the instrument to pick up the highest strings, which was awkward, but it worked.

However, for most standard stringed instruments, this a great mike to use with the Korg tuners, when you have to tune in  the midst of chaos.",2
9538,"I have tryed a number of pick's and the textured ones seem to work for me.  I have dexdarity problems, Regular pick's without grips come out of my hands cause I am unable to control them,  So I needed something with a little more weight to it  allthough my fingures want to move around a little bit  I love these picks  now I can move my thumb and index fingers back to the bottom of the pick,  and it feels comfortable,  I used to do that with other (non textured)  pick's, And I kept droping them.

These pick's are a must have,  allso, sinse theire heavier then other pick's,  these and the Ice pick's really build up Your hand's And finger's.

9541,an inexpensive addition to my stage lighting.,2
9542,"I bought mine 6 years ago, and it works just as great today as it did the first day I bought it. A lot of my peers use Boss TU-3's, and the Pitch Black is so much smoother, and it's true bypass!! It also runs a little cheaper than the Boss, and is easier to read.

May not be as fancy as the Polytune, but who really needs to tune all 6 strings at once?",2
9543,"One of the better value-priced stands out there.  The pros include excellent height adjustability (particularly good standing height), sturdy and steady metal music rest with good width and deep bottom lip, and the ability to adjust the base from narrow to very wide.  Cons include the plastic parts at key points.  No problem so far, but reports of failures aren't comforting.

As comparisons to Manhasset's stands are frequent, and because I also chose between the On-Stage and Manhasset myself, let me offer this:  Manhasset makes excellent stands.  They are made to take daily use and survive in tough environments (like schools) for decades.  You can buy parts for them and repair them.  On the other hand, I find they can slip in height relatively easily and you have to crank the tray tension to keep the tray from sagging if you are using books and not light sheet music.  There's a reason they sell shaft locks and tray locks for these things.  The fixed-base models are steady.  I do not like their folding models.  Finally, you will pay more for the Manhasset, 2x more, on average. The On-Stage is equivalently well-made, save for the plastic parts.  A little care goes a long way.

Recommended for home use and light portability.  Fine for heavy use and abuse if you can deal with repairing it yourself.",2
9544,"I ordered this Item and have been using it for a couple of months in a band with Songbook software. Yes its is made of plastic but is more sturdy than some would lead you to believe and it works just as advertised. No you do not want to let a 4 ton elephant stand on it but lets be adults here.  I did not write a review until now because now I have a reason to give them 5 stars. I was using it on a windows 7 PC with no problems but was forced to purchase a new laptop and of course it has the dreaded Windows 8. (Not a fan and yes I have been working with computers and IT for 25 years). This pc did not have bluetooth on it so I had to use the dongle that came with it and I have the V4 (newest) version of the pedal. Windows 8 sees it as a keyboard so immediately asks for a pairing code to be typed in, kinda hard with it being a pedal and all. I sent an email to PageFlip Support asking if it worked with Win8 and was pleasantly surprised when not only did I receive a reply in less than 24 hours but was also informed that Yes it will work with Windows 8 and a new dongle based on bluetooth 3.0 was being sent to me FREE of charge. Two days later it arrives and works like a champ. I found it very refreshing that a company these days not only stands behind their product as Windows changes every other week but sent me the corrective HARDWARE free of charge to fix it. So 5 stars and Major Kudos to PageFlips customer service which these days in the US is severely lacking.",2

9552,"I love D'Addario strings, however, this particular set when installed on my 28.625"" scale 8-string - the top .74 string was not wound far enough to reach the nut. This left me with roughly 1/3"" of the string that does not match (Pic). I'm honestly not sure if this is an isolated incident or if all packs will yield the same result. I will give them another try in hopes of a better set, but if this is the standard then D'Addario should really consider the extended scale of 8-string guitars and ensure the strings are wound far enough.",2

9556,"Fantastic wall mount! I bought these to make space in my music room & boy was I glad that I did! I mounted them directly behind my guitar rack instead of having two additional guitar stands that took up very valuable real estate in my tiny music room. As for the quality of these, top notch! I had one before that broke off & I came into the room with my $1500 Dobro sitting on the ground. Thankfully it's a tank and honestly couldn't find any damage on it, but it could of been worse. That is why when I bought these I didn't mind spending a bit extra to feel safe. In addition to all of the above, these just look good! A lot of wall mounts look stupid or ugly, this is actually quite stylish! Overall I give this 10/10.",2
9557,I do a lot of strumming and these work great. Love the brand and support the strings and picks! Sturdy and flexible.,2
9558,"I bought this mic for simple recording of acoustic guitar & vocals straight into a PC.  The sound is smooth, rich, and full on both the intrument interface....and the mic.  Remember, because of the interface capability, you will have to tie the two mono tracks to a stereo bus in your DAW software.  Otherwise the instrument will be on one side, and the vocals on the other during playback, (during recording, the headset monitoring ""from the mic"" is in stereo which of course you need).  Even if you're just using the mic, you still have to tie the track to a stereo bus as it only comes through on the left.  You also have to crank the mic gain up pretty high to achieve good recording levels for voice/vocals which can lead to some noise depending on your set-up, soundcard,and power quality.  So a nice USB pre-amp to go with this mic might be a big plus again depending on your set-up.  I've been very happy with this mic without a pre-amp, and I'm fairly certain you would be too.

P.S. This is a VERY sensitive, supercardioid mic!  The SP04 shock mount is a must!!!  A pop filter is HIGHLY recommended, and depending on the room...you may even want to use a wind screen to avoid air movement rumble.",2

However, FYI, you can also just use your heel tapping on the cajon for about the same sound -- you can even work on ""double-bass"" with two heels.  Sounds great, especially mic'ed.  Just take any old microphone and lay it on a cloth or t-shirt at the bottom of the inside of the cajon, and it's now mic'ed.  Simple and amazing sound.",2

9582,"When I first heard of this product, I thought it was about time we got something for Android, but I hesitated to see reviews.  The initial reviews I saw were mixed, so I waited to see if the price collapsed, and then purchased this.

My first impressions were that the unit was light, as if there was nothing inside of a thin plastic case.  That's not to say it isn't sturdy, but the general feel of it makes me handle it carefully.  The packaging was really nice, though.

I downloaded the iRig Android software and away I went.  The unit itself works wonderfully well.  No detectable latency and nice strong signal.  The short cable made it a little awkward to figure out how to place the device along with my tablet, especially since I was afraid of breaking it if it fell on the floor.

The supporting software for Android was pretty much what other reviews told me - mediocre.  The tones are just not that great.  Most of the knobs on amp simulators don't seem to really make more than a noticeable difference between all up and all down.  The pedal structure is not ideal, and the available amps in the free software are, well, okay.  They aren't awful, but not particularly great, either.  Certainly not as good as Roland's COSM (Roland Cube, BOSS Micro BR) or what I've heard from the Apple version.  Maybe more on par with amp sims from Yamaha.

The pay models need better accessibility to demo and suffer also from lack of variety.

I've done some demo recordings with the device through Audio Evolution Mobile for Android, and the result is decent after using some of that software's post-production utilities.

My opinion, for what it's worth, is that IK ought to either support this product with more software or else release the source such that people can create their own software for it.  It's one of those cases, to me, where a pretty great product is artificially limited to mediocre applications.",2

9607,"I've recently changed my mind and left the ""school of thought"" that says flatwounds should last six months or even a year - and I know that some fine players leave them on till they break, but whoa, jeez -- if you have a guitar with months-old strings, try this: play it for half an hour or so.  Now change them - new Chromes, and don't stretch them to death; I've discovered how much better flats can sound if stretched _just a bit at the nut_ - just a couple of light tugs.  Tune 'em up, and listen, and FEEL how much nicer a new set sounds and feels.  They intonate better, and when amplified, the distinction between notes in a chord is just beautiful, to my ears, anyway.

This is all imho.  Different strokes and all that - but compare the difference next time you change strings.  I change my Chromes about once a month now, sometimes more if I've played a lot.

What's so great about Chromes?  I've never heard better, for my guitars.  They feel great, they hold tune great.  They won't break you up (Pyramids are nearly 4x as much!) - they're sold everywhere, they're consistent, and I dig the color-code thing.  My mnemonic, 1st string to 6th, is:

The colors are:  S_ilver, P_urple, G_reen, B_lack, R_ed, B_rass. So just think:

S_ome
P_eople
G_ot
B_ig
R_ed

They arrived in a good time, and I'm totally satisfied.",2
9621,"I've owned a Duet2 for several years. The best feature of this unit is the adjustability of the two light heads.  Independently flex them to slightly overlapping beams and you've got a pretty wide angle spred or twist and turn them in any direction to throw a beam to light and isolate something else.  I've recently picked up a twin pack of Xtraflex2 book lights from Costco and more recently bought two Hammerheads and the Encore light from Amazon. I also own 3 of the cradle bases.

Duet2- After several years of light duty use, the switches on the Duet are acting up.  I have to press them multiple times to make a setting change or turn them on or off. This could just be my individual unit, so this issue may or may not be inherent in Duets generally. I do see tiny screws on each head, potentially facilitating switch contact cleaning if they are not sealed switches.

Encore, Hammerhead and Cradle Stand - Read no further if you are only interested in the Duet2. I don't us the lights for their exact intended purpose of lighting sheets on a music stand, but rather I'm using the Encore and the Hammerheads to evenly light the 88 keys of my Yamaha slab type stage piano. These work perfectly on their lower setting to adequately light the keys for me to see what I'm playing. The Encore and Hammerheads are in their cradles sitting on the keyboard's flat top. As the piano top is wood, the stand's magnets don't come into play, but the cradles, with their small feet, balance the lights stably enough not to warrant complaint.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to knock them over, but my piano is on a very stable stand, so there isn't a lot of bouncing or shaking going on. It's all good. Cradle magnets are strong and stick the lights tightly to ferrous surfaces. Padded clips on all units are also strong.

I'm happy with the width of the Encore's light spread in the center and the two Hammerheads on either side. On a darkened stage, my isolated and lighted hands moving over the keys are spot lighted dramatically. I only wish the Hammerheads had the shade on their backs, as does the Encore, so that the audience wound not see the LEDs directly. I have not experienced these lights eating batteries as other have stated. I do have AC adapters for them if needed, but part of the beauty of these lights is that they are completely portable and battery operated. I use the Duet2 clipped onto my small stand mounted mixer to light the board.

Color Temperature- Probably  a non-issue to most users, but as a photographer I notice these things. The Encore and Hammerheads have a lower K temperature and thus have a slightly yellowish tint. I'm using these two models in combination, so under these lights my white piano keys are uniformly colored and not objectionable.  Add the Duet into the mix and you can see a noticeable difference in color temp. The Duet casts a more whitish blue tint. Minutia? Maybe, but it's worth stating. The Duet is older. Could it maybe have started out closer to the color of my new lights? I don't know if LEDs experience color shift with age, but maybe. LEDs do dim with age, but they have great longevity.

On the whole, I have only good things to say about my Mighty Brights.  Well made, bright and innovative designs.",2
9622,"The case is very sturdy and I believe it could last years with regular use. The inside is plush and it will protect against scratching or abuse of the instrument.  The handle is strong and the clasps and the rest of the hardware is quality.  It's a solid case.

9630,"I play mandolin and guitar.  I play rock, jazz, gypsy, and bluegrass.
These picks are superb, and I prefer them over my Blue Chip TAD 601R, a $35.00 pick!
I use a wide variety of types and brands, and I'm very impressed.
Why?

The material provides a stiff, light, super controllable tool.  It is slick, allowing effortless travel over strings, and tremolo, even without a rounded point.  I don't know the material, but it feels identical to PickBoy ultex , one i also love.

The pick edge is beveled and super smooth.  This is not unlike changing the attack /strike angle just enough to improve speed.

The pick transfers a lot of power to the strings, giving a big sound, but also a bit more treble, without plink or pick click. The texture is really nice, and its one of the few picks I use with texture. Its texture is very subtle, comfortable, feels natural and helps!  The larger ""346""  size too, is great, and simply provides a nice grip for extended playing with power.

I will add, in my experience, that thick, stiff picks are something that it took me decades to not only discover, but to have the technique to use.  Imho, they require a slightly looser and more fluid grip to not hang up on strings.  Sometimes they are an adjustment for beginners used to softer more flexible picks.  The pay off is better control, accuracy, and .....yes......tone.

The pick provides great accuracy, for intricate single string runs (yes i use this on my archtop, as well as flat top, and electrics) and fast fiddle type tunes on the mandolin.

Summary: I get big round warm  sound with added clarity, and comfort.

While picks are a personal preference, these offer a huge potential return for minimal risk, imho.  Try one!",2

9634,"I am fond of lighting products, especially ones that are colorful and can be used for special occasions like holiday celebrations, raves, dance parties and more. This strobe bank is a good choice for such, though it is a single color only (which is clear up front).

This is a very small unit, smaller than my hand and very easily can be placed just about anywhere. It is lightweight too. That said, It seems to be made well and it can handle a little jostling and frequent use.

This is a small unit but it puts out a good amount of light. It has a bank of 24 LED bulbs that give it ample brightness to light up a counter or a small wall. It is not bright enough to work well in a place like a funhouse but it is a very good fit for smaller Halloween displays and the like. Because of the size, it is easy to place this light so that it is out of the way but still effective at illumination. The handle on it has a hole drilled through it so it can even be mounted on a wall or ceiling.

There is a single setting on this unit - the knob on the back that controls the strobe. This knob is easy to set and it allows you to set the strobe speed to a relatively slow strobe all the way up to shining nearly solid. It is not graduated but instead is a smooth spin so the strobe frequency can be set exactly as desired, not just close enough.

This is a neat little light that works well. It provides a good strobe effect and it is very small and lightweight so it can be placed (or hung) almost anywhere. The one catch is that it is single color and if you need more than just one color you need to purchase more units. This is a fact known up front so if you need a strobe of a specific color, at a really low price, this is a good unit for your consideration.

No programming, just select the effect you need and dial to taste.

No looking for a place to mount it where it will be positioned correctly, yet still be out of the way. It just slides right on to your mic, and it's ready to go. Very nice product.",2
9642,"I'll say first that this amp is great with the cleans. Really dynamic tone. Goes great with my Seymour Duncan Full Shred and Jazz humbuckers, which are split coil and opens up even more tone. I primarily play hard rock and metal. Anything from Randy Rhoads, Jon Donais and Syn Gates to Eric Johnson. So, after endless searching on whether or not I could dial a tone that I was looking for (high gain mainly) I just couldn't get the answer. Anyone looking for the same answer, here you go. No! It most certainly cannot get those tones by itself. It has only moderate gain (think war pigs by Black Sabbath). But, it does sound very good with my joyo ultimate drive in front! I get the sound I want when I have the extra overdrive pushing it. I had to do the same with my HT-5. Plus side to this amp, it's much louder than the ht5, better cleans, does more all together and looks fantastic. I would say add a compressor if you have one and an equalizer to dial the specifics of your tone. I thought about returning it but after playing it a couple days, I found I enjoyed it more than I initially thought. Also, I get a much much better distorted sound by turning the master up to like 8+ and leaving the volume on about 2 for bedroom level playing. I first pegged the volume and played with the master on about 1 or 2 but it sounds so much better the other way around. The half power switch (pentode/diode) and fx loop are my favorite features. Although, the loop was more of a requirement in my search for a new amp. I hope this helps anyone looking to buy a great amp. I bought this at 329 last week, it says it's 399 now. Would I still pay that much for this amp and is it worth it? Yes, most definitely. Common question: can it handle gigs? Ive played in a band for many years as a teenager and young adult and understand  what it takes as far as volume and having enough headroom to sound decent. It will absolutely keep up with any drummer and handle small venues such as clubs or auditoriums. If you're playing somewhere bigger then they should have a pa and you'll have no issues if you can mic it up, obviously.

Pros:

2. It's especially not that visible from the front
3. It appears to be more robust than the Snark style where the clip breaks off after a while

Cons:
1. I find the display to be harder to read, both in terms of size and design, it's definitely not intuitive what to do compared to a Snark type.  It's useable but expect to stare at it a bit and experiment and see if it gets better or worse.
2. Looking at the directions and comments it's clearly not intended to be left on.",2

It just comes off so easily long after you've applied it so you will occasionally find it on your hands or on your clothes. I felt bad about buying a $5 pen. But honestly, the thing does the job it's supposed to do very well.

I've used it on all my guitar pedals and my amplifier. Even if you're thinking that you change your settings often or goof around with them there's no reason not to just put in reasonable parameters. I often make two dots for the low and high extremes on the knobs. That way I know that something between those two dots is perfectly reasonable. If I go past those two dots it's going to make a sound I already know I don't like.

9680,"This may only be helpful for a few of you:

I can't comment too much on how the Profire2626 performs as an interface, other than the fact that I noticed no problems the handful of times I have used it to open Pro Tools sessions. What I CAN say is that it is rock-solid when used as a standalone audio routing unit.

When used in standalone mode, connected to my main interface with 2 optical cables, my Profire 2626 offers:
-Eight microphone preamps that sound great for the money
-Two instrument DI inputs
-Eight channel AD/DA converter (TRS, ADAT)
-Two headphone amps, each outputting their own separate ""mix"" from the digital input
-S/PDIF converter (optical to coax, coax to optical)

I use it for the extra analog outputs and headphone amps, which I use to give each studio musician their own headphone mix. I also use it when my eight go-to microphone preamps aren't enough for the session and I need a few extra. Compared to other similar standalone preamp/AD/DA units (Digimax FS, OctoPre Dynamic, etc.), this one packs a few more features for the money, though I have not directly compared these preamps to those on the other units mentioned. Also, commenting on other reviews, I wouldn't write M-Audio off all together. While I can't comment in depth on their audio drivers, I own and regularly use their microphones and preamps, all of which have given me ""bang for the buck,"" as they say :)

While the preamps and converters may not be quite as audiophile-approved as other preamps and converters I own, It's great for what it does and I have no complaints. Again, I am not using this unit as an audio interface, but in standalone mode. This ""swiss army"" box has filled in the gaps in my gear nicely when I need a few extra channels of I/O or need to convert a S/PDIF signal.",2

9713,"I bought these upon recommendation of a friend.  They replaced the original D'Addario J74 strings that came with my mandolin.  I find the mediums a bit hard on my fingers so I chose lights, and am very happy with them.  They have a very nice sound and brightness and because they are light, are so easy to play.  I highly recommend these!",2
9714,"Worked fine. Just the weight I was after. Not much else to say, since they are just hunks of plastic.",2
9715,excellent,2
9716,"I know a lot of fuzz aficionados drool over the Big Muff's scooped tones.  I'm not one of those people, though, as I figure (a) the G and the D strings exist for a reason, (b) you're burying yourself in the mix by cutting out your mid-range frequencies, and (c) boosting the bass and the treble is a sure way to produce a tone that is both muddy and ear-splitting.

Well, guess what?  The Bass Big Muff is the perfect fuzz solution to all of the objections I've posted.  You get a much fuller range of frequencies than on the standard NYC Big Muff Pi, and the sustain is significantly smoother.

I only play guitar, and I rely on the Bass Big Muff for the following:

-Bluesy Sabbath-style minor-key dirge riffs
-Powerful, yet controlled, open chords
-Metal power chord progressions

My favorite setting so far is with volume at 12 o'clock, tone at 3 o'clock, sustain at 12 o'clock, and the toggle switch set to ""bass boost.""  You get a very solid sound, as if there's also a bass player cementing your root notes from an octave below.

This is by far my favorite distortion pedal for guitar.

EDIT: For clarity's sake - no octave effect.  The bass boost just gives you a clear, solid low end.",2
9717,"If you are looking to tinker around with a Kalimba, get this one. It's cheap, possible to tune, and looks pretty good. I leave it under the coffee table and pick it up during commercials, it's a good break from guitar and piano. I re-tuned mine into E (I think) and anyone can play it and sound good.",2
9718,"Great alternative vs the modern conventional strings (bronze).  I've used phosphor bronze (preferred, 20 years) with an occasional 80/20 bronze thrown in.  I really was hoping the Monel's would project more bass response.  They do not, they kind of reduce the thump actually (more lower range response with age), bronze alloys definitely have more bottom range.  The Monels tend to round out the guitar a little better.  They give more ""old school"" country jangle and allow for more ""overtones"".  As far as generating ""woody"" sound, I definitely hear it.  When I first put them on, I thought of grandma's old piano with what i'm guessing had Monel strings as it didn't have new strings since the '70's.  I don't know about the ""smooth"" description, I would say the give it more a mid range bump & jangle.  I put them on a straight braced Standard D-28 and they took a few days to break in.  I generally liked them the first day, and better as they aged.  It's been 2.5 weeks and I intend to replace with some of my on stock phosphor bronze to see the difference again after break-in and use, but all ready intend to start using the Tony Rice/ Monel with regularity in the future.  Absolutely worth a try or occasional experiment.  You definitely need to give them a few weeks to break in and give that used string kind of tone.",2
9719,"Got these for a suitcase drum kit I've been building, they were just what I needed to lower volume but still be able to have dynamics in my playing. highly Recommend",2
9720,"It's amazing how well this little guy works. The tone and clarity is nice and consistent at all volumes and the FLY 3 can get surprisingly loud. It isn't just for any one sound either. You could use this for Rock, Country, Jazz, Metal etc etc. If you can handle it the FLY 3 can too. Blackstar nailed it with this product.",2
9721,I am very impressed with this little mic. Of course Sennheiser is a great brand name but for $200 I honestly wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly proven wrong with the windmuff added it takes great audio outdoors and indoors the sound quality is as good as many of the pro mikes I've used in the past that cost a helluva lot more money. I use 2 Cannon 70D cameras to shoot interviews and monologues and I am very impressed with the sound quality I'm getting with this mic. So impressed that I'm going to buy a second so.,2
9722,This device is a converter that works with RCA inputs and outputs.  The Input seems to be geared for the -10DB range for consumer level audio range.  This box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones.,2
9723,Good value,2
9724,"works in tandem with the yamaha mouthpiece.  nothing fancy about it, good yamaha quality.",2
9725,"For some reason this mixer's mic pre's aren't as punchy and clear as the 502's, but it has 4 mic pre's and 4 stereo inputs, so it covers a lot of inputs in a small, easy to travel package. So even though it doesn't sound as punchy or as clear as a 502, it's still very convenient and not bad at all.",2
9726,"MONEY WELL SPENT!  ,I bought 2 for my stereo amp setup.
I play thru 2 Bugera 55 watt infiniums.
The amps are very sturdy on the stands, but I intend to rig some kind of extension for the top rear tube. The top bar that supports the back of the amp is about 2 or 3"" too short on each side to reach all the way passed the open-back frame.. The tubes are hollow with plastic caps on the ends, so it shouldn't be too hard to fix with a little bit of extra tubing.
That said, it still performs well for my amps. The stand is very sturdy, You'd never be able to topple it over or bend it..
They've never slipped or wabbled. The weight of the amp seems to keep it anchored to the stand like sitting in a saddle.. .
Still, I'm gonna make that one modification for extra insurance.
Might incorporate some Velcro while I'm at it.",2
9727,Awesome pedal.  Really captures a dirty AC tone I wanted for certain live songs.  It's not very warm sounding so it definitely doesn't emulate the tube amp I'm running through it but works very well for my purposes.,2
9728,the best for my electric,2
9729,"There were a couple of reviews here saying the bags fit fusion sets tightly.  They seem to fit my fusion kit with STM mounts with no issues. Nicely made bags with strong zippers. The 14x5.5 snare bag fits my Mapex 14x6.5 with no issues.  Mapex has deep rims, so more like a 7. I like the fact that the bags fold down nicely, so they can be stashed when not in use. The whole set actually arrived in the 4"" thick box, so they really collapse nicely. Very nice all around for the price.",2
9730,"Good little stand, fits he lap steel perfectly!",2
9731,Good reference,2
9732,This is real bone. Took a while to file them down to lower the action and replace the plastic parts on a cheap guitar.  But it has improved the sound quality immensely. Well worth it!,2
9733,"I've had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos.  What the hell.  Anyway, this capo works well.  I've only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics, and it does a fine job.  Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off, but it does not affect the capo-abilities.  I'm sure there are better ones, but for me, this works well.",2
9734,It works,2
9735,great for the price,2
9736,"As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different. I love Fenders especially telecasters (I love the simplicity of two pickups, two knobs, and a p-up selector). I wanted something with P-90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late. You can get a lot more for your money these days.

I pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P-90 by Epi and have been really impressed. I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet, I can't really think of anything to change.

Pros - Simple, TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through, Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel. Sounds KILLER through my tube amps (Peavey Classic 30 and 50, Fender Blues Jr.), lightweight, stays in tune, cheap price (not afraid to take it out to a gig, not afraid to have it stolen, let my kids play it, etc.), comfortable neck profile.

Cons - Cheap tuners (but stay in tune), cheap electronics (wiring), some frets are long and sharp (my high E string gets caught under the 14th/15th fret - I haven't filed it yet), messy job at nut and fret board.

All in all, this is a great guitar for a great price. I still plan on modding it, but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections. My upgrades, if any, will be new pots, caps, wiring, nut, perhaps tuners. No need to replace these pickups. You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this. At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrument.

As a bit of a guitar snob (love my US Fenders) this guitar is getting a lot of action. I say this one just may be a keeper.",2
9737,This was a birthday present for my wife. She enjoys playing it. I think for the money this a nice introductory instrument. Perhaps a better bow may provide a better sound. She recommends using high quality rosin.,2
9738,"I have 03 Les Paul Special with a Bixby Vibrmate on it. With the stock bridge. So, anytime I used the vibrato, the guitar would go out of tune. And not just a little...a lot. So, my guitar guy worked on the nut which helped a bit. But, what did the trick was this roller bridge. It allows better stretch of the strings and they roll rather than get stuck on the saddles of the stock bridge. I didn't want to replace the black keystone, Grovers with locking tuners. So this solution works very well on this LP. Still goes out of tune a bit, but I mean just a bit by comparison to how bad it was prior to the addition of the roller bridge and the nut work. Very reasonable price too.",2
9739,"Canvas bag, very sturdy, two long strap handles and doubled short handles. I have four speaker stands in one right now and have had as many as six mic stands with boom arms in this bag. Gunna buy a couple more soon to replace two ultimate bags that lost their handles. Great buy.",2
9740,only issue I see is that the power supply has no off switch which is an easy get around. Also the power lead is a bit flimsy and I imagine over time it could break if you were heavy handed.,2
9741,"If the profile of the 90 degree plug was a little lower I'd give it five stars. As it is, it gets four.

It's a solid cord that does it's job. I haven't run it though any high powered mixers and recording gear so I can't speak to how any of the total or high end signal loss is (yes, there really is a difference between those high end cables and the rest, even if most people can't hear it). but for just plug and play?

9752,"A friend went through my account to buy a couple of these a year ago. I've used both. The results have been great. Although I think the HOG-20 might have been sufficient for our purposes, the HOG-30 has features that provide a nice icing on the cake.

My primary use for these units has been amping the Mississippi sax (blues harp). Most of the time the input has been a variety of low-impedance and high-impedance mikes such as the Behringer XM8500 and the Astatic JT-30. I've also tested the amp with a Takamine acoustic electric and a Fender Stratocaster. All have worked like a charm. There's been no need for preamping or impedance-matching. The Pignose takes everything I throw at it.

I've had no problems with the batteries over the past year. Maybe that will come, but right now each battery charge lasts up to a week depending on the use. Also, the 8-inch speaker, while a bit smallish for what bluesmen typically want, is still more than capable of producing a very full-throated and resonant tone with plenty of bass. The HOG-30 has a Funk Bass switch that accentuates this very nicely. I assume that this switch emulates tube amp overdrive effects by combining a midrange boost with overlays of even-order harmonics. Whatever the case, I can use the switch to get a ""fat"" sound that works very well for blues.

While the case is very solid and sturdy, the amp can still be carried by its top strap. If you need to tote it for any distance, though, best to get a small luggage carrier.

The controls themselves are very simple and straightforward. There are three tone controls plus gain and master volume controls. These last two are probably to control the output of the preamp and main amp circuits, respectively, but in practice either one has been sufficient to control the volume. Two controls seems somewhat superfluous.

There is a 1/4 inch jack on the rear that allows me to use the Pignose as a practice amp with my Audio-Technica cans. The Pignose performs very well in this role.  And all in all, this is a terrific amp for practice, jamming, and performances in everything up to medium-large venues (up to 300 people). Should work great outside as well although I haven't tried this. The case is moderately weather-proof.

And, of course, the Pignose logo and pigskin exterior give the amp an undeniable charm all its own.",2
9753,"I've been using these two pickups in an Epiphone Les Paul for over five years, with a handful of tube based amps,  as well as a few modeling setups.  Sounds great in all of them but shines the most through an moderately overdriven tube amp.

I'm of the impression that these are the best non-boutique P.A.F. reproductions around.  Wooden spacers, alnico magnets, you name it, Seymour Duncan went to great lengths to model these pickups on the late 1950s Gibson 'Patent Applied for' (PAF) Pickups.

Frankly, the 59-neck pickup is legendary, and I will be looking to add humbucker  and single coil sized versions of it to my other guitars. There is no replacing it, as far as I am concerned it is the definitive neck pickup for rock and metal ( I know Dimebag Darrel and several members of Iron Maiden used it in the neck position). The neck sound is woody, warm, never muddy, and has a slight hint of bite behind it, especially with the guitar's volume pot dimed (maxed).  Almost a magical sound that has to be heard.

The Bridge 59 is bright and has a biting edge, resulting probably from vintage correct slightly mismatched coils.  It is slightly hotter than the neck pickup (probably by about .75 - 1.25 k. Ohms).  It gives a great, bright Pagey tone with guitar's volume knob dimed; backed off from between 7 to 9, the bridge 59 model still has a PAF'ey edge, but without the sharpness and brightness.  Great for blues, hard rock and even metal (more Dave Mustaine style metal though... I seem to be getting great Sabbath sounds from it as well, and the amps I have have tons of gain to spare).  It reminds me of a Duncan JB with less output.  It can be a bit abrasive, but this is what makes it great with distortion, in my opinion, and is easily toned down my using volume or even tone controls.

With the two pickups combined, (neck volume control set to 5-7, bridge set to 8-9.5, using 1950s Les Paul wiring rather than modern wiring), I get a balance of the two pickups - retaining the woodyness of neck pickup, with a brighter tone.  This in my opinion is perfect for edge of distortion tones, and my favorite use of the pickup - through a good Marshall I can get great dynamics and can go from say edge of distortion cleans (like Page's live version of Stairway to heaven) to overdriven leads by flicking the selector switch to the bridge position. Flicking to the neck pickup gets me almost or totally clean sounds, depending on the amp or pedal setting.",2
9754,"I checked the internal connection as it has been reported these are not set for proper XLR configuration, but the Mic itself is, for real use, the supplied cable is useless (XLR to 1/4""), but works fine with a proper XLR/XLR cable, have not A/B with a real SM58, but other reviews on YouTube show it is slightly hotter and slightly better on the higher frequencies.

9767,"I had a few audio projects coming up and I didn't want to rely just on my built-in laptop microphone. But I am not an audio engineer and didn't want to have to buy racks of equipment just so I could record high-quality audio. I also wanted my setup to be portable and durable.

So after shopping around I decided on the Rode Podcaster USB Microphone.

This is a hefty microphone -- very solid design. Also, using it couldn't be easier. Just plug it into my laptop's USB port (Mac) and start recording -- no need for external power supplies or other interface gadgets.

On a Mac, just plug in the mic, fire up Garage Band, and start recording.

I've already mentioned the heft of the microphone -- this means that you will likely need a solid mic stand to support the mic, especially since it connects to the stand at the base of the mic, and so the result makes the stand and mic a little top-heavy.

But I am very happy with this mic -- easy to use, durable, and makes high-quality recordings.

9772,"I upgraded the bass and tom tom heads on my Pearl Rhythm Traveler kit (ASIN: B0002FO4R8) to these heads with amazing results. Before upgrading the open bottom toms had a lot of ring and were impossible to get the tone I wanted no matter how carefully I tuned them. I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice ""thump"" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.

In addition to this head I upgraded to the 10"" (ASIN: B0002E1FQW) on my other mounted tom and the 14"" (ASIN: B0002D0DSO) on my floor tom.  The results were so dramatic that I also upgraded the batter side head on my bass drum with the 20"" bass drum head (ASIN: B0002D0E3S).

In addition to achieving the exact sound I wanted I also get far better stick response, and have found that tuning these heads are far easier than any other head I've used, including Remo that I use on my Ludwig kit.

These heads have transformed a relatively inexpensive drum kit into a professional quality kit that is incomparable in sound and performance.",2

Yes, the slow down feature sounds like a bad cell phone call, but it works. It wasn't that long ago that all you had was records, which you had to factor in the pitch change if you wanted to slow it down. So anything is an improvement over that.

The bad part comes from how they configured the firmware. Like most music gear, some nerdy Engineers ruined it with a bunch of nonsensical programing. Insanely enough, there is no EQ. Instead of just giving you Treble, Mid, Bass and Gain... They got the brilliant idea to add all these other things like ""cab"", ""amp"", ""enhancement"" and a bunch of other worthless controls. Getting a good tone is very difficult. Then once you do... even more insane is the fact that you can't change the sound patch, or all your tweqs are lost. Yes... They left no way to actually store patches. When you switch to another patch, all your settings are lost. But if you don't switch, they will still be there when you turn it back on.

9811,"Bought this for use with a Roland AC-33 acoustic guitar amp. Works very well at controlling the looper built in to the AC-33. Requires a stereo TRS cable -- use a right angle cable, makes the connections on both ends a little easier to manage. Plugs into the ""Looper"" 1/4 jack on the AC-33 and both switches on the FS-5 operate the Loop start, stop and clear functions. Only downside and reason I take one star off is no power switch or 9V DC jack. Should at least have a power switch since this switch requires 9V DC power and leaving it on (by leaving the cable plugged in) will drain expensive 9V batteries. I fixed this on the FS-6 I received by installing a simple push on/off button switch on the lower right corner of the FS-6, in series with the positive wire on the battery. Works great, out of way of the ""B"" switch (so I don't turn it off accidentally)  and I can tap the FS-6 on/off with my foot. Required 2 hours with a drill, dremel, soldering iron and hot glue gun. BOSS should do this for us, raise the price a couple bucks and make everybody happy.

I run it all into a Fender Deville 410, which additionally runs into an Acoustic B115 Neo bass cab for extra mmmph.

At first I thought it was the noise suppressor.  But even when it's off, I'm getting absolutely no buzz from my effects.

For the price this is AMAZING.  To be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend.  The cables are VERY long, maybe too long, if that's possible.  If you're even thinking about buying this, JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!!!",2
9813,good Product.,2
9814,"5 stars because I doubt you can do better at this price point.

Looks:  nice, neat, and I was impressed.  It is all laminate, i.e. plywood, but even the 300 dollar martin has laminate sides and back.  The Fender has a lam top also.  It was not worth spending another 200 bucks just for a solid wood top.  The top of he Fender almost looks like a picture of wood, but I think its a veneer.  The wood on the sides and back is beautiful.  The fretboard is simple, yet very handsome rose wood.  Lets not forget this is a travel guitar which may get knocked around.

Sound:  This guitar is loud.  It won't have the deep timbre of a fullsize, but don't think you are not waking up the house if you start jamming at 2 am. More expensive minis might have a better sound,  but for what I this for I'll keep my money.

Cons:  Nothing you would not expect from any out of the box acoustic.  I hated the strings it came with.  Easy fix. The action was slow: the strings were too high off the fretboard for my tastes.  Sanded the bridge down a little and now this is a guitar I love.  2 simple, typical common fixes,  and i am very pleased.

Conclusion: GREAT VALUE.  Value being the key word, with very little compromise.  If you want a solid wood top and maybe a warmer sound you'll need to spend another 200 bucks, but i doubt you will find a better 3/4 size guitar for the price",2

9821,"People have asked me why they should use D'Addario after most people have been using Ernie Ball for the longest time. I say to them, They last longer. I muscle the living hell out of my strings, and I can get probably a week and a half out of these strings. The 3rd string is very mellow sounding, but for my tastes that's the tone I'm looking for. The packaging that these strings come in is quite nice as well. The 11-49 gauge is quite chunky, but I knew what I was getting into, because I played Power Slinkys which were 11-48. In my opinion, this kind of thing is subjective, so you must try almost every combination at least once. Various gauges, various brands, various string models, various string materials, it's all subjective, so you must take your time and decide what's right for you. I've found it with D'Addario",2
9822,"Hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music. This small, acoustic Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 amplifier gives the musician/singer the needed outside feedback to get things sounding right.

No one hears themselves the way they sound to others. This simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music. This is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing, singing song writer. The Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job.

As the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars, I thought a lot for years about trying amplification. I probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life. Much to my delight, together with a passive, inexpensive hole-mounted pick-up (the Seymour Duncan SA3SC Woody) , an inexpensive Audio- Technica vocal microphone and this Behringer AT108, I can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even better!

At least as importantly, it allows me to hear myself more the way I am heard by others who will not hear me, as I do in part, from the resonations inside my skull.

One of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it. The mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom.

To hear what those listening hear, you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming TO you, not FROM you. That is where an amplifier comes in handy. It aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hear.
When we 'hear' ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback, we are 'hearing' a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads. The people who hear us, only hear us through their ears. The two experiences are not the same.
To discover how we really sound to others, we can go about it two ways. First, we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording, or we can put our practice through electronics - either through an external amplifier or through headphones, so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by others.
As an acoustic guitar player, I recently invested in a small, specifically acoustic amplifier, the Behringer Ultracoustic AT108, and have found the results to be simply astounding as I can now, for the first time, practice my songs until they sound the way I would like them to sound to others before recording them.
For a small amplifier that successfully replicates, electronically, the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier, this Behringer AT108 provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice, along with a three section equalizer, to provide the self-accompanying guitarist with the sound of what s/he really sound like to others. It can, initially, be a rather shocking experience!

Technically, this AT108 is at the low end of the famous Behringer line. Although the company is based in Germany, this box is built in China to their specifications. Solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping, it sports:
- 15 Watts of Power amp output,
- An 8"" dual-cone full-range loudspeaker with 4 Ohm impedance and a power
rating of 20 Watts,
- Inputs for an instrument (1/4"" TS mono connector,) a microphone ( Balanced
XLR) and for CDs (1/4"" TRS stereo connector,)
- A headphone output connector ( 1/4"" TRS stereo connector, and
- Three (Low, Mid and High Range) frequency controllers.
The unit measures approximately 13 X 14 X 7 inches, weighs just over 11 pounds and is easily portable. It comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plug-in cabling.

Finally, to answer a question I had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp, it does NOT make an acoustic guitar sound, in any way, like an electric guitar. The sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic. The natural tones are enhanced, not rendered tinny or 'electrified.'

It is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue. The 15 amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configuration.

At a current on line retail of somewhere between $75 - $95, an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing, practicing and listening is now open to me. The Behringer AT108 just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments I have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing, singing and recording.

UPDATE: 4 1/2 years later !

The amp I reviewed is used daily - and, when I have company, I use the second one I now have! Honestly, if I had room for a third one, I would get it - for jamming with small groups! The first one still performs perfectly and the second is a clone of the first.",2
9823,Good product. Fast shipping.,2
9824,"Ibanez's WD7 (Weeping Demon) is one of the most versatile wah pedals that you will ever stomp on.  Most wah pedals are one-trick ponies.  The weeping demon is the new master of wah pedals, and can make just about any wah sound that you'll need.  Your guitar will love you for this.

The casing looks awesome, and its built like a tank.  The exterior of the weeping demon is made almost entirely out of heavy duty die-cast metal (it looks sort of like sand-blasted aluminum).  I've owned mine for several years and there is barely a mark on it despite being stomped on incessantly when I practice.

Unlike most wah pedals, the power switch is not under the rocker, which I love.  With the switch to the right side of the pedal you have plenty of control, and you don't need to worry about either missing the button or over-doing it while you're rocking out.  This leaves the foot rocker free to swing.

On the left side of the pedal there is a lever.  When it is flipped towards the front of the pedal you are in standard mode where the rocker moves freely and the effect is controlled by the right-side switch.  When you flip the lever towards the back of the pedal it shifts the hardware into auto wah mode.  In auto wah mode the heel of the pedal instantly drops toward the base, and the pedal takes on a spring-loaded feel.  Rather than using the switch to activate the pedal you simply start using the pedal to automatically turn on the effect.  When you let the pedal drop back into place, it turns itself back off (with a delay if you desire).

The rocker has a wavy, rubber texture and feels good under the shoe.  To control the sound you have three knobs (level, Q, and low frequency) that allow you to adjust the character of the sound it makes and a small black switch that changes the pedal from guitar to bass mode.  A nice feature of the knobs on the weeping demon is that you can click them in and out of the body of the pedal after setting them to keep them from getting accidentally bumped while you play.  Additionally, there are two knobs under the foot rocker that allow you to further control the character of the sound and adjust the delay before the pedal turns off.

Unlike some wah pedals, this does not have negative impact on your sound.  More poorly designed wahs will add a bit of noise or hiss when the wah is powered on.  The weeping demon is completely silent when it is not in use.

The WD7 can be powered by an AC adaptor or battery.  It runs on a standard 9v DC power supply, so you can plug it up with the stock connectors of a pedalboard, use a spare adaptor from another pedal, or daisy-chain with a pedal that is capable of powering others (like the BOSS TU series).

The WD7 is the wah pedal to rule them all.",2
9825,"Even at maximum length it's a bit short (I'm not a slim man) so I'm playing a bit high on the chest. The slits on the holes of the leather ends are extremely stiff so it's difficult to get on and off, but no question are secure when on.",2

After years of playing many guitars with no falls, my Gibson V fell off of its strap pretty violently last month.  Fortunately it escaped with only a small dent in the finish, and I bought these strap ""locks"" right away to prevent it from happening again.  I haven't had any problems since, but I don't do anything crazy with my straps.

These definitely seem useful to prevent falls if you're treating your guitar normally, but they aren't tough enough to stand up to any crazy spins or stage tricks.  If that's what you're looking for, get some proper locks that screw into your guitar.",2

I don't think I will use the IMT500 again unless the Snark SN5 gets broken.",2
9836,"I have a 1999 or 2000 American p-bass and the old bridge was getting pretty rusty. I opted to try out the hi-mass bridge because why not? At worse it looks cool and clean, at best it boosts mids and other mumbo jumbo.

Install was even simpler than I thought- a lot of basses solder a ground to the bridge. At least my bass had the ground folded over to a spot where it'd always be connected to the bridge. If that's not your case, take 10 minutes and watch some youtube videos on soldering/desoldering and learn that soldering can be surprisingly easy if you use proper technique.

All that to say- this bridge literally just screwed in. Screws were even the same size. If you do happen to find your screws fitting loosely, evenly spread a layer of wood glue or super glue around the sides of the hole.

I then intonated the bridge and set string height (10 minutes more of youtubing for the uninitiated) and was off to the races.

Playing felt identical to usual- as it should on a properly set up bass.

I think I had expected too much out of the mid gains in the tone department- so temper your hopes. I play hard with a pick and with a good amount of grit through my head that can obfuscate subtle differences in tone, so i heard absolutely nothing noticeable.

4 stars for it being shiny and new and cool looking and having a super easy install. Lack of star for doing nada for tone.",2

It is unfair for me to rate it but I can tell you be sure you are not using it w/ a subwoofer and powered speakers which already do the job without it.

Who would want a delay pedal that inhibits growth? We don't want to live in the past or marry the moment; we do however want to live in the unobtrusive, mulched presence of the enriching past, informed but not tyrannized by its echoes. That is why we have chosen this lovely pedal.",2

9848,"I picked up the R0DE Podcaster a few days ago, and it sounds great -- much better than I expected. I honestly expected it to sound cheesier because it's USB instead of XLR. I made a couple of test recordings and gave them to my wife, who is always saying that I don't sound like myself in my recordings. She said that this is the best-sounding mic I've ever used, and that I sound just like myself. My background in audio is a couple of years in podcasting and some live interviews. Equipment I've used in the past includes the Audio Technica 4033a, Heil Pro PR-40, Symetrix 528e, Zoom H-4, and the M-Audio MobilePre.

Pros:

Sounds great.

Very competitive price when compared to decent XLR mics.

Direct to USB (computer sees it as a sound card).

Headphone jack built in for direct, live monitoring (huge plus), with volume control (which does not effect recording volume).

Allows remote recordings to a laptop (with all the nice software) without lugging around extra devices to convert a ""real"" mic to USB or Firewire.

Works automatically on a Mac.

Feels very solid and sturdy -- very well made.

Front-firing cardiod-pattern dynamic mic (helps reduce most ""background"" noise).

Completely USB-powered.

Cons:

Direct to USB: No possibility of using a hardware mixer or voice processor, and you can't use more than one at a time (except maybe with special software).

Large and heavy. Not really a big deal if you keep it on a mic stand like I do, but you need a real stand -- not a cheap one.

Doesn't come with any kind of padded box for storage/travel like pro mics. It's probably not meant for travel, but its functionality and all-in-one design certainly encourage it.

White plastic body and white USB cable. Sure, it matches my MacBook, but for some reason it feels a little weird that it's not silver or black. Personal taste, and I couldn't find much else to complain about.

All in all, it exceeds my current needs, and I'm selling my ""pro"" equipment to fund my other hobbies. I would recommend this to any podcaster who doesn't need multiple mics or a hardware mixer. If you just want to sound great on Skype, this'll do the trick, although it will probably be overkill.",2

I used to used 10-46 on LPs because they are also balanced but these  are easier to bend. Gibson used to use 10-46 on new guitars and now realized they need have an easier set to bend, so as of this writing, 2016 Les Paul Traditional would come with this same guage.",2

The actual keyboard is solidly built and has a quality feel to it. It came with some excellent software (downloaded from M-Audio's website) and it also some has some simple DAW/MIDI controls using the actual keys and an ""advanced"" button. It's pretty slick.

9860,"The battery compartment seems to lose its resilience fairly quickly which causes a lack of electrical contact resulting in the unit not staying on all the time.  I only had mine maybe a year before this started happening and I started to wrap a rubber band around the battery compartment door to maintain contact.  Since rubber bands only last so long, I switched to a velcro cable tie that works as well.  This whole issue is really only a problem when batteries die in the middle of a performance and you have to scramble to swap them out, only to have to fumble with a battery door secure strap as well.  Just another reminder to always change to fresh batteries before your set starts!

Other con:  on very rare occasion, I will get dropouts for seemingly no reason.  Usually switching channels fixes it.  The only thing I can attribute it to is some random RF interference in THAT area at THAT time.  Two friends who use the G30 model also have that same problem.

Besides all that, the sound is crystal clear.  I did several recordings after I bought the G50 comparing it to a Monster cable and also my old Sennheiser G2 wireless.  The Sennheiser was a workhorse but sounded like mud compared to a cable.  The G50 however was indiscernible from the cable except to an overly anal-retentive audiophile (those guys everyone hates because they claim to be able to tell the difference between brands of batteries in their boutique pedals because a 0.1V difference ""completely changes the sound"").  The sound is so clear that I actually record with it now so I have one less cable to trip over in the studio.

*** EDIT ***  I finally decided to take a soldering iron to the battery door contacts, putting a very small layer of solder on the contact points.  This fixed the issue I mentioned above an no longer have to wrap anything around the wireless pack.  I did the same thing to my friend's G30 that was having the same issue and his works great now too.",2

9865,"I bought this because I needed a small footprint Univibe type effect on a new board I was building. I also have an MJM 60's vibe, which is supposed to be an authentic Univibe circuit.

I can get pretty close to the MJM with The Depths. I found with the Voice knob all the way to the down and the Throb at noon, it was nearly identical, but with a bit more high end bite. Oddly, EQD recommendation for a ""classic vibe"" setting sounded NOTHING like the MJM. The Depths has a bit more hi-fi sound that can help cut through a mix, where the MJM has a more relaxed and mellow tone. The Depths can produce a much more intense effects using the various knobs, and has a lot more output volume. The Depths also does not have the ""vibe"" switch like a UniVibe. It is chorus only (does anyone really use a UniVibe in ""vibe"" mode?)

If you are looking for authentic UniVibe tone, I think the Depths can get pretty darn close. If you are looking for a more hi-fi, modern take on the UniVibe, with more intensity options, more control, and more output, then give this pedal is certainly a winner.",2

Pros:
has every power plug you would need for your pedals
multiple ways to wire effects
has a line tester (so you can tell right away which one is the problem)
Comfortable handle
Sturdy case (great for stacking with other pedal boards/equipment)
Extra space on top of the case for cables etc.

I never new about silk and steel string so I decided to give this a try when I saw it on Amazon.

I could say that feels softer on my hand and that it sounded better on my guitar. Of course this is because I prefer finger play as compare to strumming.

It basically looks similar to the steel string package with the string 6, 5, 4 and 3 have silk strands in between the steel string and the bronze cover.  String 2 and 1 is regular steel string.",2
9889,works great and makes it more playable.. and lasts forever.. I have had one of these for like 10 years,2
9890,a life saver..a 7.2 volt drill/screwdriver works well all the torque u need...no more changing heads for 30 mins...try 2 mins that fast or quiker...I use it at church its already noice nobody can hear it as I just change heads about reg drum key to do 10 times a long service....love it still use ur reg drum key to do your fine ending tuning..still super fast!,2
9891,Love this capo.  I use it mostly to help string my Bigsby mounted guitar...  it is well made and works great,2
9892,This capo is fantastic for the price. It holds the strings down tightly without any buzz. I find it a little finicky to move sometimes due to thequick change style release but it's still excellent.,2
9893,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled, the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very, very smooth to play and the sound is amazing, I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric, and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat, mellow, sweet sound.",2
9894,"This was my first guitar purchase and I think I got a good price. I am a bit occupied learning another instrument, but after having a musician friend of my actually play this guitar...he said it was pretty decent. One thing he told me right away was that the guitar tuner that comes bundled with this package (Eno ET-33) isn't very good. After we experimented with it and a Snark guitar tuner...it was pretty clear that there are better ones out there, so I ended up purchasing a Snark tuner (SN5X) as a separate purchase. Overall, I am excited to learn to play!",2
9895,"Great nut for my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, fitted with a Stetsbar pro 2 tremolo system. Sanded down the bottom of the nut for action purposes, and it works like a charm. Well except for the typical g string hang up on les paul's.",2
9896,A Good strap for the money.,2
9897,Fits the two seemingly opposite criteria for a good capo: fairly easy to open and reposition yet stays quite securely in place once you have it where you want it.  I chose the black because it almost disappears against a dark fretboard  -- which means it also shouldn't reflect light or draw attention to itself in video shots.,2
9898,"This fit my Gibson SG perfectly!  My old switch needed replacement.  This the exact replacement fo my guitar, I'm very happy.",2
9899,"I bought this because of it's low price and seemingly higher end features(rosewood fingerboard instead of painted, nickel silver frets instead of cheaper brass, etc.), and it seems it was worth it. I like the looks, the paint was applied very well with little over spray, not expected for the price. The sound is at least as good as my over $50.00 Mahalo, and it holds tune just as well to boot. A worthy investment if just starting out, and it's perfect for kids.

In closing, this is the best low cost, beginner uke on Amazon. It sounds great, is well made, and has so much character with it's painted body that it looks to be worth twice what you paid for it. If your on the fence, jump on over to this side and enjoy a great uke at a bargain price!",2

9901,"Light but Powerfull amplified speakers for use at parties, small concert halls and many other application.  I liked it. Behringer has very good products. Reommended",2
9902,"I love this thing and for the price you just can't beat it. It seems sturdy and I have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up. I haven't tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my 7 electric guitars very nicely. Set up only took about 10 min or so and it included all the tools necessary. I saw the same one in guitar center a week later for $60 more. Like I said, for the price you can't beat it.",2

9904,"Daughter is a beginner drummer.  She owns a very cheap starter set that didn't have a ride cymbal.  This one sounds more like what one would expect a cymbal to sound like, compared to the clang of the cheap crash cymbal that came with her set.

Daughter is very happy with this.",2
9905,One of those products I like so much that I fear giving up the secret in a review. It's a warm phase effect. I love the sound of it and think it's a steal for around $60.,2
9906,I love these guys. There's no added distortion from the chords or any chord I have that Pyle makes. Keep doing you pyle.,2
9907,"Great for tiltback amp stands with integrated boom holder.  Can tilt the amp back far and shove the mic'd amp close to a wall if needed.  Locking mechanism helps avoid sagging boom touching the amp, too.",2
9908,"These strings are great. I haven't tried every label and make out there, but these are strings I can trust without a doubt. Wonderful resonance, and completely worth it over $20 brands like Red Label.",2
9909,"My wife uses this stand.  This is a great stand.  I have a hamilton.  Only real difference is the name stamped into them.  They are both solid products.  We have a wood floor in our studio, so we have the little vinyl feet on them, which I would recommend.",2
9910,Love the rich sound from this amp.  It makes my Bass Ukulele sound great.  It is hands down the best Bass Amp for around $100 bucks.  It is also  a bit bigger.  I was looking at the Eden Ec-8 and Fender but they did not have the heft of this Amp.  The eden is about 1/3 the size and I was tempted on size alone but the Ampeg beats it on sound,2
9911,"Seems to work well, though I don't know how long it's supposed to last. I have sweaty hands, and when I'm done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy.",2
9912,"Great machine that will keep your family entertained for hours.  The mics are great, and the speaker on this machine is pretty loud.  It has connections to hook up to your TV in case the 7-inch screen isn't big enough for y'all.  The only negative remark I have (which is minute) is that the CD's that come along with the machine have terrible songs.  I highly recommend you buy other karaoke CD's that are available on Amazon.  I bought the 60's, 80's, and Rock hits.",2
9913,"Very reliable, inexpensive strings. Ordered these for years for my Strat copy. The 3-pack is a good value but I'll spring for the 10-pack next time.",2
9914,"I bought this for my nine-year-old daughter to use as a cello stool. It sits about 13 inches if you take the bolt out completely and have the seat all the way down, which works okay but means you have to pick it up by the base to move it. The stool is solid and the seat portion is comfortable. I wish there were a way to secure the seat at such a low setting, but I wasn't able to find a low-cost option that would do this so I am happy to have this.",2
9915,Good for doing YouTube videos. This does not cost much but sounded really good. If  you are on a budget this is a good choice. It does need a power source so be sure it is compatible with your device before you purchase.,2
9916,Works great with my Windows 10 machine. Super easy instructions to go to the website and download/install the drivers and off you go. The knobs feel very quality and it seems really well made. Glad to have a decent audio interface again.,2
9917,"I have this pick up along with a 496R in a Les Paul Studio Lite.  It took me awhile to warm up to them.  Most of my guitars have '57 classic type feel to them.  But with those guitars I usually added a clean boost pedal to get the sort of attack I wanted for aggressive blues and classic rock.  I eventually realized that this pick up sounded just how I wanted it to without adding a 10db boost.

It is an aggressive pick up for sure, but I would not call this a metal pick up the way other reviews do.  I say this mainly because the output is clean and bright.  It does not default to a distortion sound but it certainly can.  On my Blackstar combo, I only need the gain on 2 to get decent crunch.  If I need a mellow clean, I can roll down the volume to 5 for a more PAF sound, or, leave it full up and select the both the 496R and the 500T.  This takes out some of the bite and is still clear and bright sounding.  It is bright enough that it takes away some of the inherent muddiness of a humbucker in the neck position when both pick ups are selected.  The 500T alone has the bite of my P90s with a bit more fullness.

My plan is to do a split coil thing for more variety in the sound.  I am quite happy with this pickup.",2
9918,Works well.,2
9919,well made. Tascam quality. great price.,2
9920,Great cables,2
9921,It does what the reviews says ! I Love it!,2
9922,I needed some pickup rings for my Les Paul as the plastic had dried out over time & cracked.  These pickup rings fit like a dream & I had them installed in less than 30 minutes..  I've been a Gibson fan for over 20 years & love everything they produce.  Thanks again Gibson.  You have a customer for life !,2
9923,"Outstanding! You may have to do some filing down depending on your guitar. Fortunately for me, not the case. A darn good deal, and a darn good price. I have good sound again.",2
9924,"Genuine Fender, 3 ply, retail packaging.  It was exactly what it was supposed to be.  Fit my MIM without an modification.",2
9925,Good quality.,2
9926,I have a few synth rack module where I need to merge clock from my drum machine and notes from my keyboard. This works perfectly. Only downside is that some newer Midi gear does not put out the standard 5V and will not power this device. All my older synths work fine though.,2
9927,Gorgeous strap that's very comfortable. I've used it on a few different guitars and it works great so far - from a Strat to Sheraton Epi to Ibanez Artcore to Jackson Soloist to Les Paul Studio. I installed Schaller (14010101) strap locks to it and it works smooth transferring on multiple guitars.,2
9928,Awesome product!,2
9929,"took a while to get these installed, but took my time to keep them all lined up.. def helpfull for me a new piano student",2
9930,"Excellent quality XLR cables!!! I've got several of these laying around, and all are well made.",2

9932,"Sweet little amp, good tone.",2
9933,Fast shipping. Item as described. Great quality product.,2
9934,Great but the ROCKVILLE unit is the same device and only costs $100!,2
9935,"This microphone's quality is amazing. I just hooked it up to my PC (Windows 7) and it worked no hassle whatsoever. Nothing to install or hoops to jump through, just works great. I recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises. The stand that comes with it is very stable, but it is low to the ground (or in this case, desk/table) so it may pick up some unwanted background noise (computer fans, mouse clicks/movement, etc).",2
9936,"Great deal! Don't waste your hard-earned money on ""name brand"" pick guards that are identical and overpriced.",2
9937,Been using it for almost a year & still works great!!,2
9938,Generally once you get these on they hold the strap nicely.  I at times struggle both getting them on and off.  This is worse if you are doing it in a hurry as the rest of the band has already started :-(  Get them in place before and they are great.,2
9939,This is the 2nd one I purchased need I say more?,2
9940,Great tuner pedal and great price. I wanted a pedal tuner that was easy to read and this it's perfect.,2
9941,This pedal works just as well as the ones costing 2-3 times the price. Love it.,2
9942,Love joyo pedals.  Not sure yet on the new line.  They just don't feel as solid to me. That being said the pedal sounds great. great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch. time will tell,2
9943,Great for big guys.,2
9944,I use these in conjunction with a 74 gauge for a Jackson 7 string.  Singing leads and articulated beefy riffs.  Although like most guitar strings they don't last very long slap these on before a show and get ready for the tonez!,2
9945,"I love this slide, it is lightweight and sounds great on the strings. I like that it is a bottle type which makes it easier for control. I have med/large hands and slide fits on ring or little finger comfortably.",2
9946,Very satisfied. Very well made and  very heavy.,2
9947,Great,2
9948,"Its solid. Has great quality. & doesn't short out on you. I had it for a few months now & not a tear anywhere in site Planet Waves printed on the cord ""guaranteed for life"" i think they mean it XD",2
9949,"Very cool product. I enjoy tuning my guitar with this than with my tuner. Very simple yet very precise. You can carry these around easily and effortlessly. I tried this with pianos and the resonance was beautiful. If you have other musical instruments just try to use this fork on all of them, it is going to be fun. I like it very much!",2
9950,These are the best strings money can buy. They won't tear your fingers up if you work the neck and they last 4 times as long. A real no-brainer. Plus the tone is AMAZING.,2
9951,GOOD SOUND !!!!,2
9952,"Easy to install. Easy to tune. Bought for my son, who tries to learn guitar and he likes it. They were recommended for a beginner.",2
9953,Did not come with the necessary part to connect the t-bar to the stand itself. May need to go to hardware store to get a bolt or something. Otherwise seems like a good stand.,2
9954,Well padded and sturdy.  Shipped fast.  It is adjustable but not quite enough for small children (9).  Works though.,2
9955,"Not bad. The effects are decent. The only thing I would change is to add a blend control. I like a long reverb tail but only a slight to moderate presence in the mix. On this the effects are all wet. To compensate for this, and to use it with things other than an acoustic guitar, I mounted this preamp in a plastic box. I have a 1/4 inch jack connected to a 2.5 mm plug which goes to the preamp. This basically turns this into something resembling a guitar effects pedal without the footswitch. This can either be patched into an effects loop or placed directly in the signal chain between your instrument and amp or mixer. I have an acoustic guitar amp with a vocal input that sounds horrid. I plugged a mic into this preamp and then to the mic input on the amp and it sounds a lot better after tweaking the EQ and adding just a little of the wide effect. The only problem I've had so far is there is a slight pulsing noise and I think it may have something to do with the pots that control the effects.

<<<Update>>>
The pulsing noise seems to have gone away. I've been so impress with this that I bought another and mounted them both both in a plastic project box. One for a wireless headworn mic and one for guitar. Great way to travel light and enhance the sound.",2
9956,"This Mic is great ,, love it ,love the price ,,, shipped in two days ,,sounds good, all around good deal",2
9957,"Wow.  This thing must go to 11, as it gets really LOUD for such a small amplifier.

The good:
Volume/gain control
built in effects (echo/reverb) & Tremolo/phaser
Mic input
Aux input
Comes with external power adaptor or uses batteries
Easy to use

The Bad:
Really, ""C"" batteries?  Nobody uses ""C"" batteries anymore. (ok, I'm being nitpicky)
Reverb/echo does not work when you first turn it on, until you wiggle the knob.

Honestly, I love this thing.  It works really well on my Piezo pickup guitar, and even better on my electric.  There are multiple volume controls to mix your microphone input, guitar input and aux input.  It works well as a portable speaker for your smart phone/mp3 player.  I compare this to my crummy 15W Crate amp.

There may be better out there, but I am happy!",2
9958,nice warm sounding pickups  good clean tone not for Metal,2
9959,Work well and unobtrusive. I leave in on the guitar in the case and when I play so it's always there when I need it.,2
9960,"These are my go-to for acoustic. Nice and bright, and they last a long time!",2
9961,"I enjoyed putting this Tube Drive together. The battery does not last long so be sure to get the proper 9 volt power supply to fuel this baby. Had no problem putting this together, just set myself up at the workbench and went to it. Took me a half an hour to read over the instructions and approx. an hour to put everything together. I also did the Piledriver which was much easier. Had them for 2 years now and still going strong.  Overall I would recommend it if you like a little challenge building stomp pedals.",2
9962,Nice little practice amp; perfect for beginners or someone like me that wants a spare and doesn't have to worry about babying it because it was so inexpensive,2
9963,Awsome sound with outstanding playability.  I did not know that quality strings could make such a difference in how a guitar sounds.,2
9964,One good tough case for the road.  One of the best of the bunch of this new style of case!,2
9965,"This is a nice microphone for under $80. The MXL 770 is a Cardioid condenser mic that needs phantom power. The frequency response is 30hz to 20kHz and has an impedance of 150 ohms. The mic has a switch for bass cut and -10db. It comes with a shock mount and carrying case. MXL makes great microphones for many different uses. I like the 770 for acoustic guitars, vocals and drum overheads. It's also great for other instruments and broadcasting too. To me the mic sounds warm and dark before adding anything, of course everybody's ear is different so that's subjective. The MXL 770 works great when used with my other mics that are priced higher then it. The 770 blends well or works nice solo. Not a bad microphone to add for under $80 and not the best either. If something happens to it, it's easier to replace then some of the others.",2
9966,"I got three of these to go from guitar to pedalboard and pedalboard to 2 amps in a stereo rig. They are made well, very solid, and seem to have very little signal loss for 20 foot cables.",2
9967,Good quality and price. Have yet to have a problem with it.,2
9968,Just awesome and very nice,2
9969,"this gauge is excellent especially for the money. some have said it's not accurate; yes, for some scales I measured it off by one or two tenths of a millimeter... this is not big deal as guitar setup is about how it feels to the player and the consistency and reproducibility of that setting. this will provide that no problem and at a full delivered price that is less than just the shipping from the big luthier supply house.  it was so good I ordered an extra just in case. some also said it comes w sharp edges which it does from the stamp cutting operation. two minutes with a fine flat file fixed that.",2
9970,Cute little novelty amp for fun and practice,2

9973,"My friend was using a small Casio and I just felt compelled to bless him with this 61 key Hamzer.
He began to play and I was reminded of a story about an old man who had lost his Straevareous and he looked everywhere when it was found the person who found it said it was his and the old man said, ""Wait play it."" After the fool finished, the old man said she's mine and asked to play it. The old man caressed the violin and kissed it like he was kissing his lover. As the violin stirred it grabbed everyone by the heart.  I was blown away when my friend with that same kind of passion shared his gift with us.  I was blessed.",2
9974,"Very durable and comfortable, I bought a few.",2
9975,Good,2
9976,My favorites.,2
9977,"This is an outstanding tuner, with a degree of accuracy which would challenge the most trained ear. For some instruments, getting it to lock down to a tenth of a cent is hard. My bass's E string moves off the pitch, if you hit it hard, or pluck it, so that note was rough tuning to the strobe's level of accuracy. Also, if you're tuning a newly strung guitar, using the strobe setting is difficult. Thankfully, the Crescendo ZenStrobe Tuner allows you to tune with the normal 1% accuracy found in other tuners, called the Meter Mode. So you can rough tune in meter mode, then switch over to strobe mode, to fine tune your top strings. My buddy plays second cello in the local symphony. He normally uses a tuning fork, or of course listens for the piano, or oboe, at the symphony. However, he wears a hearing aid now, so hearing the right note is difficult. I know he worries about hearing the tuning pitch, thru the cacophony of other instruments tuning. Since he gets to play solos, his tuning needs to be spot on. So, a vibration strobe tuner like this, is perfect for him.  The other instruments won't affect the tuning. With the variety of key settings, C, Bb, Eb, F, or just chromatic, he can hit his string, and fine tune.  Another feature he liked, was that you could change the A440 setting. (He plays baroque music sometimes, with a guy who likes to use the older tuning.) I tried finding the pitches on my Tibetan Singing bowls, as a challenge to the tuner.  Even with all the overtones those things have, the tuner was sensitive enough to distinguish the bowl's fundamental tonic pitch. A sharper tap on the bowls would produce the subdominant. (I always assumed the secondary note the bowls made was the dominant. Go figure.) My experience confirmed this tuner was very versatile, extremely accurate, and easy to use.
FUNCTION
Easy Breezy. There are only three buttons. One turns it on, the second button allows you to switch between Strobe mode (0.1% accuracy) and Meter Mode (1% accuracy, ie, close enough for rock and roll). The third button changes the pitch setting. You clip on the tuner to your instrument. (On the neck, sound hole, doesn't matter so long as it vibrates.) Now, pluck that string. If you're sharp, the indicator lights will spin counterclockwise around the note indicator, if you're flat, the lights spins clockwise. It's designed to calibrate your pitch with the precision of a scientific instrument, but without the need of a scientist to figure it out how it works. In other words, it's easy learning curve.
DO I NEED A STROBE TUNER?
How important is accuracy of pitch to you? How accurately does your instrument tune? Seriously, if you have a cheap guitar, with loose tuning pegs, or the intonation is messed up on the upper frets, then you probably don't really need a tuner with this much accuracy. However, if you spent a lot of money on a precision made guitar, or you play an instrument produced by a master craftsman in a symphony, and your ears notice the slightest change in intonation and pitch, then why not buy the better tuner? It's not that much more money, considering its ten times more accurate than a regular meter tuner.  If you find your instrument is difficult to tune to the strobe's degree of precision, then switch it over to the meter tuning. You'll have that option.

I was provided a free tuner in exchange for a fair and honest review.",2

10000,"...that's as in ""Just Right"".  This stand is plenty sturdy enough to support my 22"" Zildjian ride, but is deceptively light in weight. There are a number of very intelligent touches here. The fact that the boom slips into the vertical shaft for storage makes for a very slim profile in my hardware bag. The hinged height adjustment collars are ingenious and should prevent the binding that typically occurs with these parts over time. The legs extend to a wide footprint but are unobtrusive enough to allow for tight placement among other stands. The various tilter adjustments and boom length allow for an almost unlimited range of height, length and angle adjustment. I went from a very heavy Tama stand to a too-light Axis to this one. Not too heavy, not too light, just right!",2
10001,"Just perfect. Every guitar player needs one of this, even if you don't do your setups yourself, at least you can know for the fact if your guitar action is too low, or too high.

Mixing the two piezo crystals makes a dramatic difference in percieved audio quality as the vertical and horizontal axis assist in taking the edge off of each other. I recommend any electric violinist to experiment with multi pickup arrangements and use this behringer to amplify certain parts to see how the mix affects overall tonal quality.",2

10025,"I purchased this pickup for an Epiphone DR-212 12 string guitar and, I am very pleased with the looks,performance and the price of this item. I certainly cannot give this pickup a bad review because it works perfectly for me,I wasn't certain how it would do with a 12 string guitar because there's a lot more involved in a 12 than a 6 string instrument. Maybe the folks that dinged it didn't try it in an acoustic amp, believe me there is a world of difference between an amp made for a solid body electric and an acoustic electric guitar. I use a Fishman Loudbox Artist amp and my 12 string equipped with this Seymour Duncan Woody HC pickup sounds sweet. Very easy to install and remove if so desired. I didn't know if I would like the cord hanging down but, it's really no big deal. All I do is feed it straight down and back and run it between my guitar and strap and it stays completely out of the way. I do this also with all my solid body guitars, it helps to keep the cord out of the way and, it also acts like a strain relief just in case the cord gets pulled or stepped on. You can spend a whole lot more on a pickup for an acoustic guitar but, for the price of this one it does a pretty darned good job. I have several Seymour Duncan pickups in my other guitars and, I have no complaints with any of them. Seymour Duncan doesn't make inferior quality merchandise, that's one of the main reasons plus this unit having a decent price that I purchased it.",2
10026,"Bought this to have a clean bypass tuner at the front end of my chain and it works fantastic, allows extremely accurate and fast tuning.",2

10031,"You know, this thing REALLY does a fantastic job, and it's VERY easy to clean, but... Holy crap, the price. You can get similar longevity and performance out of a nine dollar pop filter made with cloth instead of metal. Jesus, just buy that please.",2
10032,"I bought this bench more than six months ago. At first, I thought it was a bit stiff. After a few weeks I either got used to the sturdiness of the cushion or I ""broke"" it in. This is a bench I think will last me several years. I've been using it several times a day, at least, a half hour at a time. I'm a hair over 5'3, fit and of average weight. I find this bench comfortable to sit on for extended periods of time. It supports good posture and keeps me at a good height as I play. One thing to note is that at beginning I thought it was too high for me, so I lowered it, but never felt it was quite right, until I realized that good posture is keeping my back straight, hands curved, wrist loose, forearm and elbow aligned to the the top of my keys, shoulders relaxed and feet flat on the ground. I was too low, so my elbows were dipping, my shoulders were tense, my wrists were stiff and hurting. It's an awkward feeling to get used to the stately manner that good posture forces us to have, but I got used to it and this bench was able to accommodate that. I say this because there are a few reviews commenting on the excessive height of the seat and I just want people to make sure that we have the right expectations of what a proper seat height is.

For the price, this bench can't be beat. There was little assembly required - nothing that needed a hammer or a screwdriver. It came in two pieces - the cushion and the legs - and I just snapped them together at the height I wanted. It's a long cushion with ample space. Sometimes, I've needed to store it, and all I have had to do was click the legs out from the cushion and fold. It's a very light piece of furniture. After several months of use, this seat still looks and works like new.

Edit: Just as this review went live, I noticed the price jumped from the $30 I bought it for in June 2013 to $44.95 without Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping. As a result, while I am not changing my rating or review, if I were to buy this bench again, I would be more inclined to purchase another bench of similar quality but cheaper price.",2
10033,"This is a much better case than expected. Inside is very plush and my Epiphone Les Paul 100 fits perfectly. Outside is very clean and looks like
it will protect quite well. Hardware hinges with a lock in one hinge are sturdy and sparkle with that chrome look. Very satisfied with this purchase.",2
10034,"I picked these up along with a number of other parts in order to breathe life back into my '72 Japanese Les Paul copy. I honestly decided on the pickups for their appearance alone, but was pleasantly surprised by by the quality. They provide clean rich warm tones perfect for blues and jazzy sounds in the neck position, and at the bridge they have a sharp bright attack well suited to hard rock and metal sounds. I will be purchasing these again in the future.",2
10035,"Expensive, but sounds great. So far it has been sturdy (our other Yamaha, but alto mouthpiece chipped within a week)",2
10036,"Well, it works. Once I figured out that leather loop with the OTHER hook on it wasn't actually part of the strap unless you wanted to use it to hang it on the wall. Took me a second to figure out, but it seems to work exactly like it's supposed to. Being only 5'3"" , I also have the advantage that I can actually adjust the strap enough for it to wear crossways across my body like a purse strap- (and I'm not skinny either).  My classical guitar is also fairly light, so this strap works exceptionally well to support the guitar enough that I can play standing up if I need to.  This guitar, though not a particularly expensive instrument, is my 'baby"", and I wasn't about to drill holes or even try to glue anything to it to add strap buttons for the few times I'd need a strap at all.",2
10037,"works well
a little expensive",2

10050,"Ernie Ball has done it again. These Cobalt Slinky's are by far the best I've ever found. I play a lot of Gilmore, Clapton music and bending is a must. They stay in tune on both My Strat and My Les Paul and last at least a week or two, and that's saying something. I like them over a D'Addiro's. I'm even started using them on My Martin. I highly suggest using these strings to anybody.....",2
10051,"Arrived quickly and was easy to assemble. Seems sturdy enough for it's purpose. Looks nice in the room, and I think it is as nice as the more expensive benches I viewed online and in the local music store.",2
10052,"I used these wires to completely wire two guitars and I still have enough to do another guitar! It gives the wiring job a nice clean look. The pre-tinned wires makes soldering easy and the cloth can be pulled back easily without any need to strip the wires. The only thing I found a bit of a pain was sometimes my pliers would manage to cut the wire but not the cloth, so I would have to finish the cut with a pair of scissors. Overall though I find it much easier to wire a guitar with these than with standard plastic coated wires. Shipping wasn't exactly the fastest, even with Prime, so I would order these wires first thing when you get the hunkering to do a guitar project.",2
10053,"Great uke, mine did not have the updated purfling on inside. Solid, simple,sounds great. Needs a compensated bridge to get correct intonation, you can get one from China here on Amazon. Strings will take a week or two of continuous tuning before they settle and hold tune.",2

10056,"I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it's costs more than Amazon.
I think the Amazon price is the best you'll find.

It works as well as expensive tuners. In addition to tuning up the strings, I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation.

Be advised though, that it only registers natural notes and sharps. It does not show a readout of flat notes, instead it shows the ""equivalent"" note. But as violin players know, a B flat is NOT the same as an A#.

But it doesn't just read the letter of the note your on. The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it.

For ten bucks, you can't go wrong.",2
10057,"I'm usually im namds that like it loud. So these help. I don't lose alot of definition and i can ACTUALLY still hear exactly what I'm playing. If these had lanyards so I can pull them out whem we get whisper quiet that wpuld be great. Other than that, its saving my hearing while still letting me hear what I'm doing.

10065,"I wanted to wait a few days and give this guitar some time before I reviewed it. I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.",2
10066,Great starter guitar.,2
10067,"Great pedal!  Not only for guitar volume boost, but also for that over-driven sound, since it preserves the original source signal, without compressing and squashing the sound like so many distortion pedals tend to do.",2
10068,Excellent. Playable nice sounding instrument. Affordable.,2
10069,"All time favorite strings, great feel and balanced tone. Check out the 10s as well if you like a thicker gauge.",2
10070,"I might be inclined to give this instrument 3 1/2 stars if that were allowed, but rounding up is probably more fair than rounding down, so I give it 4. It delivers a lot of value, in that it sounds great, and the parts that matter most are solidly crafted. By that I mean the neck and body - this guitar is made out of nice wood, and looks terrific. I can't really judge the quality of the tuning machine or the bridge, since this is the first instrument I've owned, but I was disappointed by the electronics, which seem to me to be dirt cheap. A few week after buying it I started getting horribly painful buzzing and popping sounds every time my body shifted, and when I took the backplate off to inspect the innards, discovered that the output jack was very poorly soldered. I took the extra step of removing the old solder so I could redo it competently. The jack itself is very cheap and flimsy, and I will probably try to replace it with something better at some point. Upon inspecting the rest of the electronic, I'm rather motivated to replace all of them in the coming years, or else buy a higher quality guitar. So I guess my final verdict is, it's a great instrument for beginners on a tight budget, but you get what you pay for. It will look and sound good for the time being, but you may want to brush up on your soldering skills before buying.",2
10071,"I was kind of expecting the worst when I ordered this- figured it'd add hiss into the signal or break 5 minutes after opening it.
It's actually a nice rig that didn't cause any hiss even through 6 pedals, and the signal never cut out even while walking across the street from the studio.
There are definitely better rigs on the market, this is afterall a ""budget"" item so the whole thing's made of plastic, the belt clip on the transmitter snaps off easily, and the ""standby"" switch on the belt pack causes a noticeable hum.
If you're willing to put up with those like I am, then this is a great buy. Plus it makes you look cool on stage.",2
10072,my favorite strap. padded very well but not too thick. Doesn't get in the way great quality. bought a black one after seeing how nice this one is. super fast delivery,2

10078,"Great tuner even if it is the most expensive one I've ever bought.  But now rather than tuning sometimes, I run everything though it and even in between songs I might glance over and make sure I'm in tune, just awesome and easy",2
10079,Great strings,2
10080,The first three strings follow the transition increase from 11 gauge for the high E. The change happens at the 3-6 strings. They increase is 10gauge increase between each string and ends at low E 52 gauge.,2

10083,Great tone on my resonator!,2
10084,"This was an impulse buy. I knew I wanted another pedal in my effects loop, but I wasn't sure what I wanted it to be.

I brought this pedal home, plugged it into my pedal board and almost immediately wanted to take it back to the store. I decided to take a few more moments with this pedal and downloaded the editing software from the Korg site and began to tweak settings. Because this sits in my effects loop, I don't use any of the overdrives or distortions, I primarily use it for the modulation effects, delays, and as a clean boost to get some additional sparkle.

Although the drum patterns don't sound great, I find myself frequently using them to lock into a rhythm or using them in conjunction with my looper pedal to lay down a backing track.

At the moment, I primarily use it in 1 of 3 configurations:
  1) Tape delay to add that extra wetness to my lead tone
  2) Boost to add that extra bit of sparkle
  3) Leslie for some extra depth

I also use the rhythms when I practice daily. It's truly helped tighten up my playing.

The great thing about this is when I travel, or if I don't want to bring the full pedal board, I can either plug in headphones and practice with this pedal or use it as a 1 stop shop flowing into the PA/

Very versatile!

It only gets 4 stars because the selection knob on the right may not be as accurate as you want it... for example, trying to change from patch 1 to patch 2... you might end up on patch 4, then have to turn and go back...

Other than that, good solid build and a lot of fun... this truly gets used daily!",2
10085,Best strings outthere to use with you Martin Guitar and even other brands the sound is crisp and clear and they last,2

10095,I have bought this item twice! I can say that it's not consistant in the sound! The first pair I got sounds better than the second one. However they both sound nice!,2
10096,Perfect fit for My American Black Texas Special Strat! Nice real leather strap. Looks great together. Is of very good quality leather.,2
10097,"This is a truly excellent practice/busking amp.  Nice size and weight, built like a tank.  The controls are well laid out and make sense visually.  Love the chickenhead knobs!  The amp emulations and the effects are top notch.  Great to be able to play and sing though a single amplifier.  The rhythm section is not a full-on drum machine, but it provides a great variety of beats and sounds for practicing.  Having the rhythm on-board and instantly available is a huge boon for improving my playing.  Easy to use tempo dial.  Unit sounds great and it's fun!",2
10098,my neighbors love them,2
10099,What can I say it's a good mic cable. Was surprised at the thickness. Usually seen in the upper end expensive cables. Will be buying more of this brand cable in the future.,2
10100,"For this price ($5) you can not go wrong. I bought it just to fool around with and it is a very simple pleasant instrument to learn. It produces a nice tone and is easy to pick up and play. It is a fife, not a flute. It does have its own fingering, so use the included chart and you will get much enjoyment out of this.

I can see this being a good beginner instrument to teach kids armature and basics on.

For $5, try it. If you like it, it will be worth much more than that to you. If you don't, you have not lost more than the cost of a burger.",2
10101,"After trying many different types of strings, these are still my favs after 30 years of playing.  They're bright and durable.",2
10102,"Great AB box, the perfect solution for my need....Exactly what I wanted after having a horrible Boss AB-2 that was VERY disappointing...",2
10103,"I should explain at the outset that I am by no means an accomplished harpist. Furthermore, my primary interest has been in using tremolos rather than blues/folk harps. However, I decided to get this to begin playing along with a friend who plays both the guitar and harmonica.

When I started buying harps, I began with lower-end Hohners. These were a disappointment in that the construction seemed pretty cheap and the reeds had a tendency to buzz in the upper register. So I switched to Suzuki harps. As with the Humming tremolo, the Promaster costs a bit more, but I felt the extra expense was worth it. I just was not going to practice on a harp that felt and sounded so-so. And I also discovered that I could get a Promaster for $40 from Best Deals EVA through the Amazon Marketplace. This proved much less expensive than the Amazon Prime offering.

Anyway, this harp is beautifully constructed and a joy to hold. The reeds have a very clear and resonant tone with no buzzing. Even my girlfriend commented on this the first time I used this harp; she felt the sound quality was that striking.  I also own some Promaster Valved harps, but I honestly can't tell the difference between them and this model. More experienced harpists could probably give more instructive comments on this matter.

This harp uses a milled aluminum comb which is cool to the touch. Some people like this, others don't. If this is a possible concern, try switching to the Manji, which uses a composite comb but is otherwise similar in construction. Best Deals currently offers some models of these for 20-30 percent below the Amazon Prime price.

Nothing I say should take away from the competition. I'm sure that, in this price range, Hohner, Lee Oskar, and Seydel all have pretty good offerings. For me, however, the Suzuki brand ensures quality sufficiently well that I will continue buying them.  I hope this helps.",2
10104,"I have the original Roland MicroCube.  As a bass player, everyone thought I was crazy for buying it, but I wanted something that I could play are really low volume after everyone goes to sleep.  It works.  But, the low B on my 5-string sounds like crap.  I tried the CBRX at the store -- what a difference!  The bass response is much better and the amp modeling & effects are designed for a bass, not a guitar.  The added drum loops are a bonus.  I would never gig with something this small, but I could see using it in the studio for going direct.  It actually has nice tone at low volume.  This would be perfect for jamming with a couple acoustic guitars.",2
10105,"Its a really awesome cable!!! The quality is really good, its like it will last forever, it doesnt feel cheap at all but its not the most beautiful cable ever. I had before a mono 1/4 inch or 6.35 mm connector commin from my mic so i had this horrible static noise and after i bought this i pluged it in and wow!! No static at all, you still have the static sound if you crank it all the way up but other than the mixer static itself, its noise free.

Really good cable, i need to mention that is balanced and it has this thing which i don't remember its name that keeps the noise out.

5/5 for the price. Of course if you get a 70 dollar cable it'll probably be better but i don't know how since this is pretty good.",2
10106,Great value.  Works as intended.  Better than another one I bought cheap.  Recommend.,2
10107,This is a great starter blues harp. I've had this Bb and it sounds amazing. I've compared it to other harp brands such as Delta Blues and this low-end brand is better in comparison. I have a couple of Delta Blues harps and have decided to go ahead and replace them all with Johnson Blues King harps!,2
10108,Nice stand for the money.,2
10109,"Well, my husband was just going to buy an extra bow, but he saw this and it was just a bit more, with extra strings and rosin, so he went ahead and paid the extra and got this one.
He considers himself a 'kitchen musician' but he's actually pretty talented and can play about any instrument once he learns how it works.
He is happy with this one - he said it took a while to get it in decent tune because the strings really needed to be stretched out and worn in, but he said it is keeping good tune now, with a decent sound to have fun with.  My son's learning so it is nice to have this extra instrument around.
It's not a symphony class instrument with super resonant sound, but it's great for what we do - just kitchen jam sessions, where everyone grabs an instrument and just plays- if you can't play well, we teach you a couple of notes or give you a drum to use to join in with.
It was a good purchase for us.",2
10110,nice accessory pack,2

Nice and bright.
I heard some bad things about this set but I have to disagree. Even my pro drummers love the way they sound.
Awesome deal!",2
10115,ok,2

10117,This was given as a gift and were much appreciated,2
10118,I ordered two of these stands and they work very well! Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things.,2
10119,I like this little item.  It's compact and does it's job.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's not super sturdy,2
10120,"One thing to keep in mind, these don't hold different thickness picks very well. I have to use 3 on my main mic stand. Guitar players like myself use thin (50mm) picks on one song and may use an (80mm) on another but playing lead, and most the time, I use a (114mm) small tear drop pick. So keep this in mind. This is why I buy and use the shorter size holders! But they do hold 6 of the normal strumming picks as seen in the photo. Other than that they have always been great. I have plenty of extras and have them on up to 4 mic stands on certain stages in different spots of the stage so I can always have a pick, no matter what size thickness a pick is handy!  When working I am all over the stage so along with my stand I put two on the lead singers stand, one on a horn players stand and even the Bass player makes room for me to put one on his stand. This lets me have picks handy anywhere on the stage. They hold the same size picks really well and the picks always slide out easy and don't hold so tight that I move a stand when pulling a pick!  I even keep one on my amp mic stand lol. But I always have picks handy. Pick holders are a MUST for working guitarist.....  These small ones allow many on each stand!",2
10121,I prefer these pics.  They just feel better.,2

10130,"I have been playing guitar for 22 years.  I started out using Gibson strings, then Dean Markley, then on to a brief period of GHS Boomers and Ernie Balls.  For about 10 years, I used Everyly B52 Bombers.  They were great.  After 4 different packs of strings with wonky intonation in the bass register, I started looking for a switch.  I tried Dunlop (yuck) EB (yuck) the EB Cobalts *(better but not great) and ended up at the Daddario sets.
Look, for a reasonable price you get 10 sets of quality strings.  I routinely restring my collection- and it varied from PRS Custom 24s, Fender Strats, Jackson Soloists, Charvel San Dimas, Ibanez Jems, Gibson LPC, and a few other odds and ends- the DAddario provides me with the best bang for the buck.

Are these as good as their NYXL moniker?  Probably not.  However, these will do 99.99999% of the NYXL string job.  Why not save the money and get 4X the strings?

I cannot complain about Daddario strings, and as a matter of fact, I have 3 boxes of 10 on my shelf now.",2
10131,Straight solid quality.,2
10132,Best guitar stand on the market for two guitars. Sad they discontinued the wood finish. Not everyone uses these backstage - mine is in my living room,2
10133,Extraordinarily fun for the price- watch the youtube video comparing it to the boss equivalent- it does very well.,2
10134,"Works great, at an incredible price. Works with gigging too.",2
10135,"This little mixer is adorable. Perfect for an in-ear monitor application, which is what I personally use this for. The build quality is satisfiable for its price point and it is lightweight and portable. I don't see the external adapter connector socket being an issue as mentioned in other reviews.",2
10136,Love them !!!!!! Now I don't keep dropping my picks,2
10137,"Great sound, once these strings are broken in they have a very true tone. Noticed no big change in the strings after 2 hours of playing.",2
10138,Great complement to the Zoom 3Gn.,2
10139,is a good quality,2
10140,"I'm the lead singer in our rock band.  We cover Wilco, Rolling Stones, Mellencamp, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, etc.  I only list these bands because I find it helpful when others tell me their style.  So I've been using Shure SM58 for years and was happy with it.  I was in need of a new mic because my Shure was pretty banged up and I actually would get a small electrical shock on the lips when I got too close to it :)  New mic time, right?  So after some research and having read a lot of positive reviews for the Sennheiser e935, I decided to try it.  The difference was huge.  The straight sound from the Sennheiser is very warm with great clarity.  There's almost no need for any effects (reverb, etc) on the vocals because it has such a great tone by itself.  It makes my job much easier and if you're considering which mic to buy in this price range, look no further.  Buy this microphone and you will sound like a pro on stage.",2
10141,"I got this guitar to use as a ""soprano"" guitar, tuned like a regular guitar but up a 4th, to A. After some adjustments it is totally outstanding for that purpose.

If you want to use the APXT2 as a regular guitar, it is good for that also. I would recommend using heavier strings than supplied, due to the short scale length.

Like any guitar that you buy new, you need to take this to a shop & have the nut action set, and the frets polished. That is true for a $$$$$$$ model or a $$ model. Fairly easy to do yourself, but worth the money to get that done by a pro if you don't know how.

This model has a wide 43mm/1-11/16"" nut, and nice frets. Not a ""child guitar"" at all. Overall well built. The pickup is a transducer, but it does have a preamp. Feedback prone, so don't expect to crank it up super loud through an electric guitar amp without howling feedback. The tone through a regular guitar amp is very nice; great string balance.

I have put these strings on the Yamaha APXT2, after some experimenting: Elixir bronze 80/20 45, 35, 24; Ernie Ball wound 18, and *any brand* 14 & 11. Tunes up to A tuning and holds the pitch great, after a few days of extensive playing. Fat, wonderful sound. Yes these strings are tight; don't try bending much. Or, they might/will snap. Mainly the 3rd & 1st strings.

If you are a jazz guitar player like me, once you get this axe set up you will be amazed at what a great sound and feel it has.
One negative: This thing is a neck diver. Needs to be cradled with the right arm while playing, or it will tip over. You cannot just rest it in your lap & play.

Five stars though. Nothing close to this out there for this $$$.",2
10142,Nice tone,2
10143,Works great. I would recommend this cable.,2
10144,"Ever have a bad G that sounds dead, even when you change the strings? Nope, you won't find that here.",2

10149,"This is a really sweet strap. I use it for an Epi LP Custom, looks great.  Very comfortable with the weight of the LP.  The eyelets can be tight, (good), so I bought strap locks- the way to go.  Very happy with the strap.",2
10150,Hosa makes a quality product and these are no exception.  Not much really to say except they work as they should.  The only better product like this is made by Mogami but is much higher priced.,2
10151,Works fine!,2
10152,Very compact and with unexpected brightness... trying to programme with ADJ 384 DMX controler... came all the way to Kuwait and the package was good... will order more.,2
10153,Don't let the Jazz moniker fool you.  You can play any style with this.  Sound is robust and cuts through a mix.,2
10154,"They last longer but they are spendy.  They sound more like stainless than nickel.  I like the growl I get from them.  I gave them a 4 star review because in the same gauge as my Regular Slinkys they feel thick, tight, not so easy to bend.",2
10155,"These strings are an excellent buy. Once on the guitar, these strings hold tune well sound great. The light gauge works well for speed and heavy bending. The quality of D'Addario strings can't be beat.",2
10156,This AMP is AWESOME!!!!!!! For a Hundred Dollars to me is totally insane for what you get from this AMP. I also bought the Expression Pedal which compliments the AMP and its abilities. nice amp to start out with if you are a first time buyer for a great amp that is worth it's weight in gold.,2
10157,good strings for a great price.,2
10158,Nice cheap effect. Love the small size and weight.,2

10160,We use these at the church and they turned out great for the price. we went back and purchased more we were so happy.,2
10161,A good quality for the money. Using for our sound system at church. You can never have enough patch cables and adapters!,2
10162,"I really like the way these picks feel. The writing adds a nice grip. My only complaint (4 stars instead of 5) is that these picks wear out quicker than the standard Jazz III XL. Despite that, it's my new favorite guitar pick!",2
10163,"This is just electrical tape in pre-cut 1/2"" widths.  This pricing is pretty good for what you get, especially considering I've had trouble finding 1/2"" electrical tape (and in all these colors).  I've used this tape to color-code 8 wireless handheld microphones, their receivers, an 8-channel XLR snake, and magnetic strips for a sound board.  In all these applications, the tape has worked well and seems to be holding up.  I can't yet speak for the future of the adhesive, but I hope it doesn't result in sticky fingers or gear.  From what I can tell from the tape cores, this isn't really ""name brand"" electrical tape, so I don't expect much from the adhesive.  There's definitely a lot of tape here, especially if you're just using it for some microphones and related accessories.  It's not as much as a full roll, but I imagine it's enough for most peoples' applications.  Note that there is no black tape, so all of these colors work on black microphones, cables, mixing consoles, etc.",2

10171,"Best tone I've ever played... Personally, this pedal played with my mustang V solid state amp just make it sound unbelievably good... Every not I feel it so delicate, et powerful. This pedal is very subtle in it's effect, but for those with an ear to listen can tell the amazing rich tone this pedal produces. Please connect it on the FX send return channels of your amp, otherwise if placed in front the pre amp of the pedal will create a little noise...
 All and all... I think my tone has been perfected... Thanks to Joyo and his amazing yet unbelievably inexpensive products... Simply amazing. Buy it, cannot go wrong with the price. I was saving 1,500 bucks for a twin reverb. NO NEED. Not anymore. :)",2
10172,"I bought this strap to use with an acoustic bass that is rather gargantuan,- A Tacoma 4 string, after a bit of adjustment it worked great. Then I bought an ovation 12 string roundback (very roundback this is a deep dish) I needed a strap to make this bad boy sit where I was, so I grabbed this strap off the bass and gave it a shot. After adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great. Now I'm buying another strap so I will have one on either guitar.(I usually keep a strap on all my guitars if the cases will allow it, sure beats taking them off and putting them on)

This strap is very comfortable on an acoustic/electric guitar, probably more so than on a bass as it is supporting less weight. Due to the width of the strap it distributes the weight over a larger area, meaning less pressure on any specific area. This makes it very comfortable. I might change all my guitar straps from 2"" to 3"" now that I've had a taste of comfort.

If you aren't comfortable playing, than you are distracted which removes you from the creative moment. This helps keep you in the moment and in the groove and it don't cost a fortune, plus it holds a pick or two.

I like my phat strap just fine.

Update 9/2016 - Planet waves was acquired by D'addario - current incarnation of this strap is different, perhaps better...
1. no longer has the red and yellow logos on the strap, now all black.
2. they have increased the length of the built in pad by at least 100% making it much more likely it will provide support
where you need it even if you slide your guitar around while playing.
3. leather is a natural material and varies alot, so this may only apply to my strap, but the leather seemed tougher
and harder, which makes getting the strap on a little more difficult, but also means its not likely to fall off once its on, it stays there.
4. it has 2 adjustment buckles - making it easier to change the strap length but still keep the padded strap where you need it.

Its still a very nice strap, and I use it on all my large hollow body/semi hollow body archtop guitars, because they are heavier than most of my other guitars, and it makes it easy to control them and makes it comfortable to play them. So not just for bass guitars, works well on any heavy guitar, you could use it on a light guitar if you like the look and feel. I now own 4 of these straps and have been quite satisifed with them, although only my latest purchase in 9/16 was of the newest model with the longer pad.",2
10173,thank you,2
10174,Like it better than Bon Shoulder Rest.  Grip is thicker.  More protection for instrument.  Otherwise not an noticable difference to me,2
10175,very good,2
10176,"Having performed for over twenty years, I have experimented with a number of different devices that claim to add harmonies or enhance your vocal performance. I've used TC Helicon's Vocal Prism for years in the studio when creating demos or simply fleshing out harmonies and was curious about this product because of it's professed durability and the fact that it does not use any sort of MIDI or other interface to determine harmonic information. Instead it has an active microphone that ""listens"" to what is being performed around it and intelligently applies the harmonies in real time. This is no small accomplishment and I am excited to try it with my band just to see how well it performs. In the mean time, I used it for a fun project equipping voice alteration in a live setting and was duly impressed with the quality of the alteration and received several comments about the device afterwards. The presets are often named either directly or indirectly after recognizable people or characters and the Barry White modulation took my baritone voice way into the thick bass range with little noticeable artifacts. I doubt that this would be my preference for a recording session as there are cleaner sounding devices out there, but for the price, this is one fun voice machine that I expect will find its place in many live performance situations. The effects are nice and there is a karaoke mode that I have yet to try that reduces the lead vocal from any input source (1/8"" jack) and allows you to add your own vocal. Could be great for a impromptu karaoke party or even as bonus attraction for a DJ business. Good bang for the buck and it feels durable. My only reason for not giving 5 stars relate to the power supply and powering up process. This unit uses a ""dreaded"" wall wart power supply which, while not as clunky as others, I fear will not hold up as well as the metal chassis of the device. Also, there is no power button or switch. The unit is always on when plugged in. I suppose this may be to minimize the ""pop"" associated with powering on and off but I am not certain the benefits outweigh the inconveniences. Still, this is lots of fun to use and I would definitely recommend to amateur musicians and singers who want to explore new harmonies and to sharpen their pitch accuracy and possibly to professional musicians looking to enhance their performances a bit. I coupled it with their microphone which feels and sounds comparable to a much more expensive microphone and includes a toggle button that can trigger different effects from the microphone which is a cool feature for live performance. I used it to jump between voices in a dramatic production that required a monstrously low voice and a much higher voice.",2
10177,Nothing beats original. Has stood up to life on the road expertly and hasn't failed me yet.,2
10178,Some say it is windows 7 64-bit compatible.  Others say they are not sure.  I say It worked. 5 Stars since the only reason I bought it was for win7 64 bit compatibility,2
10179,"I bought it to store away an old guitar, it does the job.",2
10180,Im glad I found this! Much better than the old school mic holders.,2
10181,I use it all the time with rechargeable battery. Of course it doesn't sound like a professional amp but it's fine for practicing and the trained ear can hear what it would sound like on the big amp.,2
10182,Very Good,2
10183,"This pedal has been my one and only distortion pedal for 15 years. It can literally do any sound you need. I kid you not, many people ask how I get ""that"" sound, and it's this little box.  Set tone on 9 o'clock, gain at 3 o'clock and output to full, nice, creamy and very responsive. With a tube amp, your otherwise useless volume knob on your axe becomes a tone shaping tool.  Battery lasts for a very long time.
So many guitarists used this pedal for their signature sound, for example Gary Moore.

As with most electronics made in China, something will start going wrong with this pedal after about 5 years.  Usually it's a poor jack connection or the switch.  I just ordered another pedal because mine started turning itself off randomly, I've had mine for 5.5 years.  But regardless, it's a cheap pedal, you can easily go buy another one.  On to Boss DS-1 #3!",2
10184,"I have over 15 years playing experience and I would not have any other strings on my guitar.

I have messed around with many different brands and even the $1/pack I found online (which I wanted to change half way through a set) but there is simply nothing else out there at this price which lasts as long, sounds as good and makes playing such a pleasure as these.

I play mostly acoustic guitar in a one man show and play anywhere from 2-5 hours, though the average is around 3 hours. I finger pick but mostly strum with medium thickness picks. I tune frequently to open chords and there never is a problem.

I never leave home without a few packs in my case in case a string breaks, but I rarely need them until I decide to change all my strings. They last a long time and never seem to loose their vibrant sound.",2
10185,Lots of power. Works well for daisy-changed effects. Adapters are available and can run lots of output types. Cost a little more. but is well worth it.,2
10186,"This is one of my best straps which isn't saying a whole lot, but for what I payed it's works incredibly well",2
10187,fits on splined pots and can take out the insert and works on solid shaft pots with the allen screws. very sturdy.,2

10189,"There is VERY little sound leakage from these, so if you're planning on using them as mains without monitors, be prepared to not be able to hear ANYTHING.",2
10190,"These are awesome for long songs with a lot of page turns.  I use them on a Manhasset Four-score stand, so I have a total of six pages that I can fit on to one stand without any page turns!  The only down side is that they are bent very tightly, so you have to pinch the hell out of you fingers in order to get them around the bottom of the stand.  Not a big deal, but it would be hard for a kid to get them on a stand by them self.",2
10191,Nice tone but will update if stay good for long don't know.  Harmonics there good feel no dead spots and price good.,2
10192,"I keep oscillating between Elixir and D'Addario coated strings on my Taylor 714.  Truth is that I'm not fully satisfied with either.  I like very light gauge strings on all my guitars, but I prefer a slightly thicker G string because I detune and retune frequently, which eventually results in popping the G string. These are decent strings but they tend to be overpriced.",2
10193,guitar string 9.5 between 9 and 10.  Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9.,2
10194,"I am using it to record my garage band's demo to get us more gigs. I have been a gigging musician for over 20 years. Had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it, I had two guitar tracks, a bass track, and drums tracks (from garageband) all laid down. Easy to plug in, I am using it with a MacBookPro and garageband. Very quality recordings so far. Like it so far.
Edit- Put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic (pg-48) used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track, easy to layer over harmonies. Still have yet to mic up a drum kit...Still enjoying the product, still amazed at the ease of use. Did try to install software on a PC with Vista, no luck.
Edit - Mic'd up a drum kit into a mixer, lined it out to this interface, I then mixed the drum mics with the mixer. You can record the drums as a single track so once they're recorded you can not mix them individually (ie. snare, kick and so on). I do get very quality recordings with it set up this way. I am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it, but as for now, I am very pleased.",2
10195,as it describe,2

10198,"Nice, sweet, and very east to tune any guitar. Battery last very long even when used almost daily. checked against other tuners I have with cables and it performed as nice!!!

It has 4 tremelo modes which is abit much bit the optitrem feels the most realistic to me. The univibe is excellent and competes with my mxr reissue phaser and my old ibanez. The univibe is nice and crisp. I was surprised to learn that its digital since its called ""hardwire"" but soundwise its very authentic, much more than their cheesy x-series stuff. If your looking for a basic, classic tremelo I would just get one for less but if you want a tremelo pedal that has alot extras(modes and tap option) than this is good. It has the versatility of a Digitech digital pedal  but sounds much more analog and authentic. Good product and it has a nice clean sound. I give it four stars because I think it has some repetitive modes(4 trem, 1 very wierd and kinda useless mode) and they are chubbier than your boss/ibanez pedals- if space on your board is a big concern.",2

10231,"Don't even know where to begin. I spent the last several months researching the perfect little practice amp I could play at home that wasn't too loud, had great tone, and was easy to record with. I tried out tons of options and was close to honing in on a Blackstar amp but this one just kept coming up in forums as ""the perfect practice amp"". I had a hard time buying into the hype for this little tin box, and was only able to try out the THR10X in a loud Guitar Center so I couldn't quite be captured by the tone. Eventually, after buying a Blackstar BEAM (and quickly returning it for being too weak and glitchy) I finally gave in and ordered the THR10c online to test out at home.

And wow.

Sure, (to get out the bad) it's not the biggest loudest kid on the block compared to other $300 amps, and it can get a little fizzy when fully cranked, but that's not the point of it. It's not a gigging amp, and when cranked even halfway, it's got tons of volume and sounds GREAT.

As for the good. It's hard not to love this thing:
-It looks awesome, the wifey instantly approved when she saw me open it. The black looks great in my studio. The warm glow when turned on is just a cool touch.
-Sounds fantastic. It really sounds natural and lush, and the 5 amp settings really sound like 5 different amps. You get tons of versatility within those. It's not like other practice amps where all the ""channels"" just sound like a louder/gainier version of the last one, each amp setting has its own EQ needs and feels like a different boutique amp. You can get some Fender Blues Jr, some Vox AC, some Marshall, it's just great. Nice range from glassy clean to dirty bluesy crunch. Love that you can save the settings.
-Features! Love the battery power, I can use it anywhere in the house. The tuner is great, aux in is useful, and other amp settings (bass, acoustic, flat) are great perks to have.
-USB recording! Only tried once, but it is super easy to use and gives a pretty nice useable sound.
-Volume. You get plenty. Have to keep it below 50% most of the time. Pretty nice warm sounding bass too, even out of this little box.
-Easy. It's just simple to use! All the knobs make sense and no iPhone app required.

Finally, it's just inspiring. I play it everyday and I'm every time I'm excited to see what tones I can get out of it.",2
10232,"The first one I was sent must have been set up wrong, it was VERY static filled and there was a very loud clock sound with the sweep. Sent it back and the replacement was perfect. So mild inconvenience, but the performance of this pedal more than makes up for it.",2

An amazing pedal with an exceptionally deep feature set, growing user-community & factory settings database and Source Audio provides excellent customer service. While you can dial into a dizzying list of control parameters via the Neuro app, the pedal's on-board controls offer incredible adjustment and customization. There are dozens of YOUTUBE videos showcasing this beast. GEARPAGE has a user-community where you can keep learning more - and Source Audio monitors it and frequently responds to questions and suggestions for improvements. How many stomp box companies do that? SA has upgraded the pedal several times and all you have to do is connect and download the firmware updates.
The quality of the signal is inspiring. The number of engines is impressive. The variety is mind-blowing - delay effects include tape, digital, slap back, oilcan, analogue, sequenced filter, multi-tap and many more. The modulation adjustments will keep you entertained for hours and facilitate the ability to build many of your own unique signature delays.
Crazy stuff? It's in here. Delays can be distorted, flanged, chorused, tremolo-ized, bit-crushed, pitch shifted, reversed... it does a spot-on EQD Rainbow Machine if you want.
On top of all that, it gets along well with other pedals. I run a EHX Pitchfork, FT Mini-Deja Vibe, SA Orbital, FT OCD before it and a Digitech Supernatural and Boss DD7 after. Glorious.",2

10239,"This is a great way to have accessory percusson sounds for my drum set without buying all kinds of expensive accessories (like cowbells, etc.) and their holders, brackets, etc. Not to mention the time and effort consumed in setting all that up every time. An amplifier is, of course, required though. I made a bracket to mount mine to a standard cymbal stand. The first one I got had a pad with a bad static sound when struck. But seller exchanged with no problem. Not an exhaustive number of sounds but more than enough to use as accessory sounds including some bass and snare. An electronic bass pedal can be used but is not included. Neither are cymbal sounds.",2
10240,Perfect,2
10241,"Don't be fooled by the low price. This thing has held up great and the neck is still stiff. The clip can mount to almost anything, you don't even really need to use that fancy of a stand. Works great and does exactly what it's supposed to.",2
10242,"I am not a professional electric guitar player, but I am a professional musician. I have been a music teacher and Jewish cantor for nearly fifteen years. I bought this item to play for my students in my elementary music classroom and it is a big hit with the students. I am using it 100% stock, including the strings. I run it through virtual amp models on my computer and it sounds great. It seems to pretty much stay in tune. I am fine with the action the way it is, although since I have been playing acoustic since high school, I'm used to a higher action than is typically found on a well-adjusted electric. I've had it in my classroom for over a month and have had no issues whatsoever.

Honestly, and here I'm showing my ignorance, but I'm not sure why fancier electric guitars even need to exist. Seems to me that if the thing is in tune most of the sound is produced by the amp, not the instrument itself.

Anyway, if your needs are like mine, you are likely to love this instrument.",2

I have another friend who's also a professional player and enjoys using the thicker ones. He himself admitted it does take a little getting used to, because they raise your teeth up a little more, simulating a slightly thicker mouthpiece.
They are easily put on and removed, I play often and find I rarely have to replace them. It does tend to get grime around the sides where the glue is, which is when I replace them. I've never actually bitten through one at all. I've tried others, and I bit right through them.

10272,"Guitar #1 came and, while it sounded okay but not quite loud enough unplugged, it sounded fantastic with the amp and appeared to be a quality instrument. . . . until I discovered the bottom peg where you attach the strap had fallen out and was lying in loose in the bag and could not be reattached without opening the guitar.  Amazon was simply fabulous about sending a replacement guitar, which I received less than 24 hours after calling!  This replacement guitar looked somehow a little less attractive (with minor flaws in the wood, etc.), and when I plugged it in -- with all knobs and settings identical to Guitar #1 -- there was a constant buzzing or electrical sound.  Then I noticed this second guitar said ""Made in China,"" while the first guitar said, ""Made in Indonesia.""  Because sound is really what this product is all about, I've decided to keep the original Indonesian guitar and attempt to get a music store to reinsert the missing peg under the Ovation warranty.  What does this mean to you? 1) Examine the guitar carefully and plug it in before disposing of the packing materials. 2) Pray your guitar comes from the Indonesian factory 3) If it comes from China and sounds okay, don't sweat it. 4) If it comes from China, Timbuktu or even Staten Island and sounds like something's not quite right - well, in case that happens, order the guitar that's fulfilled directly by Amazon because they are way more willing than other vendors to go that extra mile to make things right.",2

10275,"For the money, I think this is one of the best value effects processors out there.  In my old gigging days and until I retired, I was a tube amp guy.  I had vintage Fender Deluxe Reverbs and I got into putting together and customizing tweed era Fender amps from parts and personally used a tweed Super and a Bandmaster.  (I also had an Allen Old Flame, think 50w Twin Reverb with 2x10"")  I can get close enough tone and 'feel' wise of all my tube amps that I'll give Digitech two thumbs up on their vintage Fender models.  Beyond that, for someone who's looking to put together a very flexible and lightweight gigging and practice rig.. this box along with the 3 button auxiliary footswitch, should get you that.  To my ears, this thing sounds great plugged into a clean amp and/or plugged direct into a PA.  I'm reading reviews about players who are using this box as their amp plugged directly into the PA and I can now see myself using it that way sometime in my future.

I'm running the RP-360 into an old Carvin SX-50 and into the effects loop of a Quilter 101 mini head.  As I said above, I'm very happy with the Fender tones and feel I get through both amps.  I fronted a blues band for years and gigged with a Deluxe Reverb and a Boss OD-1.. and the only reason I used the OD-1 was because I couldn't crank the DR up to 7-8 and use the guitar's volume control to go from clean to OD.  I've got that rig in one patch given the RP360 is in footswitch mode.

One of the reasons I choose the RP360 over Zoom's similar pedal is the Nexus editor and library software.  I had problems getting the update to run using a newer Windows 10 computer.  I did contact Digitech's tech support and they responded within a few hours and we had a dialog through 3 different fix try's.  Coming from a tech support background myself, I thought to try loading the upgrade from an older Window's 10 laptop and it worked on the second try.  So thumbs up to Digitech from me for their tech support.  Love the Nexus tool...  check it out on youtube.

There are lots of reviews out there on this box.  I won't go into any further specifics beyond, it does what it says it does and pretty well for something it's size.  As a roots music type player, it's a really cool option for me now and the less rig I have to haul to a gig and set up, the happier I am.",2
10276,Excellent service and product.,2
10277,"Beautifully deep sound from this bass guitar.  Surprisingly rich and clean for the price.  Didnt have to do much adjustments when i got it.  Just tuned it up and jammed out.

The extras that come with it (case, strings, book) are all just icing on the already delicious cake.

the one problem (not the guitar company or even amazons fault).  Fedex left the package outside in an unusual place near the back of the house because nobody was home.  We got the delivery notification and thought someone had stolen it from the porch.  by the time we found it in the back yard, it had been rained on.  Luckily it was very well packaged and everything inside the box was also in a plastic bag.  Go amazon!",2

10280,"This is a review of Levy's somewhat new line of Faux Crocodile Guitar Straps, the particular model I purchased was the MSS100CR-Red Boutique with Levy's Medallion in Red. The strap comes with Black leather trim which is tough, durable  and very comfortable to wear, for it has a flexibility to it which makes it very comfortable to wear. The quality of the materials used in this strap are of such quality, that there is no reason why this strap shouldn't offer you a lifetimes worth of wear. The strap itself feels sturdy, weighty even, while the Black leather trim has somewhat flexible feel to it, which is rather nice, and very comforting on your shoulder while playing.  The strap appears somewhat darker in color than the pictures suggest, however for me it's very minor detail, there's really nothing I would change about this beautiful strap. I'll buy the Tan model as well, and hope they might come out with some new colors in this line. Levy's Leather is very clear that this is not real Crocodile skin, it is their own top quality leather which has been made to look and appear like Crocodile, and it sure does, I love this strap, and it's worth every penny. I've owned many straps over the twenty five some odd years I've been working professionally, and I must say, I believe this Levy's strap to be amongst the nicest of them all, in quality and design.",2

Not only does the strap look good, but it's very comfortable as well. Plus, the plastic adjuster (hidden behind my back when I play) is unlikely to scratch the wood when the guitar gets jostled around at home. I thought the oval leather branding by Levy's was gaudy, so I cut it off. That's just my incessant need to personalize everything.",2

10287,"Think it sounds like a trash can lid? No, it doesn't. It sounds like a crappy china which has it's place (in the rehersal studio for one...). Want a really good china? Spend more money. That's how it works. Great for practicing. Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone. Poor on recordings (unless you're looking for that... there's always an application). For $20 though, c'mon. What do you want? Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad. It's $20. It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where they've been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3,500 years and you got one for $20. Or go buy a K Kustum and quit your sniveling. I say get one! get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china. boyah.",2
10288,Works Great,2
10289,I love it looks and works very well,2
10290,"For a relatively light instrument like my little Les Paul 100 solidbody, this is fine. The strap is comfortable, and the edges don't cut into the skin of my neck like the edges of a cheaper nylon strap I had did. The length is great; I don't use it as such, but I'd think this might be a very nice strap for an acoustic, or for someone who wants their axe slung down low.

That said, this strap is not as comfortable when used to support a heavier guitar like my Ibanez AM93 (semi-hollow). I think you'd really need a strap pad to make it work for a guitar that weight or heavier, and unless you're a big fan of strap pads (I'm not), you'd likely be better off spending the extra money on a wider strap.

The ends are very thick, so thick that I can't get my 'strap locks' (beer bottle gaskets. Hey, they work great on most straps!) to fit on with them. However, unless the end starts being much more flexible with time, I can't see this strap slipping off very easily, so that's really a plus.",2
10291,"Good price, great delivery!",2

10297,Good,2
10298,Does everything! Stable and the height is great. way better than the first Samson I bought. Can't beat the $$$,2
10299,"Well it is not advertised at this point in time as 5 inches as the other reviewer stated and perhaps their review is the reason why. It is also not 2 inches as it is reviewed now though- It is 2.5 inches at the wide half and the extension strap is 1.0 inches wide. See picture for the scale with tape measure pulled on it.

The color is very nice and don't use the color from my camera phone flash throw you off. This is a nice strap, soft, nicely colored, and reasonably well-made. I paid $11.60 for it on sale but I would pay the $14 or so list price that it is now after buying it once. In fact, I am buying another color one for another guitar next time I buy form Amazon. It also comes with a pick sampler which is OK I guess but I buy the pick I like in bulk already. Guess it is always good to try other occasionally.

So, the only ding is for the apparent inconsistencies in the size/width description which I think should be easy to clear up. 2.5"" main with 1"" extension.

RATED 4.5 STARS - This is a solid buy.",2

10303,"I've used Earthwood Light 80/20's for a few years now and still am impressed each time I replace, stretch, then tune; the 'ring' they have is amazing. I will not use any other ACOUSTIC strings as long as these are available. They aren't expensive and last as expected. Great Job, Ernie Ball !",2
10304,"Pros - works exactly as described and it is very accurate

Cons- only one and that is understanding probe tuning movement- after trial an error found that to the left is flat on the notes and right is sharp on the notes from the center ---which is not explained in the instructions very well but easy to figure out...hey you read it here. ( YouTube has some videos that address this too)

Hint:on how to use: Watch for when the probe stops moving the string is in tune....By experience I've learned to set the display option button near the top of the unit to option #3 as it is best for me..why? answer: the strobe doesn't light up all the led lights as it moves left or right passing the center...which is distracting...fine for a light show but not for dialing in your tune ..other options are available but strobe #3 works very well,..oh and as a plain tuner in option 1 that works well too.. Really like mine :-)",2
10305,Works. No issues.,2

10316,I am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables. I have used them with my bands PA system and they work nicely. I would and do recommend them to anyone looking for quality at an affordable price.,2
10317,Cant say enough about this. Works well and sounds great!,2
10318,"I bought this to use on a tom stand that has a clamp built in for an additional tube. It works perfect for this and is made well and looks nice. It isn't the highest end piece as far as features go, which is why it is a ""standard"" arm. There is only one wing nut that locks the boom arm in position instead of a separate one for angle and another for the arm itself. That makes this one a little more fussy to get set but it's not terrible. The tilter for the cymbal itself is a standard type with teeth. The teeth are pretty fine though so it allows pretty decent adjustability.

It's basic nature doesn't keep it from doing its job though and it is well enough made that it should hold up to years of use. If you set up and take down your set often (play gigs) this may not be our best choice. The basicness of the adjustment could get frustrating in time. For someone who leaves their drums setup and in one place there is no reason not to get one of these.",2
10319,Great price for this product.  LaVoz reeds last for a long time and are wonderful for a mellow saxophone sound.,2
10320,"I am very pleased with this mixer, especially at this price point.  Preamps are quiet with a lot of headroom.  I'm creating a Digital Audio Workstation for home recording and this Mixer does the job very well.  I've read others complaining about the FX (including Echo and Reverb).  IMHO, I purchased a 12/2 inexpensive mixer.  The FX settings are from 00 to 99 and isn't well defined in the documentation. During a practice session, I experimented with each one to get an idea of how they sound.  For a mixer at this price point the FX is very good.  Echo and Reverb are the best I've heard so far.  Of course, this isn't like the cheaper units out there where FX is in line.  FX on this unit is a remix and is added to your existing sound. The volume of the remix (FX Volume on main) will affect the sound greatly.

I would recommend this to anyone who is creating a home recording studio and wants a really nice sounding mixer with lots of headroom and easy to use.  This mixer is well worth the investment.",2
10321,Awesome!  :-),2
10322,"It's simple, small, and packs a punch. Throw this sucker in front of a dirty tube amp and unleash your true tone. It's built like a freakin a tank.

10323,"I owned a hot plate and it worked fine but at the price this works the SAME!  I own 3 of these. 1 for my Peavey Classic 30 @8ohm and use this for my Classic 50 4/10 @16ohm and have 1 for a backup. I play with an 8 piece band, we do Joe Bonamassa type shows and at rehearsal I`d blow everyones ear drums out with out it. I have NP getting that Bonamassa tone with any of my Les Pauls. It does get hot when I have my amp cranked but you get that with any one you use! It simple to use, the amp has a 1/4in jack lined from the speakers and plugs into the amp. This goes between the two. I use an 1/4in extension so I can sit it on top of my amp and access it easily to control the volume. ITS SIMPLE!  I can crank my amp at home and have the volume so low you can talk over it while I'm playing. I`ve owned it for just over a year now and it still works great, and I use it almost everyday!  I`d say in most cases the ole ""You get what you pay for"" works but not with this. Carl will save you a LOT of scratch so give it a try, do what I done, try it out then get another for a backup, there so cheap you can afford to. LOVE THIS BABY!!!!!!!
UPDATE 2/8/17
I`ve used it for just over a year only at mid volumes, I`m using it on a Peavey classic 50, lately we done a few shows where I needed more so I turned up the volume on my amp to 8 and even 10 (All the way up) for 3-4 hours. It got HOT, Real Hot! I still had all the tone I could want with no problem at all. But while packing up the last 3 shows, I had to leave it for last. I couldn't even touch it. I will post a pic soon. It melted the black cover around the volume knob lol YES IT MELTED and WARPED!  But its STILL WORKING! WOW  These are like tanks! I switched to my new backup for shows and use the melted one for home use now and it still sounds great. But BE SAFE. They get HOT when cranked! REALLY HOT!",2
10324,"I didn't expect much...especially with it being so cheap.  It has an amazing sound.  Perfect for practicing on a bus or sitting around.  It's worth every penny and it's rugged.

10328,"The alto/tenor players in my household prefer these ligatures over the traditional 2-screw ""H"" style ligatures and over the seemingly more advanced fabric style ligatures.  They say the shaped indents on the metal bands really hold onto the reed better (less movement) than basic ligatures or fabric straps.  Not only is the one screw easier to manipulate than two screws, but the one screw also makes the mouthpiece-ligature-reed assembly easier to grip and manipulate when tuning the instrument (positioning the mouthpiece more or less on the neck) as the screw doesn't get in the way of fingers like two screws do.",2

10339,"I purchased this unit from one of Quilter's B&M dealers in November 2015.  With a couple dirt pedals this has replace my Mesa Triaxis/2:50 rig as my goto amp. It is so easy to move my Mesa stays at home and hasn't left its corner since I've purchased the 101.

I've only use the Lead and Surf voice. Surf voice when I have a tribally cab; lead voice when the cab is too bassy. I keep the gain around 2-4 and use this as a pedal amp. I've never needed to max the volume, this easily keeps up with the band, 50 watts rating is about right.

All that said, I do miss the multi-channel Mesa. I am looking at Mesa's new TC50, but I probably will stay with the Quilter, it is just too easy to just throw into the gig bag and go. The 101, a 1x12, a few pedals, and I am set.",2

The back of the box claims ""New super low-noise preamps"", and they're not kidding. It really is impressive for a recorder of this size and price. The are a ton of features (the manual is 150+ pages!), many of which I'll probably never use in a video production setting (karaoke mode, built-in effects).

The recorder runs off AA batteries, which are included. There is no SD card included. A nicely form-fitting clear plastic case is included - I wouldn't rely on it to protect the Zoom recorded from extreme knocks, but it is a very nice bonus nonetheless.

This recorder is a great piece of gear to have in your video production kit. It has excellent quality, a lot of features, and is very reasonably priced.",2
10347,"One of the big hassles with delay pedals is getting the wet/dry mix and delay times set up the way you want without bending over and fiddling around.

The Ernie Ball Expression Series Ambient Delay makes it easy to adjust both quickly and during a performance. In order to set delay times, you'll need to use a momentary contact external switch (not included, but easy to make if you're handy with a soldering iron). Controlling Wet/Dry mix is a matter of rocking the pedal between heel (dry) and toe (full effect) positions.

The Ambient Delay is an attractive rose-gold color and is literally built like a small tank. I've been using their volume pedal for the last year and both are built very well. Based on how well the Ambient Delay works, I'll probably pick their Expression Series Overdrive soon.

There is a custom plastic nut for securing/protecting the cymbal, though, and I'm not a fan. The sleeve is built-in to the plastic nut, which screws in from the top.

10363,"I'm not an amateur musician, but an amateur on ukulele. November 2012 I ran across a new all wood electric concert uke at a guitar store and bought it on impulse.  Then I could not play a lick on uke, it was just a ""saw it and want it"" thing.  Now I can play a little (thank you Dr. Uke internet ukulele tabs) and I own 3 solid wood ukuleles of various sizes plus this Dolphin.  After buying the first uke I actually started paying attention to uke reviews and noticed these MAKALA DOLPHINS get consistently positive reviews everywhere and I put it on my radar for a beater travel uke.

This week I lucked into my Yellow Burst Dolphin for $20 in a consignment store.  It has what seems to be the original black nylon string set and the dustcover bag in the original box. No wear at all so it is like new.

The first thing I noticed was when chorded it is mighty loud with stock Nylon strings.  The second thing was that it plays very easily as the strings are close to the fretboard.  After getting it home I checked it with a Snark 2 electronic tuner and the intonation up the neck is actually better than on one of my more expensive all wooden ukes. The intonation is spot on.  Remarkable for any ukulele but for under $100 it is seldom seen.

Even at the retail price new, the Dolphin is a good value.  Many low end ukes (and frankly some famous name ones that are supposed to ""make me happy"") have poor intonation.  Poor intonation means when you tune to an open note and go to the 12th fret which is the octave that it is out of tune. Some ukes are off by the 5th fret. On ukes with poor intonation chording up the neck sounds bad because the ukes are not in tune much beyond the open chords that you play on the first 3 frets.  It also makes it difficult to use the uke for anything serious involving playing with other instrumentation.  This Dolphin uke chords in tune up the neck.  Having tried out a bunch of ukes I can say the intonation on this Dolphin is one of the most impressive things about it for the money. I'm floored.

Many reviews say it is a great starter uke, but it actually holds its own compared to much more expensive ones.  I find myself playing the Dolphin about exclusively since I got it.  It is just FUN! I love the tone of my all wood tenor acoustic but there is something about playing the partly plastic Dolphin I like. This Dolphin is as loud as can be for a little uke!  I think the injection molded polycarbonate plastic back and sides of the body have something to do with the hot projection and the agathis top helps sweeten what would otherwise be a loud plastic based tone. The tone is something like the Fluke Flea if you've tried one of those out.

Other good things are the geared tuners that hold tuning better than friction peg tuners, the smooth frets, the large bridge design which conducts string vibration to the top and in general pretty good finishing.  Swell little uke!

Not so good is the gigbag which is little more than a slip on dustcover.  It does protect the strings from sun damage but it has no padding at all so it isn't protecting against much but dust and sunlight.  A gigbag with padding is probably a good idea for a travel uke.  Pull open the Velcro tab at the bottom of the dustcover and the uke slips in and out. It is a shroud, not a gigbag really.  Also not so good is that the fretboard side marker dots are specks of paint and not actual inlaid markers.  I expect them to wear off soon, but that is no big deal since I have a black Sharpie pen and can ink them back up as needed.

I highly recommend this as a starter uke for a beginner because it is super easy to play, sounds great, plays in tune and is loud.  If a beginner can't learn to play with this uke, then they really didn't want to learn uke at all and you aren't out a lot of money. If they don't learn it can not be blamed on the Dolphin because the Dolphin will not hold them back or fight against them.  There are many more expensive ukes costing up to three or four times as much that are harder to play, are not as loud and that do not have such good intonation.  I also recommend it to demanding experienced players looking for a travel/beach/lakehouse uke.  I'm honestly amazed.  This is a lot of uke for the money and wish I'd bought it sooner, as in FIRST.  I also wish they made a Dolphin in tenor size because I'd be buying one.

I can't give it 5 stars because it isn't the best ukulele in the world.  For what the Dolphin costs, it is truly the one to get for a budget beater!  I've not seen a sub $100 uke that plays or sounds better than this partly plastic thing.  Pick out whatever color you like, but get one of these Dolphins.  Just a little bundle of fun!  Add a Snark SN2 tuner, maybe a spare set of strings and hit the internet for free ukulele lessons and tabs and you are playing in a few minutes.  You really only need the Dolphin, a tuner and some uke tabs online and you will be playing in 10 minutes! (Spare strings are always good to keep on hand.)  This uke appears to come stock with either the GHS Hawaiian BLack Nylon set or one close to it and that set is easy to find and carried at most music stores.  I have been using Aquila Nylgut strings exclusively but on this uke I like these black nylons fine and will get a GHS Hawaiian set to have on hand.

Overall and not just for the money but against all the ukes I've tried in the past year regardless of price, the Dolphin gets a solid rating of 8 out of 10.

It actually sounds better than this recorded DEMO:  [...]

****UPDATE! At the 2013 Summer NAMM show in Nashville (where manufacturers exhibit their products to dealers) Kala debuted a new model, THE SHARK which is a soprano.  THE SHARK is essentially a DOLPHIN with the same exact hybrid body construction, but THE SHARK has different finish options in satin instead of gloss. Oh and instead of the cutesy dolpin shaped bridge it has a slightly bigger and more intimidating GREAT WHITE SHARK shaped bridge! The colors for the SHARK model are all solid satin colors with no bursts.  I'm getting a SURF GREEN SHARK as soon as possible and expect them to be reaching dealers in the next month or so.  Surely they'll be at dealers by the 2013 holiday gift season!  Here is a link to see the Shark model next to the Dolphin model and the new Shark satin colors:

10374,"First, I would like to say that if I could give this 4.5 stars, that would be more fitting. Reason? I don't like to give 5 star reviews, unless the product is absolutely perfect for my needs and use. Having said that, this bridge improved my tuning stability and it done so for around 10 bucks. It was 13 when I purchased, it is now 8, so 10 is what well call it. I would also like to mention that my Schecter Blackjack SLS came with an actual Tonepros bridge (T3BT, I think?) stamped Tonepros on the underside of it. Those aren't cheap by any means, so for this very cheap roller bridge to be better at its job than the Tonepros should tell that company all they need to know about continuing to put these on expensive guitars. I cannot say that the rollers will last as long as the Tonepros bridge would have lasted, based on a picture uploaded here, I would say not. This isn't the Tonepros roller bridge I am talking about, obviously. I am just so stoked that I am not having to retune all the time with the rollers, thats a fact. I won't get into sustain and all that because I did not A/B them and I don't notice a difference. Its strictly tuning stability for me. I originally wanted, and still do, the super adjustable roller bridge that Schaller makes but 60 bucks vs 10, I couldn't pass this up. Now that I know this concept does indeed work, maybe later on Ill get the schaller, if the rollers get grooves in them or something else goes wrong with it. For the price, you cant go wrong and thats why this gets 5 stars, in relation to its price point. This could easily be sold for 20 if they were made with brass rollers instead of zinc alloy (pot metal.) Cons for this bridge: Intonation is time consuming and could be more streamlined, so to speak. But, going back to price, hard to argue. The only other con for me is the rollers are all the same size, if you bend to hard on the high e or even the next string up for some, you can hear it moving on the roller. I thought my string was breaking at first, but it was just moving a little. Thats all I got.",2

10379,"Appears to do the tuning job for which it was purchased.

I prefer the display setting #2 so the center LED doesn't stay lit until it is dead on.

The bypass button does not create signal noise, and acts as a mute when tuning. You can feel the button switch through your shoe, but to actuate is not so firm as to require too much pressure.

It is a metal body but the underside is uninspiring plastic with 2 pedal-width strips of rubber for feet. The bottom has the only markings, molded into the black plastic, indicating the input and output jacks. Input is on the right side, looking down on the tuner.
The battery door kept falling off until I latched it - just.right. I put a piece of gaffer's tape on it anyway.

The 9v power input and output (you can power through) connectors are located next to each other, but are screen printed in gray on a black case, making it hard to see, so you'd better know which is which if setting up on a dark stage.  I've made a mental note that the output jack is the more outboard connector. The output is rated at less than 300mA so what all you daisy chain past this pedal might be limited.

I'll update this post if I have any troubles.

September 2014 - Ok, yeah - engaging the button does create a signal noise after all, contrary to my earlier post. My work-around is that I suggest not hitting that button during a show if you can't mask that pop.

The LEDs are not bright enough in direct sunlight. The are bright enough to be seen on a stage with good lighting, but not at an outdoor venue when the sun is shining directly on the tuner.

Other than that, it is still doing its job - tuning.

April 2015 - The tuning range is too wide. It'll show it is in tune but it is not close enough for me. I use it to get close and then still adjust it the rest of the way by ear. You also have to pause a moment between strings for it to show the correct note. I've stopped hauling it to traveling gigs and use it as a stage tuner at church. It is still working...

January 2016 - I quit using it. Soon after the April 2015 post I replaced it with a Snark headstock tuner. For my pedalboard I just bought a Polytune 2 - It is the brightest, fastest and most accurate tuner I've ever used. See my review on the Polytune 2.",2

10383,"This is the first product of many i've bought from amazon that i actually feel compelled to write a review for. i've owned this ""portastudio"" for over about 2 months now, and i love it. the coolest thing about it is the practically unlimited potential it has. once you get past those initial ""how the *&^$ do i do this?!"" moments, you can take this thing as far as you want, and probably a little farther. i admit this is the most complex recording device i've ever bought, and to me, just the sheer amount of control over every aspect of the music was great. panning, punching, track editing, simple but effective EQ adjustments, a good variety of effects for bass, guitar, vocals, and even drums all combine to make the final mastering process pretty exciting (and challenging, depending on how crazy you want to get with it).
i would strongly recommend getting a good mic to use with this, instead of plugging an instrument directly into the recorder. i play electric guitar among other things, and this device simply doesn't have enough options on it's own as far as creating your own unique guitar sound.
oh, and did i mention when you're done with whatever you're working on, you can burn the song(s) to a CD using this device?
guitar players- get a good amp, and a good custom tone using effects outside of this. get a good mic, and a small boom mic stand, and mic up your amp.
vocalists- in my opinion, this thing has everything you need if you have a mic. lots of cool effects to use on your voice that can give it that extra more professional sound.

10387,These reeds are easy to play and sound great.,2
10388,Great product,2
10389,"I've been playing one of these since 2009 so I have a fairly well developed opinion of this device. Overall, the delay effect is the best on the market right now. It's a cinch to use, and having a tap tempo built right into the pedal is AWESOME. As a user (and abuser) of delay in my effects, I can tell you, tap tempo is KEY. The delay on this guy is warm and fuzzy sounding, for lack of a better word, and this has a lot to do with the analog simulation. Definitely a plus. The multiple tape head position simulation settings add a neat dynamic to the delay effect you cannot get with most other delays, which is also nice.

The reverb leaves something to be desired. I find to to be just passable - nothing special. This is coming from someone who is used to spring-mechanical fender reverbs, so my tastes may be coloring my opinion somewhat, but I find the reverb here to be a little dead sounding.  One thing that I definitely don't get is why there isn't a separate on/off pedal for the reverb, or at least a port on the back to hook up a switching pedal to do the job - that would've been quite handy. My sound is such that I frequently have a need to turn delay on & off, but I leave my reverb going throughout - there is no way to accomplish this if you are using this pedal as your primary delay/reverb box. This severely limits the usefulness of the reverb effect in my opinion.

With the exception of the aforementioned lack of a switching mechanism for the reverb, the selection of ports on this device are pretty good - stereo/mono in/outs, switchable direct out, a jack for an expansion pedal for controlling things like intensity, etc, make it a pretty flexible device.

My biggest complaint is that 3 years after buying my first unit, it developed a strange side effect - when the device is in bypass mode, the whole signal is cut out - this is NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR, in this respect the Space Echo should work like every other pedal in the market, passing the clean signal through when the effect is disengaged. Despite this I bought a second one, because I need that Space Echo sweetness for my rig, and anyway I am of the opinion that this is just a random fluke and not endemic in the line. I've had tons of BOSS pedals over the years and this is the first time -I've- had any problems with one, although it should be noted that a friend of mine bought a tuner not too long ago and it was bad out of the box. It makes me wonder about Roland's quality control as of late...

Anyway 4 stars:
Pros:
 - Awesome delay: the best on the market in a pedal.
 - Excellent array of ins/outs.
 - BUILT IN TAP TEMPO

Cons:
 - Price: expensive for a single purpose guitar pedal. Arguably worth it.
 - Reliability:  First one only lasted 3 years before developing a weird quirk.
 - Lack of a switchable way to engage/disengage the reverb seems like an oversight.",2

10391,I love my padded leather Levy's strap but it's expensive. I wanted to get a 2nd one but didn't want to spend so much. I saw this strap and decided to give it a shot since it was about 1/3 the price. The strap looks great. I got the black one. It doesn't look quite as nice as the Levy's but still looks good in it's own right. It is very comfortable. It causes no pain and doesn't slide around on my sholder. I can play for hours without any issues.  It has plenty of padding without being to bulky. I have since bought 2 of these and plan on getting more. If you want a nice looking and feeling paddes strap then this is it.,2

10395,"This review is based soley on the one string I bought the pack for. All my life, no matter what guitar, no matter how expensive, the g string ALWAYS sounded wrong and would come out of tune for no damn reason. After some research, I find that guitars are meant to have a wound g string and I had to try. I strung it up on my Les Paul Signature and after the usually stretch out, I noticed an instant difference. Solid. Precise. Beautiful. I had concerns that it would be difficult to bend, that's all I heard of in terms of drawbacks. It is different for sure but it's not hard. I got used to it fairly quickly. All in all I must say, I'm never going back to unwound g strings and I implore you, if you have been plagued by sour g strings, you must try these. They work.",2

10397,"First of all the cons.... a bit heavy, no DSP.
Now the pros......This amp ROCKS. I did a side by side comparison against the Crown XTI4002 which is a very popular and capable amp and I was pleasantly surprised. There was no noise or distortion and plenty of power. I do not need the DSP because I use a DBX driverack for all my processing. Most amps these days seem to all have DSP but if you don't need it, that money is wasted so this amp works great for me. I use all Crown amps in my PA rig and I have had no problems with any of them. For the money this amp would be hard to beat!!",2
10398,Just what I needed for the application. Great price and fast shipping. Use this between my drum machine and the amp. Should last a long time.,2
10399,"I wanted to keep my guitar amp (Line 6 Spider IV 75 watt) on the floor for best bass response, and I wanted it angled to hit my ears, as my knees don't have ears and cranking a floor amp without stand so that you can hear will cause the audience's ears to bleed. So I bought this stand and...IT WORKS! It angles my amp back about 37 degrees (I have a measuring tool) so when I'm about six feet away, it's pointed at my head. When I place my amp on the stand, it's nice and straight. The angle of the bottom and back sections is slightly more than 90 degrees; the back of the amp is flush against the back bar, and there's about a 3/16 inch gap between the bottom bar and then bottom of my amp. But the amp is secure, it doesn't move around, and the stand can handle to weight no problemo. My amp has an open back, but the two vertical tips of the back bar contact the top of the back of my amp by about 1/8 inch, so it's secure. Even if it didn't reach it, things would still be secure.

I like that it folds up for convenience and space savings. It's not heavy at all, and it looks like it'll survive road use. I'm happy with my purchase. There are rubber feet underneath, so it shouldn't scratch up a floor.

OK, there's one quality-control thing I should point out. The bottom bar was a little crooked, but I was able to bend it straight with my hands.",2
10400,"In reference to the other sub $100 LD mic's, it leads the pack.  Good for applications such as vocals.  The hard mount provided is useless, though",2
10401,It holds picks. It sticks to things.,2
10402,use them all the time,2
10403,"Good bag. 2 mms padding, lots of pockets with zippers. Even has 3 ways of carrying/holding the bass. On the back/shoulder, on the side, and in the middle. Holds my full sized bass perfectly with good balance and comfort. Has pockets to fit my book and cable and mini amp if needed or wanted.
Came rolled up in a medium box. Better than folded up with left over creases. The zippers took a little while to work right because the pockets weren't completely straight from packaging, but after a couple of zips they seem to be aligning, straightening up. Good bag.
Also good with lots of pockets for about $20.",2
10404,Used these to recycle old gibson bass that was destined to trash heap. These pickups and new pots pickguard turned junk into nice guitar again. Body and neck were too good to trash. $50 worth of parys and an old throw away is valuable again,2
10405,"This does the job fine: gives me an audio out from my laptop's USB port, without having to use the laptop's headphone jack (and crummy associated circuitry). I could hear the difference immediately and it was not trivial. Most times I run this off to a stereo receiver, but I use the headphone jack rather than the two phono jacks, because the latter give me some very low-level hum. There's no hum when using the headphone jack. great unit for the price.",2
10406,Well it works. Easy to put together too.,2
10407,"This Fog machine is excellent.  We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing it due to some of the negative comments...although it was labeled #1 Best Seller on Amazon website.  We have a fairly spacious house especially downstairs and it fogged up the living room, dining room, kitchen, and my tea and crumpets room. It took a while for the spoke to clear after turning it off. It's sturdy & easy to carry.",2
10408,Great tipper !!!,2
10409,"If you play bluegrass or anything related to it, and you're not running EXP74, chances are you are using J74 sets! Most pickers (of bluegrass and/or its derivatives) prefer playing these over the rest. I've gone back and forth over the years, trying other string sets - even those of (shock, horror) other manufacturers. FYI: Chris Thile endorses the EXP75 set, and says they last him three times as long as the (uncoated) J75, affording him to play three gigs instead of just the one on J75 strings.",2
10410,Love these strings. Most of my Ukuleles came with them. If they didn't I will change them. I find them pleasant to play and they sound better. Only draw back is they do take a little time to stretch. I tine them stretch them by pulling up mid string and tuning them again. Can take a few days before they hold tune.,2
10411,These are excellent strings. I love Ernie Ball,2

10415,I love the low G red string and have it on all my ukeleles - I love the warm sound it produces compare to the high G string,2
10416,"Very cool. Tracks the guitar input (I have my Korg SG plugged in there) a little slow and watch your vocal vibrato - once that's done, used on the right songs it is very nice. The lower harmony is not very usable, but my voice is lower to start with - that's not a fault of the unit. For the price it's a very solid unit, easy to use and, used tastefully, can be a great extra tool for small groups or soloists. Just don't overdo it.",2
10417,Works,2
10418,"Follow instructions carefully! Bass and treble levels should be at approx. 1 and 2 o'clock position and input to Singtrix should start off at approx. 25% for starters . Otherwise the sound quality will distort and hide the sound effects. Wish they had a slide control for voice pitch, although they have many presets. When using a guitar, there will be a delay ,(latency) and to remedy this , press song voice and my voice buttons at the same time for 5 seconds. Nice portability, less clutter. USB? has input but as with other brands, web sites cost money. Presently, I'm using wireless remote head mics and wireless remote jacks  to plug into guitar. When using other speakers, more treble is useful, when using this device.",2

For the price, its a very good LED lighting unit that will last you for many gigs down the road.",2

10427,These tuners are great and the price was even better,2
10428,It's a TC Flashback that should say it all!,2
10429,"Gave it a 5 star because it simply does what it has to, and does it pretty well.

When ordering this pin I had the view of it being something big and bulky but I totally amazed at how ""small"" it was,  let's say it not much bigger than the end pin the bass came with originally so it doesn't give the bass an odd look. It's just the shape that prevents the strap from coming loose.
If you're concerned about the aesthetic of you bass/ guitar this is it.

Pros:
Not over-sized;
Comes with 2 different sizes of screws (although you may want use the original ones if they are longer;

Con:
Would like felt washers. (Totally nitpicking)",2
10430,Love these strings and quick delivery,2
10431,"This is a very nice capo. I've been using a Kyser quick-change capo for many years now and this one is a copy of it, but they improved on their tried-and-true design.

The first obvious thing I noticed was the size difference. Overall it's a slightly bigger capo with a much wider handle and a longer fret bar. The Kyser's is about 2 inches while this capo adds another 1/2 inch. A half inch might not seem like much, but on wider fretboards like 12 string guitars, longer is better (that's what she said). On the other side of the neck spectrum, it still works great on narrow necks like mandolins. While it is bigger in size, it's still very lightweight and weighs a mere half ounce more than the Kyser but still a strong enough metal. It would probably suck as a hammer, but more than enough for a capo.

The second thing I noticed was the rubber material. At first I thought it was just plastic, but after using it and pinching down on it I realize it's a hard rubber that rebounds when it's pushed against. The Kyser has rubber as well but they are much softer and have more give. This capo's harder rubber material clamps down much better across all the strings. Depending on the instrument, sometimes the Kyser doesn't fully clamp down on the lower strings and I'll have to set it at an angle to get them to stop buzzing or fretting out. So far on the guitars I've tried it on it keeps them all down tight and the strings all ring out like they should. Another feature is the bottom grip that has a curve cut out to fit the contour of the neck. This, along with the longer fret bar, seems to be how it fits a variety of necks well. All in all a very nice functioning capo. Plus they throw in some picks. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2
10432,"Good value, long lasting strings. Play every day for an hour or hours. Strings last about a month before they seem to loose some tone, even then, seems like they might still work well for another period of time.",2
10433,"I got this for playing guitar in my continued quest to find a good seat for extended playing/practice.
I agree with some other reviews of this:

Good:
* Very well constructed & sturdy.
* Good quality metal, good finish and the seat materials seem quite good.
* Quite stable and stays put without any rocking.
* The fasteners secure the legs, set and height adjustments well and they stay locked.
* Breaks down nicely for travel/storage.

Not so good:
* The seat pad is FIRM [and I'm not expecting it to soften up much with use.  [My posterior started to get numb after about an hour of practice].  I stuck a foam pad on it as was able to play more.  Extended sessions of sitting on this may not be possible for me.
* The lowest height setting wasn't quite low enough/where I wanted it.  I'm 5'9"" and I want my thighs to be parallel to the floor when seated.  I modified the seat post by sawing 2.1 cm off the bottom, then drilling a new hole for the cross bolt.  This got it right where I like it.  I could see where shorter folks might have issues with the lowest height setting.
* It does swivel even with the under-seat fastener tight, but it looks like rotating the seat causes the end of the fastener bolt to scrape against the bolt and may eventually end up creating a groove there [that may continue to deepen with wear].

Overall, a well made, sturdy, stable, portable stool that could benefit from a lower height adjustment and slightly softer seat pad",2
10434,"I have the Nickel Plated instrument, silver keys and body. Out of the box it is the most beautiful sax I've ever held. It came ready to play with 11 reeds, ... one ready in the mouthpiece.

As for sound, so far so good. I am an older jazz saxophonist and I find variation of the reed and mouthpiece necessary to test different sound qualities.  I took it through the paces, all the scales, some improvisational play w/ two different mouth pieces, 7 different reeds. One pad was sticking, so I put a little oil on it. The reeds aren't the greatest (the Glory reeds are much better).  Other than that, it plays fine.

This is the third low-cost mainland China sax I've tried.  A lot of the great sax players were dirt poor when they started, and these low cost instruments may be all the future musicians have initially.  My first test was an Antigua student model rented for my son, then a Glory and the Mendini off Amazon.  They all are manufactured from a similar/identical CAD design based on a high end Selmer Paris (built with lower quality materials).

The Mendini is the best of the three I've tried so far.  The key springs were more stiff and the sound less bright than my higher end Antigua pro, but that may be due to the newness of sax.  With a good mouthpiece and seasoned reed, the Mendini has been really nice to play ... and it looks and feels great.  I had a Bundy and Vito when I was a kid ... this is nicer.

FYI, I ignore sax reviews that aren't from verified purchasers.  The most popular negative review seems to be from someone who never bought this sax.  Also, be cautious of reviews from new sax players playing with a new reed.  Reeds need moisture and get better with use.  They also need a well trained lip to really good sound.",2
10435,My hubby really loved this guitar case. All we could say is WOW!!!!!! I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The price was really great and there was not one thing wrong with it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for something of good quality. I am still thinking about getting him another one for Christmas. You definitely cannot go wrong with this. The price is totally worth it. If you are looking for this then look no further because you will be very happy with this case. Hope you enjoy!!!!!!!!!,2

10437,LOVE IT,2
10438,"I cannot rave about this light enough. You really don't need a DMX if you're running this light in sound reactive mode. The sound reactive mode works really well on changes to the beat, and bass. I do songs that go from a pounding 808 & dirty 909 at 150bpm then drop down to a track running 90bpm with nothing but vocals, some congas, and a guitar. This one stays on the ball with it, and doesn't over react to mellow, and chillout sounds. When it changes to spinning blue or just straight blue at any time it turns into a giant moving black light. The clubs around here lighting sucks for doing something other then having a few can lights shining on the stage, and then some huge white lights. That's all you get at clubs around here. I do not do a show without this, and you add a fog machine to it you are set. I have a small inexpensive lighting rig that works well enough that after I am done with the set DJ's after me have commented on stage to the audience how cool my lights are, and they need a set up like that. I have also had other DJ's, and bands ask if they can use my lighting rig after seeing it. If you want a cheap, but awesome set up here is my advice. Get a Jellydome, a Jellyfish, micro Galaxian, and a portable T-bar (just make sure it is strong, and heavy duty). Drill a hole just big enough to fit the mounting screw to the Jellydome from front to back where the bars met to form the T. Mount the Jellydome horizontally, then mount the Jellyfish on the far side on one bar, and the micro Galaxian on the other. After that all you need is a fog machine, and you have a massive rig that doesn't cost a fortune, you don't need a DMX controller for, and is totally sound reactive. This is an awesome set up, and a K.I.S.S. (keep it simple silly) set up that isn't going to take you an hour to set up. You can set it up before you even go one, and just carry it on stage, plug it in, and your ready to go. In short terms BUY THIS LIGHT!",2
10439,"The tone output is great, but they go dull and start rusting within a couple of days even if I meticulously clean them after playing. Could be just the ocean near by but I gave up.",2

10448,"I got one these units as a Gift, cause I'm a Native American flute maker & Player, and at powwows I perform by telling stories and playing flutes, and this worked great if you was sitting right in the middle section. Well we had our own powwow coming up and no decent PA system, and they wanted to use mine for the drum arbor and DJ sounds. Well to take care of the sound for my right and left I modified the system by adding on each side of the cabinet 1/4"" speaker jacks coming off the internal speaker. Now my left & right speakers are two 10"" speakers in each cabinet, and with the power of this little unit our powwow was a big hit we had plenty of sound and this was all outdoors, and the people said they could believe that this little unit was supplying all that sound, so one other thing the wireless mic was no good it crapped out after just a few minutes, but I used Pyle wired mics anyway. I'm truly happy with the unit!!!!!!!!!",2
10449,"LOVE IT! Looks way more beautiful in person than on the photo. My only complaint is that there I some buzzing on the top 4 frets of the low E string, which sucks, but completely fixable if tampered with a bit. Can play literally anything on this guitar and it sounds great, from heavy metal to blues to classical. Highly recommend if you have a budget and still want a great guitar.",2

10454,"I love this guitar. I did some parlor guitar research, found these guys, liked their natural and handmade approach, looked online and boom found one for like $180, mint condition. It is AMAZING for living room practice, song sketching, or playing with friends, and maybe live but I haven't taken this one yet. Currently I am looking into getting a soundhole pickup, but it has a strap peg hole, so you could potentially electrify it that way with some internal magic. My other guitar is an electric ibanez dreadnought massive mofo, but I keep this one out and would like to gig with it. I'm a very large dude but prefer this. Hard to get too high up on the fretboard without a cutaway, but just don't do that. Intonation is great, resonance is great. Use light to medium strings, nothing to bright though. Great volume and sturdy build. Plus the look is perfect if you're going for the vintage feel.",2
10455,Great product !!! I have these on another Fender Strat work great. Have not installed these on my 2nd Strat. Will write again after installed.,2
10456,"I use these on my Martin Backpacker, because it requires extra light string and I can't seem to keep from breaking strings. I don't to go broke using premium coated strings if they're just going to break, so I stick with these guys.  They sound nice enough until one or two break, then it's time for a new set anyway. For a daily ""workhorse"" type of string, for a guy who just sits around on the porch strumming and picking little ditties, these are great strings. If you're doing gigs and playing live? maybe you want to upgrade, I don't know.  I happen to think that how you play the guitar matters a good deal more than what strings are on it.",2

10473,"I am changing my review of this pedal, this pedal makes my Les Paul Custom growl like no other pedal!
I also have a Boss DS-1 pedal, which is fine for an older pedal from the 70s, but it cannot make my Les Paul growl like the JF-16!
JF-16 adds even-order harmonics and attack which i have never heard from any other pedal!
I am playing my guitar through a Blues Junior, which is fine, but it is a very ""american"" sound.
This pedal makes my amp sound like playing a ""model"" of a Marshall Combo, which is exactly what I wanted!
Just to be specific, my pedal setup right now is: JF-16, Behringer RM600 Univibe Clone (which has its own distortion which adds awesome harmonics to the JF-16),
and lastly, NR300 Noise Reducer which keeps things (the JF-16 can be a bit noisy) quiet. At 34$ this pedal is a No-Brainer!!!",2

10475,"MXL V67G. This was the very first MXL condenser microphone that I ever bought. Since then I've added a bunch of affordable models from MXL's huge lineup.

If you've got about $100 to play with you can't go wrong with this microphone. If you aren't spending the $100 on another SM57 or an SM58, get the V67G instead. The sound quality is excellent, plus it looks alot like the famous AKG C12. Your friends will think you hit the lottery when they see this sexy looking microphone sparkling in your studio! Go ahead, do your research and check out the many positive reviews on the V67G microphone...it's all really good news.

MXL is a great company that provides a lot of bang for the buck with their products. They have a huge selection of models. I have  pairs of the MXL 2003A, 603s, 993, R40 ribbon, and 960 Tube mic (similar to V69me), I also own the MXL 4000 and yes, the V67G. I can recommend them all. MXL also back most of their products with an excellent 3 year warranty.

I worked in radio broadcasting for over 20 years and I've used the very best microphones available, costing thousands of dollars, Neumann U87's. (see my review for the U87 on amazon) The V67 uses a circuit design, similar to Neumann's, to reduce the brittleness and reduce the harshness of the microphones' K67 capsule.  I think that the V67 is quite impressive for the money!

Famous mic designers and mic modders really like the MXL products too... I think that most of their current models sound just fine as is. MXL is doing the neccesary QC. They have their own design team and build the microphones in their own factory, so many of their new ""stock"" versions are actually pre-modded. The MXL microphones are gaining in popularity with music industry insiders & recording artists. Grammy nominated (winning) engineers and producers are using them everyday on their own professional recordings......that my friends, speaks volumes.

Based on the many positive reviews I've read,  I'm looking forward  to  auditioning  and perhaps owning  the CR-89 & Genesis tube microphones when I can afford them.",2

10479,"This a 15 foot instrument cable for guitars and similar instruments to be hooked into an amplifier.

As such, what makes this cable different:?  This cable has a kill switch on one jack that allows you user to switch a guitar in the amp without hearing that electric pop.

From that aspect, this cable works really well.  You simply push the button and  everything is fine.  No pop is audible at all.  So from that aspect, this does what it states it will do. Plus, Planet Waves (by extension the D'Addario) makes very good quality products in my experience as well.

As to the cable, the components seem to be of a quality build and the cable works just fine.  No obvious issues or translation issues when using this in an amp.

Overall?:  This is a nice cable that works well with the kill switch.  IF you play and switch instruments, then this is a good cable. If you are simply a home player, this is still a nice choice for those moments when you switch on or switch instruments.  The sound seems very good, so the question is whether you need this and should pay the extra premium for it given you go the cheapie route and pay a lot less.",2

10489,Works as advertised and much easier to use than other stylus cleaners. Two Light taps and I am comfortable that my stylus is clean with no concern about causing any damage.,2
10490,Feels sturdy for lighter guitars. The screws could be longer though.,2
10491,"I really enjoy using these products to maintain my guitars.

The fretboard cleaner does a great job of dissolving all the crud that builds up there.
The fretboard conditioning oil gives it a nice healthy sheen, and doesn't leave an oily residue if used properly
I haven't noticed a huge difference with the string conditioner, but it smells nice.
The guitar finish cleaner does fine, but warm breath and a soft rag does fairly well too.
Be sure to shake the carnuba wax first, it separates and will come out the bottle like the liquid on the top of yogurt if you don't.

The polishing rags are nice and soft, but are not very durable, they will begin to unravel.
The fret polishing patch removes all the oxidation off the frets for better bending and ultra shine.

It's great for maintaining, but where this product would really shine is if you purchased an older used or floor demo.  Not only would it clean, but disinfect your instrument because who wants some stranger's sweat and boogers on their guitar, right?",2
10492,"This was a decent mouthpiece considering the price. I own it for soprano as well in size M7. I can honestly say I get a much better tone out of the soprano version than I do on the alto version of this mouthpiece. Though the sound is acceptable, it sounds very plastic which sticks out much more on alto/tenor than it does on soprano. It is also larger in the mouth (not as comfortable to play.) Though the tone quality produced is not as good, you can really hit altissimo notes like crazy with it. Being around 25 dollars this is an excellent starter choice for someone beginning to play a jazz mouthpiece. They are very, very different than classical mouthpieces. This gives someone the ability to try one out inexpensively and get the hang of it before purchasing a much more expensive one.",2
10493,"I've been playing around with harmonicas for a couple of years and only recently decided to get more serious.  I have been adding several harps to my collection, trying to settle on one that I really like.  Once I find that one I will get it in all of the keys that I need.  This harmonica was an early Father's Day present from one of my sons (thanks, Joe!)

This first thing that I noticed was the purity, almost bell-like quality of the sound without using the holes for the over-blow and over-draw feature.  The Overdrive has a beautiful black finish and feels smooth and comfortable in my mouth (unlike many other harps that have sharp, pointy edges.)  I have been using it in my lessons just as a straight harmonica without using the top and bottom holes.  However, when I am playing around I love that I can over-blow or over-draw with ease (it's also pretty easy to bend as well.)

The way that it works is that if you want an over-draw note on the 3 hole, you block the hole on the bottom of the cover-plate.  If the block the hole on the top on a blow note you will not get any sound at all.  Then if you want an over-draw note on the 3 hole you block the hole on the top of the cover-plate.  Sounds easy but it is taking some practice for me to do it without thinking too much about what I am trying to do.

Since I wear the extra-large size of gloves (not when I am playing, of course) you can be sure that my hands and fingers are far from thin and dainty (if you have seen any of my video reviews where you get a close up view of them you will agree.)  Yet I have no problem covering just the holes that I want to.  It will take some practice but I love that the Overdrive has this feature.  I couldn't be happier.",2
10494,awesome,2
10495,High quality strings that sound great!!,2
10496,Great tool to have in the kitchen. I would buy again.,2
10497,"I play in a blackened doom band and this is my favorite pedal so far. We had an issue with a cheaper fuzz pedal in the past where it was not polyphonic and trying to play anything more complex than a bar chord would just result in an ugly sounding noise with no audible notes. The Rat's distortion is smoother than that pedal, and can play any damn chord you want without getting messy. You can be heavy and pretty at the same time! I like the design, it is small and compact while uniquely shaped. However it does not fit your typical one spot or 9 volt adapter so it is the only pedal in my chain using a battery right now. The filter knob allows a lot of variety in your tone so I know i will be using it in my other bands and not just my doom one.",2
10498,good deal! thanks,2
10499,"I've been playing Metal since a youth. I am now 39. I grew up & therefore emulated: Mtley Cre, Ozzy, Pantera, Skid Row, Whitesnake, Poison, Warrant, Van Halen (not Van Hagar), Dokken, pretty much all the Shredders from Randy Rhoads to Dimebag Darrell. These strings bring something to the occasion. The bite, the attack, sustain, it's all there. Place them over some HOT pickups, and watch out! The durability is something to be spoken on as well. The Cobalts? Tried them, didn't like them. I do believe that the black winding at the bridge has something to do with this great sound. Worth the shekels.",2
