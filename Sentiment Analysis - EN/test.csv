0,"This is one of the worst reverb pedals I have ever tried. I've owned cheap, industry standard, and boutique reverb pedals, and this one has by far the shortest most subtle reverb effect I have ever  used. The max decay time/reverb length is like 2 seconds. This lands it firmly in ""subtle"" territory.  It's a shame because the quality of the sound is decent and the pedal is built well enough.",0
1,"I really like this at first.  The ability to operate each light independantly added flexibility over the reglar stand lights.  However, after less than 10 uses (maybe 12 hours of light), the bulbs on one side flicker so bad I can't use it.",0
2,"This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos.  I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.

When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me.",0
3,"It's OK. But if you try to raise the height, the top part comes right off the base. No matter how much you tighten it.  So you have to raise it from the pole. Also? Knows don't tighten well enough to keep it from tipping with heasy books",0
4,"Loved the reviews, just wish it would have worked when it arrived. Returned it, I may try once more.",0
5,"Worked GREAT for almost a year, but it has developed a clicking sound that I cannot eliminate. Is there any way I can get a replacement?",0
6,"eh, save yourself some money and don't buy this. rubber has no memory. what ever you clamp it to is now an impression.",0
7,Too little thickness. Less width than thin card stock.,0
8,"At first, I thought it would be OK, but I soon discovered that between getting harps in and out, and working with its limited adjustments, surely there was something better. After trying the Hohner Harmonica MZ 2010 Flex Rack, though overpriced, I realized that the HH01 was a waste of time and money. However, if, by chance, its geometry fits your anatomy, and you want to struggle with changing harps, or perhaps only use one harp, some electrical tape on the pinch bars to avoid damage to harps and improve traction might make this a real bargain.",0
9,"There is one low note that it did not work, I don't know when people returned the items , Amazon used those item to send the defective ones to the new buyer",0
10,It does what it says but sounded too artificial. I returned it for that reason alone. Sounded like Robots R us.,0
11,"I never had any issue with the D'Addario 9-42 set except that I find the low E string too loose on drop D or drop C# tuning. So, I tried the 9-46 set. It sounded great. So why the three-star? Manufacturing quality. The twist of the string at the ball-end of the high E string unraveled, on three sets. I have to buy Ernie Ball .009 singles, as replacement, because the other string on the guitar are practically new. I bought the 10-pack expecting the same quality from D'Addario. I'm terribly disappointed with this one. There was an old Amazon review on this with the same issue. It appears that D'Addario hasn't fixed it. Will they be fixing this? Is it time to move onto Ernie Ball? Ernie Ball makes quality strings, too. Maybe even better quality.",0
12,"One of the 4 wires I bought went out the same night of use. The second wire, doesn't lock onto microphone vut still works. I haven't even open the other two wires I bought. Price is great for the poor product I received.",0
13,It was crackly and very tight to the connector. It had no clean setting and went in and out connection wise.,0
14,"This pedal provides bass, mid and treble controls, something I needed because my Bugera 5w tube amp only has a generic tone control. In addition, it provides what is called a voicing control, which just gives you some more tonal options, and a gain boost. This is a very useful pedal for me. As to providing you with the tone of an Vox AC30 amp, I can't speak to that. I've never used an AC30.

Amended Review: I had to return the first pedal because it stopped working after a couple of months. But I liked the pedal so much, I received another. But this pedal has also quit working after just a few months, and it has not been used very much. I am extremely disappointed in Joyo's quality control and I cannot recommend their pedals.",0
15,Bought these to fit on my Epiphone LP and they did not fit and one of them came chipped. Poor quality.,0
16,I don't believe it's isolated ground...get really hot.  Took mine offline and replaced it with another brand.  Your results may differ.,0
17,Cheapest piece of plastic you could find to make these pins. Two pins broke while tuning...the strings were fine and not user error. They also would not hold strings securely (Elixir),0
18,"They're not bad picks, just not for me.  Too soft and ""round"" sounding and feeling.  I like a much stiffer pick with a sharp tip, and a much brighter sound.  I play mostly hard rock and metal, your mileage may vary.",0
19,"This clip is actually pretty strong, BUT it's to long for my taste, i thought i could hide it somehow to make it look as if my leather strap was actually atached to the guitar neck but it's too long for that. The good point is that it is solid, it holds very strong, you can pull from it and it dosen't clip off.",0
20,Not like the one in the picture.,0
21,"ITS GOOD FOR AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR BECAUSE THE FAUX LEATHER ENDS ARE SO THIN. I WONT PUT IT ON ANY OF MY BASS' I DONT THINK I COULD TAKE THE WEIGHT. SO I PUT IT ON MY ACOUSTIC GUITAR,TIED 1 END TO THE TUNING PEG AND 1 AT THE BOTTOM OF GUITAR. WORKS GREAT FOR THAT. BUT DEFFINETLY WOULD NOT HOLD WEIGHT FOR VERY LONG. JUST CHEAP,CHEAP,AND DID I SAY CHEAP MATERIAL!",0
22,"I had the same issue that others here have had. When its clamoed down tight, it has a tendency to get stuck.  Unscrewing the tension knob does not release the tension.  After i drag it off the neck sideways and fiddle with it it will generally release and appears to be fine until i try to use it again.  Go get the Schubb capo. It has adjustable tension and is simple and fast to release and move.  The Schubb is also made of steel rather than the cheap plastic this is made from.",0
23,"After the massive amount of fret work I had to perform on this neck, less alone the rebuilding of the headstock, there are much better bargains out there. Skip this Chinese low-class mistake.",0
24,"medium gloves too small, always get the large",0
25,Product wat too large for a 76-not keyboard. Do not buy this unless you want your keyboard bouncing around like pinball in a bag that could literally hold two of them.,0
26,"The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.

Luckily I bought the three pack.

But I can't recommend this product.",0
27,Not quite the sizzle sound of rivets. Dampens the wash.,0
28,was ok,0
29,"You cannot expect much for $43.00
I returned this microphone to Amazon for a return.  Will not buy a Behringer mic again.  I have a Beyer and MXL that is much crisper in the highs than this mic.  High frequencies is rough and lacking in clarity.",0
30,"While this board was not costly, the thin aluminum construction, coupled with the awkward half-hinge design makes this pedal board a pain to use.  The velcro system in place on this board is nowhere approaching good enough for a gig, and unless you've got several heavy pedals, this board is going all over the place just from regular use.  I went through the trouble of making permanent mounts for my pedals, which was a poor investment in time since the overall quality of the board was unsatisfactory to begin with.  Look elsewhere.",0
31,"I tried to use this to improve the sound with my Baggs M1 magnetic pickup on an acoustic guitar, and it went terribly. Even in the ""off"" position, the pedal introduces a lot of crackly overdriven sound whenever I just barely touch the guitar strings. The ""on"" position therefore has a bad baseline sound to deal with.

Separately, the controls that are available are too dumbed down. Except for ""level"", the exact effect of the other knobs is hard to understand. I would prefer the traditional controls on a compressor: threshold, amount, delay on attack, and delay after attack for it to stop doing anything. As well, this appears to want a very low signal in general, lower than what you get from an active guitar pickup; however, is it so strange to want the *option* to use this with an active pickup and higher signal?",0
32,This is hands down the cheapest POS case you will ever own.  There is absolutely no padding whatsoever.  I would not even put a Jay Turser in this case...,0
33,I have owned a few different pairs of these sticks in the past.  I thought I would change it up by using the red ones.  The red light is so dim you can barely see the glow.  I am going to stick to the BLUE ones!!,0
34,"Might work for extremely light weight microphones, but my application involved using it with a wireless mic and it could not keep it in an upright position.  the mic kept dropping down and resulting in several complaints. Will not be buying again or recommending to anyone.",0
35,Decent strings. Same thing as martin retro strings which are cheaper. Package was damaged pretty badly but strings were alright.,0
36,"I took a chance and bought because the description said it was compatible with most keyboards.  It did not work with mine... in fact, it did the opposite - not sustain, but shortened the tones and cut them off immediately - read other reviews that explained why this was and that many others had had similar issues, but still I was very disappointed.",0
37,"There ok, very stiff. I thought they would be a little softer and more flexible.
I made some of my own from a felt placemat, I made them bigger and from a softer felt. I like mine better. They produce a softer sound on my guitar. I don't have a ukelleli.",0
38,"the noble is not responsive compared to others brands , the mouthpiece area is uneven meaning the comb reedplate and cover seem to be very different from other harps , reedplates protude out and air leaks .  i've tried seydel before and un happy thought i would try again with all the good reviews ,  ordered a crossover and love it .  i sent the noble back and made my decision in about 2 minutes i could tell just not responsive enough at all . i play seydel blues session and it's not the slightly different hole size that bothers me  . i just received the crossover and love it . doesn't ever compare .  i don't understand all these positive reviews .",0
39,"I rarely give 1 star reviews but I'm going to here.

These strings are overprice, over-engineered, and over-hyped.  D'Addario make a better product.  I regret wasting the money on these things.  The tone is flat and the sustain is non-existent.  It's probably the the nanoweb coating causing the issue.  IMHO&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Addario-Nickel-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings-Light/dp/B019JD0ZNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D'Addario Nickel Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light</a>&nbsp;are a vastly superior product and I highly recommend everyone try them.",0
40,"For a really high quality looper around the same price, pass this one up, check out the TC Electronic Ditto x2. If you want a serious looper look to the Pigtronix Infinity.

Digitech stuff has no place in a pro's rig.....",0
41,Kind of top heavy,0
42,"First we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup.  It's less than ten bucks.

It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar.  As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole.  It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.

It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices.  Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4"" to 1/4"" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord).  You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.

It is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. If you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.

So because of the limitations I rate it as above.  For what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay.  I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes.  I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from.  But this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to.",0
43,They were dead in one hour.,0
44,"TC is very overrated.

Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion.  The vintage BBDs (MXR Vintage DElay, Morley 70's echo) for example just take it.  But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better.",0
45,Way too large and the tips are too pointy.,0
46,"Well unfortunately I am just another statistic...received mine today and the reverb does not work on it. Yay, now I have to return it! This item seemed to have been opened once before so I'm not sure I got a return item and maybe they never checked it before reselling it. I don't know but because if this, I won't be taking a second chance on another one and I am just returning it. It sounded ok.",0
47,"I'm giving two stars simply because the capo does what it's intended to do to an extent. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. Yes, it holds down the strings so you can play in a higher key. However, the design on this capo is awful and I can't recommend it.

First of all, it is not adjustable, and out of the box, the spring tension is way tighter than it needs to be to get the job done. You need a fairly strong grip to spread it wide enough to install it. Once you do, the tension is so tight, it pulls the strings slightly, causing some tuning issues. The tension is so tight, if you have a chunky neck, you're going to have issues placing it higher than around the fifth fret.

Secondly, when installed, the darned thing is an eye hazard. I don't like how the two prongs stick up.

Thirdly, the bar that comes in contact with the strings is very narrow and tapers even more narrow toward the high E string. My guess is that from a design standpoint, their thought was that the skinnier strings need less surface area to hold them down. I'm not sure that I agree. The fact that I experienced string pulling/tuning issues leads me to believe they were wrong.

You can get a better capo for the same or less money.",0
48,"I bought this trigger at amazon after reading only positive reviews.
first tested it if the trigger works, it seems to send a signal when I hit it with good force, but the sensitivity is worthless.
It doesn't trigger when I attached it to my snaredrum on the rim like it should, nothing, nada, niente.
No matter how hard I hit the snaredrum.

Worthless product, better buy Roland, apart from this, you can't detache it quickly to put on another drum.
You have to first unscrew it, which is not done very quick.
I'm pretty new to triggering acoustic drums, don't buy the cheap ones, better spend some more and buy something decent!

I won't buy DDdrum triggers again! Period",0
49,I wish I had never bought it. Don't get fooled in to it like I did. I never have been a Kyser man; should've stayed away from this purchase. It was late at night and it felt like a good idea at the time.,0
50,I have been repairing my guitars and other stringed instruments for years and this has to rank as the poorest quality part that I have ever purchased.  Seriously this is an absolute joke.  The machine work on these fingerboard guards is so rough that it almost appears to have been cut with a torch.  I was able to file the sharp edges of one of the guards so that it would not dig into the fretboard of the guitar  and bordered the guard itself with frog tape to prevent the metal edges of the guard from doing any damage to my project but the fret slot was so ragged that I eventually gave up on trying to salvage it.  Totally worthless as a repair or maintenance tool on any instrument that you might care about.,0
51,"Be aware that although this may work fine, it cannot be plugged into your powered USB hub along with other audio interfaces, and cannot play your DAW virtual instruments without jumping through some hoops.  The only way to monitor the MIDI instrument output through studio speakers is to have this device running through a separate MIDI interface.  It seems pointless to make a recording device with no monitoring outputs, with a recording rate of 16 bit/48khz, when the recent standard is minimally 24 bit/96khz, unless all you are doing is monitoring through computer speakers.  The resulting recorded audio is then also incompatible with a 96khz main session.

Since the only way to make a recording with this device is to have it firing an external MIDI instrument, if you want to record MIDI into your DAW it makes more sense to get the G2MV3.",0
52,I still get quite a bit of pop. Not impressed.,0
53,"EDIT: So, after using the product for a few more days, I've noticed that it's noisy. I kept hearing some extra buzzing and hissing that is not typically in my signal chain. When I put my finger on the metal parts of the cable, the noise went away. That means it's a grounding problem, caused by the cable. I swapped it for another cable, and the noise was gone. So I'm not sure if this one just developed a problem, or if it's an issue inherent in the design, but I'm revising my review to reflect the fact that, three days in, the cable is now unusable for me.

Good quality product that provides a solution that, in my experience, isn't much of a problem. Most guitar/bass players rarely change guitars in the middle of a performance. And of those that do, the vast majority have a tuner or volume pedal, etc, at the beginning of their chain that they use to kill their signal if they ever need to unplug. So I'm not sure this is a huge problem in the first place. That said, if it DOES sound like something you might need, it's a good solution. It's easy to use, and it works well. Innovative...IF you find yourself having the problem that this design solves. For me, not really an issue, but YMMV significantly.",0
54,"This is plastic, not bone.",0
55,Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use,0
56,"The quick-draw idea is great. Unfortunately, the sound isn't. The jingles are too thin. It sounds rattly and weak, doesn't have enough high-pitched ""clink"" to give definition. I'll be sending it back. The build quality is great and the minting system seems well-designed. It just doesn't sound good.",0
57,"poorly made, falls apart. not worth it.",0
58,"Bought in 2016, worked fine. Decent volume, somewhat lacking bass but still pretty good for what i used them for (music and games)

My issue just started happening, the little left/right selector switch on the back started cutting out one of the speakers for no reason. I've never even used the switch and i've never moved the speakers, moving the switch a few times will usually bring the sound back but it always ends up wiggling itself out again later.

Very annoying and cheap, almost unusable now",0
59,did not work at all. very dissappointing. tried every conceivable configuration to no avail. be very careful.had to send back.,0
60,"I may have received a bad one because the volume is no where near my expectations for a 100W rating amp tube or solid state either way.

But that is not why I give it two stars

Pros:  I liked the clean setting, was actually quite good and it felt good playing it. I think they did a great job on the feel of the amp on this channel for sure.  Better than most other SS amps I've tried, and I've tried many amps and live through a cabinet this is as good as some of the high end profiler ones for this one sound.  So if not for the weak volume that would have been quite nice and I was pleased with that.  Even the ""Solid State"" clean channels was pretty good to my ear.  Has good bass thump if desired (even with the volume issue I had) and reverb was good

Cons: All the gain channels were fizzy and boxy sounding.  The sound was very similar to another pedal board SS amp that I tried recently, just harsh sounding and couldn't dial that out.  The Modern channel was probably the best out of them, but these sounded just overall bad to me.

Again, I may have received a bad one and clearly there is a volume issue on mine, so take my review with a grain of salt",0
61,I Bought this item last week . got it yesterday used it for about 10 minutes and did not like the sound it gave. i returned it today not for me need a better sound .,0
62,"This device was mated with a stand. Upon receiving both items, the slop/wobble in assembling them together confirmed that this is not going to work. The MS7201B stand works great but it does not mate with this device. Using plumbers tape does not help this problem. Disappointed.",0
63,"You get what you pay for- sounds are weak, some delay effects cannot even be adjusted to sound better or more dynamic. For $65- it is still very average.",0
64,Well constructed heavy duty stand but it causes the guitar to lean back at an excessive angle. My Martin guitar fell out of it but fortunately no damage. I have other Hercules stands that I'm very satisfied with but this one went to the Goodwill.,0
65,Shiitty pick,0
66,"This thing works, but barely. I woudnt use it outside my home, as my amp fits, but not well. It is rated up to 100 lbs, so I figured my Blues Deluxe combo would fit perfectly. It doesn't at all, it slides down and it does not cradle the amp, very unstable. It works at home as I don't turn the amp up past 2. If I cranked it I believe that the vibrations would cause the amp to fall, negating the entire reason I bought it, for stage use. This is definitely made for very small combo/practice amps, my Vox AC4TV fits perfectly, but you could place that on a flimsy plastic table and it would be fine. POINTLESS",0
67,"I've had mine for a little over a year.  Received it Feb. 2016.  The top thumb screw just died.  Now I can't adjust the top screw.  The tablet just spins freely on top.

- The on/off switch is good for doing tremolo effects on your voice
- No big deal if you lose them, since they're cheaper than the beer at the bar

The bad:
- The grille is flimsy. I dropped one mic, and ended up with a huge dent.
- These clip/distort fairly easily, even with the mixer gain turned down. You can have a 0dB level on your mixer channel, and still hear distortion if the singer is powerful enough.

Overall, I'd buy again if I needed another carrying case for my better mics.",0
96,It was damaged when it arrived. The board inside broke loose and damaged the wiring shorting the terminals together. So when I plugged it in it shorted my amp out. Poor workmanship. The board was mounted with two screws instead of 4 and the corners on both sides broke loose and the board just hung from the wires during transit knocking around for many hours. It was a product of china. The Name MCM not custom audio was on the subwoofer and it is not mentioned in the description if so I never would have ordered it I have made that mistake once already. People need to be upfront about what they sell and then they will have a good business. Don't disguise your product with another name like Pro Audio when it is really MCM Custom audio. Just a lot of lost time and shipping charges. The vendor did offer a full refund and will pick up the product. They were sorry that the product destroyed my amp.,0

101,"2nd Update:
I just replaced the remaining DR Dragon Skins with a new set of D'Addarios, and *what* a difference.  The darkness that I originally heard is gone, the guitar sounds wonderful again.

You pay a premium for coated strings.  Thus far, they don't seem to be worth it to me.  Pay less, change more often is going to be my motto!

1st Update:
At about 8 weeks since I first put on these strings (and ~12 gigs, lots of practice), the high E broke during a performance.  That's not all bad, given that I bend strings a lot and switch between standard, open-D, and open-G a few times per show.  I slapped on a D'Addario replacement, which sounds better (brigher, newer) than the other DR strings.  That's not all bad either, except that the DRs cost more, and in theory, the coating helps them sound better for longer... but the DRs started out with a ""darker"" sound, so I think their sound has not changed much.

I can still feel and see the coating on all strings.  Unlike Elixirs, it hasn't started peeling anywhere.  A very small amount of coating is gone from where I pick the strings, at least on the unwound strings where I can see and feel the lack of coating.  But it's completely minor compared to the ""fuzz"" of a set of well-used Elixirs.

I never heard back from DR :-(

Insofar as keeping their tone, both these DRs and Elixirs seem about the same.  Given the DR's lack of peeling, I give the DRs the edge.  But 3 sets of D'Addario strings costs about the same.  I don't think the coating has anything to do with string breakage, so I continue to recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Addario-EJ16-3D/dp/B000OR2RNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D'Addario EJ16-3D</a>&nbsp;strings.

Original review:
""DRAGON SKIN the invisible coating"".  It says so right there on the front of the box.

Ha: The coating is absolutely visible, and you can feel it too.  It's lumpy.  So far, it doesn't seem to be an issue when actually playing.

That's just a first reaction, but enough to goad me into reviewing them.  Darn sure unexpected, hence my low rating.  I just emailed DR about this; maybe I got some bum strings.

But the proof is in the playing and the sound, right?  My fellow guitar player's very first comment on hearing them was ""they sound dark"".  To my ears, they sound better (and brighter) than the few-weeks-old strings they just replaced (D'Addarios).  If they sound dark to others, that's a Bad Thing; they're on a cedar-top guitar which is already dark enough, thank you very much.",0
102,"These aren't very loud, more like a children's toy than performance ready. I would go with the king clave.",0
103,"The 1st string was six inches too short to be able to put on my Guitar....a factory error, apparently. Too bad, because the 5 strings I did put on have a very nice, easy to play feel to them. Good sound, as well. But my electric guitar requires all six strings, so this purchase was basically useless to me. Not sure I would give this product a second chance.",0
104,Not very flexible. Knocks over easily.,0
105,"I wish I could report that this guy solved all of my ails with 60 cycle AC hum, but unfortunately it does, and it does not.

When engaged, it definitely kills the hum, but there are still a few transients that get past what it gates out. It turns loud AC hum into a light sparkle, for lack of a better way to put it.

That I could deal with, but what I can live with is the fact that it is NOT transparent in the signal chain. There's a definite loss of boost when engaged, and on top of that (and the most unfortunate) is when the gate closes there is a very harsh, electrical sound as the pedal engages. To describe it better - if you're playing something using a high gain amplifier, and you have a rhythm section that has a stop in it (where the guitar volume is still up, but you mute the strings) there's a definite sound as the pedal plays catch-up between the (""good"") noise generated by the guitar preamp and the pedal trying to lop off the ""bad"" noise. As another reviewer said, it definitely sounds similar to a cheap reverb.

If you're just jamming with friends and want to kill the AC noise when you're not playing, this will do the job. But unfortunately, anything you record using one of these inline is going to take a lot of editing to get it's noise out of the track - you're better off just filtering the AC hum instead.",0
106,Looks nice and is well made. But it's TOO LONG for most guitar/ bass players--- unless you play with a guitar at your knees. Literally can't get this short enough to use as a bass strap.,0
107,"OK, First off, I love JOYO... I think they produce very high quality pedals... the ultimate drive is one of my favorites and I think it's better than most overdrives and situations out there... A lot of people immediately , maybe even subconsciously believe that because they are so cheap, they are constructed poorly, or that the sound and build quality is bad... this is not the case... I can guarantee you that every JOYO product is made with the same quality as a 200 dlls stomp box... Same materials, same casings, same sound. There are comparison upon comparison videos out there pointing this out...
 I have 5 JOYO pedals and they are all built like a tank and I know they will last me forever... but back to this review of the US DREAM. I don't like it...
 I really thought I would like it since they say that the Surh Riot is a great distortion, hum, I don't think so... I have all kinds of pedals ranging from 300 dlls to 25 Dlls... the only other distortion box I own that is not a fuzz or an overdrive is the Way Huge Fat Sandwich and that is a truly great distortion... If you are on a budget, and want a quiet pedal, that can deliver super high gain, nice high and lows... and is super crunchy or smooth... I suggest you get the JOYO Ultimate Drive... That pedal can do the same thing than my Fat Sandwich, ... Literally.
 It just sounds amazing... the only reason I did not return the US DREAM is because they stopped production of it.. and maybe it will go up in price later on... But there is no room in my pedal board for the US DREAM, sorry to say it.. but it's the only JOYO product I did not enjoy... It's still great build and sound quality... just not my thing...

121,"I fell for the new toy. As with so many of the modern software makers out there, Akai has the same attitude about their offering - ""This is a stick-up! Test our crap for us for free, and give us your money too."" It is put upon the paying customer to figure out all the problems with the buggy, bat-crazy, upside-down, incomprehensible install job, that is thrust upon the digital musicians of this world. In my not so humble opinion, ridiculous FOOLS wrote this code.

THE JUNK:
The midi button controls don't align 1 through whatever pads to software. They light up randomly in the software.
The software assigning is deep, but it never saves a state of settings without some issue.
The pots on this are stiff, it would work for some things but mostly not. It gives an artificial sense of solid construction.
Switching the banks on the controller does not switch them in the DAW or MPC software.
The one time (yup - one) this thing read my Vst folder without crashing, it named them all wrong. suddenly drums were cross named with other instruments.
Every other time I tried to add Vst folders - the MPC crashed - even after hours of FAQ and videos and reading install notes and so on, hours of changes all lost and hopeless.
A warning would pop up with every restart stating that my audio card had changed - every time - and would I like to adjust my preferences. GAH! I only have ONE installed audio adapter and it was already selected, over, and over, and over.
There was a distinct delay beyond normal response times from the tap of a pad to the MPC seeing it, and most of the time the pad tapped would not be the pad used in the MPC software. GAH! No damit the bass drum! not the crash-GAH!
In the online forum (which in this case means: for them idiots we sold this to) what worked for one person did not work for me.
AND LASTLY THE BIGGY STUPID INTERFACE MASHUP:
I should not have to adjust MY ENTIRE OS DESKTOP INTERFACE TO MAKE THIS CARP WORK. Wide screen, text enlargement and drag and drop have been around for over 20 years, Akai must have missed the last two decades of advancements.

WHAT THE?:
People just keep on buying this garbage and calling it platinum. Why? I was mislead.
Why do we keep testing their junk and solving their problems for them after having paid for a working product? Are we all that desperate for a tappy thingy?

EULA JUNK: KIDDIES WILL BE BORED:
EULA anyone? Thanks to the supreme court of this great nation, These cretins can now require us to give away our rights as of the moment we use the software (if that's what you want to call this riddled-pockmarked and weeping-pile of broken code.) And so they can give out whatever they want, lie about it, and not have to face any repercussions.
For every one who finds out the hard way - ten new people fall for this package in the hopes of a great deal and a way into a simple control interface. Seemingly Akai can't manage a working product never mind one simple to use.

THERE IS GOOD AND THEN THERE IS ACTUAL GOODNESS:
It isn't good- none of this product is good.
Good, as a general rule - works.
Good, gets us motivated and firing on all cylinders. GOOD gets a bad man good, and a good woman bad. Good is not what this product is and if they come at me with fire and brimstone, I will shrug it off because: 1) I'm an Athiest, and so therefore 2) once someone makes a claim of something that cannot be supported by facts it is THEIR problem to PROVE the claim has merit. Oh... that's what I am doing with this rant.

THE TOUGH QUESTIONS MUST BE ASKED:
Is it that they have no respect for their customers? Oh my friends - I think it is worse than that. I think they have a true disdain for their customers. EVIDENCE FOR MY STANCE IS IN THE FORUM AND THE FAQ AND THE EULA.

OOPS:
This software is Akai's promise of entry level excellence with the actual delivery of, UH-OOPS- Ah shucks was that us?
 If you look at their add campaign, It's like a bad episode of Mad Men. They are quite serious about this terrible solution they have strung together, with the intent, and the ethics of the ""New Trumpians."" (My phrase - mine)

THE UNREAL:
 this stuff has been on the market for years and it is still useless for any serious creation - buttons and all.
I had no idea it was this bad until I purchased it. I thought, briefly, at a minimum, that crashing software at this level would be unheard of. Perhaps they should employ better coders - not crazies with a new plan of vendetta against the world because Steve Jobs died, and Kurzweil never made a great keyboard.

SO GOOD THEY DID IT AGAIN:
Weather it be MPC essentials or MPC 2.0, BROKEN IS BROKEN. Reasoning would find a normal business meeting that concludes: if it doesn't play well with newer systems, heck - with any system, without crazy high=jinx don't sell it to the group of people being relied on to better the bottom line.

BIGGEST PROBLEM:
 if I have to set up anything for hours just to get it to work (it never did wholly work), I lose money, intensity, and creativity. Is Akai going to pay me back for those losses? They don't have to according to their EULA. It is my fault for choosing their gear; for trusting them.
Oh and how about the time it took for me to find all of this out on my own? Do I get my time or money back? Nope. How about for reviewing this for free, to keep you all from getting your time, and money stolen?
Nope that was my choice so they are covered there too. I don't get paid to be a watch dog.

THE FINAL WORD:
The problem with abusing trust, is when people like me choose not to forget.
Haven't you heard? Memories are better than ever thanks to all of the research being done, smoke or no smoke. Records online never go away either - well they do, but I will keep putting them back. The notion of never, suddenly outlives the expected financial life span of a corporation. Well except too big to fail banks, and apparently car companies; oh yeah, and housing sales and ... well that's another set of rants.

148,"I pick with my index finger but can't seem to find a good pick that works for this. I was hopeful that these alaskan picks would work, but they don't for a couple of reasons. They don't stay snug on my finger, despite trying the different size options. The pick also doesn't strike the string very well. I tried shaving it down using nail clippers and a file, yet the pick then becomes too flimsy.

I think a couple of improvements to the design would help a lot. Some suggestions:

1) Get rid of the open gap on the part of the pick that goes over your finger. It doesn't offer a snug and secure fit on your finger and after a few strums it begins to move around and slip off. I think that lengthening the pick to cover more of the finger would help with this. I tried their smaller sized pick and it was too tight and cuts off circulation. Why not offer some sort of softer material for the part that goes over the finger (velcro perhaps)?

2) The plastic is very thin. When I tried cutting a couple of the picks down, they became too flimsy and were useless. I'm guessing they used thin plastic so that they can be cut down, and so they can be more flexible for different sized fingers. Instead, they should offer more sizes to compensate. Maybe offer more sizes and ask customers to measure finger size so there is less confusing with sizing.

3) The open gaps on the top of the picks don't seem to offer much benefit. Not having them would allow the picks to be cut down to desired length without ending up with a flimsy 2mm end.

4) I wish there was a way so that the angle of the part that hits the strings was contoured so that it accommodates up and down picking. Since most people's picking hand is not perfectly perpendicular to the strings, it seems if they could change the angle of the end of the pick, it would help tremendously. I find this pick and others that are similar don't allow for clean and quick picking. When I strum, it sounds horrible and catches the strings especially on the upstrokes. The rounded angle just doesn't work well. Maybe having the pick end angled and more pointed would help with this.

5) The design is apparently intended for the finger nail to be placed over the top of the end of the pick. I find this very odd and quite uncomfortable. I'm guessing this is suppose to help with stability of the pick, though it doesn't seem to even do that.

6) The pick seems to extend too far from the finger, making it difficult to feel where you're picking. It seems if the end of the pick was barely sticking past your finger, it would help with this. As mentioned, trimming the pick down isn't really possible with the holes in the top.

Hopefully someone will create an index finger pick for strumming that meets these requirements. I'm surprised there is nothing yet on the market for effective index finger strumming. Yes, I'm aware of thumb picks, but they don't serve the same purpose. Metal picks are way too loud and share many of the complaints mentioned above.

Unfortunately, too many product sellers don't listen much to customer feedback, or even respond to comments, so I'm not holding my breath. But if you do read this, please take these considerations into future consideration of possible upgrades to your picks. I think you'll have a winner if so. Thank you.",0

156,"I own a couple of these, and a couple N/D767s, and have purchased & use many EV speakers, over the years. I've always liked EV products, but the 967, & EV, have disappointed me greatly. I did get about five years of occasional use, but I have much older mics that just keep working.

I take excellent care of all my equipment, and this is the first mic I've owned that just stopped working. It may have fallen to the floor one time, not from the stand, but from a table a few feet off a carpeted stage, but I guess that was all it took. Cause I went to use it the next night, and nothing, no sound at all.

A friend who does some electronic work opened it up but said the problem must be deeper into it than he wanted to go. I tried contacting EV, on two separate occasions to see how much it might cost if they repaired it, but they never even responded... I'm used to companies standing behind their products, so this was unexpected, and quite disappointing.

I'll probably have to just toss it, as a repair place would probably charge nearly what's it's worth, just to fix it; and who knows how much longer it would last, anyway? Therefore, I can't really recommend this mic, as I won't be buying another from EV...",0

Not sure you should buy this, unless you are a collector, but if you are, keep in mind that it will likely not appreciate.  Not recommended, as you can do far better with other models and purchasing options.  As I told someone else, it may be worth $75 tomorrow, it may be worth $1750 later, depending upon demand, but think about it.  They are upgrading these every so often, so it's like buying Pro Tools 7 when you can get Pro Tools 12.  Or Photoshop 1 when you can get PS7.  Or, a guy like Donald Trump, when you can get a Hillary Clinton...whoa.  Well, I mean the ""experience"" factor...but you catch my drift.  Why buy one beer when you can buy a six pack?  Why buy this when you can get anything else?  And, not to mention the lack of support.  The company will not be manufacturing these, from here, so you know what that means.  Why buy an Apple MacBook Pro from 2008 when you can't get support for it in 2011?  Why buy an iPod in 2010 when you can't use it, it won't work, and you can't easily service it in 2015?  Why buy an album by Tiffany or Debbie Gibson in 1987 when you know you won't ever listen to it in 1997 or beyond, and if you do, you know you'll be an outcast?  Come on.  I should give this one star, but the effects are actually pretty decent.

It's basically a more expensive of a plug-in bundle in 2016.  Today's guitarists are doing so much more with their laptops, onstage, that there's no need to get excited over this - and, trust me, those guitarists backstage that you can't see who are playing alongside the band are actually the ones making the magic happen.

181,"This is a review of the ""New Improved"" design. I have another one of these that I have used for a few years.

The previous design was 2 parts. The single pouch that fits up near the head of the guitar and a two-part pouch (like saddle bags) which held a humidity pack in each pouch side. The saddle bags then draped over the strings and hung inside the sound hole. The image used for the sale item shows the older, saddle bag design.

The new (not) improved design still has the single pouch for the head which is still made of the same material. The saddle bag design is now made of a more rubberized material with only a single pouch. Both of the humidity packs have to be crammed into this smaller space. The single opening is then draped over a plastic dowel. The dowel then has to be forced into a plastic clamp which is then rested on the strings while the pouch dangles inside the sound hole. The pocket of the pouch is so full of humidity packs that you have to force the strings apart to slip it through them. Not only does the hard plastic of these new pieces seem to risk the wood of the guitar, the nature of the plastic is destined to fatigue and fail with more use.

I would recommend you seek out the previous design instead of this ""new"" one. It seems to be easier to use, less likely to damage your guitar, and like it will last longer.",0
182,Disappointed. The top doesn't close properly without having to twist it with force. The internal compartment door is loose and hardly attached. There's quite a bit of glue smeared on the fabric inside the guitar. It's better than nothing but I won't buy another Gator case.,0

192,"I got this because it was supposed to be a simple and easy to use drum machine/sampler. It is far from that. Let's start with how it is impossible to load your own samples. I have tried several programs, because KORG doesn't provide any method to transfer samples, and nothing is working. I tried both on my PC and my phone (Samsung Galaxy 6) to no avail. I spent over 5 hours reading forums, watching the few videos on Youtube, and going through all the FAQ sections. NOTHING WORKS!!!!! The factory sounds are utter garbage.
It doesn't come with any power source outside of 6 AA batteries. They are supposed to last 10 hours. But if you start adding up the cost of batteries it is going to get expensive real fast. I can go through a set in two days easy. That's somewhere like 30 bucks a week to play without the plug (sold separately).
Outside of it not functioning as described or advertised the thing is very tiny. I knew it was small, but it is ridiculously tiny. The knobs are less then a pencil thickness. It makes it hard to really manipulate them for live jamming.
It does have a sleek and clean design to it, but it lacks a lot in the functionality.
I would suggest that you think twice about buying this item. It does not function as advertised and is not so easy to use like they make it look. I got it for a simple drum machine and a sampler player for loops and my own guitar chords, but it won't even transfer samples to the device in the first place, which makes it nothing more than a brick.
It only has 4MB of space too. I could only fit about 6 loops I made at less than 3 seconds each. That is so tiny it's laughable.
Do yourself a favor and save up for a better sampler or get an older Electribe MK II for about $100. A much better machine in function, design, and ease of use. Korg should be ashamed for putting out a machine that is so poorly executed. I am giving it one more shot before I request a refund and send this item back. It is not worth the time or frustration.",0

I wouldn't care if they felt like they'd fall apart in my hands if they at least sounded alright but they don't and if your music is hard to listen to these cables definitely play a part.

202,"I bought it expecting it to function like any delay pedal of this style to function, and it does not do that.

The Pro's first.
-Thankfully the Bypass works great

- The construction. It's the typical Behringer construction and I have no issues with. It's plastic yes, but as long as you're not waffle stomping the pedals.throwing them around, or other such intentional damage, it's going to last just fine. No issues there. I have a Boss BCB-60 (Enclosed board with a lid) that I take places multiple times a week and there's no damage to any of my pedals including a Behringer that I've had for 9 months now.

The Con's
- The Repeat Rate function: I have 3 other delays from different companies and for the ""rate or time"" function they're all the same. The further to the right you turn the more time or space you have between repeats. That's not the case here, and the worst part is that when you have it on the longest delay time, it's still really quick and when you have the rate at 12 o'clock or further to the right, all you get is hissing feedback. The rate alone makes this pedal non-usable. I also wish it was labeled as ""time"" instead of rate. It's really really bad.

- The Echo function. It does as it should but I wish it was labeled ""level"" instead of echo. I had to watch a few different tutorials to find out what the controls actually did.

- The Intensity function is actually the ""rate"" function or how many times it repeats. I wish it was labeled as ""Rate"" instead of intensity. Intensity makes me think it's the ""level"" function when it's not.

- FEED BACK and HISSING. When the pedal was on in my chain that's the most noticeable thing about it was that there was a really bad high pitched hissing when the controls were turned up to around half way, thankfully the bypass works. The hiss grew in intensity and I never had that going for more than a couple seconds before turning the pedal off. If you don't turn it off quickly, you could easily blow a speaker, or your ear drums.

Conclusion: Pass thing by. I cannot say that or emphasize that enough. PASS THIS THING UP! It's not that it's a Behringer and Behringer is bad or anything like that, I have couple other Behringer's that are just fantastic. The problem comes with the confusing labeling. The time, or rate being way to fast on its slowest settings and it's hissing and feedback issues. I bought this pedal to replace a really cheap delay that's a pile of garbage because it doesn't really delay, but now all I can say is that the pile of garbage is on the board and this one is going to be going into the garbage.",0

211,"The first thing to understand about a device like this is that it should last for a very long time. There's nothing in it that should just sputter out and stop working. Sure, you could ruin a pot, knob, dial, or jack, but barring one of those things happening, it shouldn't just stop working. It's a solid-state circuit board and it sits on a desk in a pretty beastly housing. At 25 months, mine died. I can count the times it has been moved around without taking off my shoes. It has been cared for well, never abused, and used in a non-smoking environment. Minus a star. At about 760 days of ownership, this little devil cost about $0.30 a day to own. By itself, that's not a terrible number, but given that I've got music equipment I've gigged with, hauled all over the place, and abused to no end that's been running for a decade or more, I'm pretty upset with it.

Native Instruments (who have aggressively bad customer service) offered to replace it with a refurbished product sometime in the next three to six weeks if I paid them $170. Sorry guys, that's an AWFUL deal. It also took seven business days of going back and forth with their technical support team, answering the same questions repeatedly, explaining that I had tried their ludicrous troubleshooting steps (they wanted me to try it on two Mac AND a Windows computer before ascertaining that it had a problem) to reach that laughably bad solution.

When I got it new, the direct monitoring (which is hardware level) didn't work. It still doesn't work, but I wasn't too fussed, and that represented well less than <1% of my need, so whatever. But, regardless of my needs, minus one star for a totally defunct hardware level feature right out of the box. Issue number two: the S/PDIF input never worked. I didn't even learn this until a full year after I'd bought it, but as far as I know it was also dead when I got it. Minus another star.

But how is it? Well, it's pretty good. The preamps are good enough for the price tag. It's clear, and you don't hear its internal electronics ever. The headphone jack on mine wasn't great, and I'd frequently hear a little noise when adjusting the volume, but that's not a huge deal. The drivers are solid, though Native Instruments' update system / software is some of the worst I have EVER used.

All in all, when it works, it's not bad. But, mine came with two DOA components, a headphone jack that crackled when adjusted, and it died in just over two years, costing me about $9 a month to own. I couldn't recommend it, and I wouldn't buy it again.

By way of a footnote, I also had a Native Instruments Maschine for a while, and I had hardware problems with it as well. Native Instruments does some great software work, and their hardware does feel wonderful when you're using it, but they just don't seem to have the kind of quality control you'd expect for the prices they charge.",0

How can you not appreciate that SG body, and I've always preferred humbuckers to P or J pickups.  I thought I had found my hearts desire when I picked this up and began to play (classic rock & blues covers for reference) and then my heart broke.  The sound was lousy.  Of course I tried a different EB bass and different amps but the situation never improved.  Despite my sincerest wishes I can't recommend this excellent looking bass to anyone (unless they're looking for wall art or are willing to switch out the pickups).

Knobs feel great.
My problem was that the drivers didn't allow to route different outputs.

 But then I want to plug in my powered 150W 8"" sub. So I tried RCA on the 3 output, and also jack output on the 3 output, but nowhere in the drivers did it allow me to route the main source ( let's say youtube ) to also come out on the OUTPUT 3. Unless I'm using a DAW, I can't route the main signal to any other output, it will only go to the Main Outputs.

The interface I currently have is an M-Audio Profire 610 and the drivers allow me to route the master signal to ALL outputs.

Lots of people had the same problem of sudden shut down of this mic. It has great noise cancellation, although you need pop filter. Nothing of this matter, when it stops working. Don't buy it. You WILL throw your money away.

PS. I think, I might found the reason why mic circuit burns down. When you connect it with USB, Windows assigns output speakers through this microphone. For Win 7 you have to click at speaker Icon (Right down corner of screen), click ""Mixer"", then ""System Sounds"", then click tab ""Playback"" and check if Speakers are not assigned to ""3-Samson GoMic"" by default. If you see green check mark on this Mic, your sound will go through this Samsom Mic. I think this is the reason why it stoped working. Set up other ""Speakers Audio device"" as default for playback from the same list where Samson Mic, by clicking mouse right button at another device and clicking at ""Default"" (in sub-menu). This will bring your sound back and should save your Samson Mic from overloading and ""burning"".
As soon as I found out about this I bought another Samson Mic. It still works. Just make sure every time when you connect Samson that your playback does not go through this Mic. Same thing does Skype. It reassigns audio playback to Samson and you have to switch back in Skype Audio Properties to your audio card playback device, otherwise you won't have sound.",0

My guitar is fairly bright so these sound great on it.  The only issue is they do not last long at all.  Ive only been using them for about a month and Im about to put my third set on.  On the first the high E string snapped in about 4 days.  On the second set the G string broke after 2 weeks.  I wouldnt rely on these for any gigging you might do.  There is most definitely a large loss of durability in exchange for comfort.  You have to decide if thats worth it to you.,0

This Samson Go mic pics up excessive amounts of white noise which is VERY audible upon listening to the recording.  This doesn't occur with professional microphones.

275,"Recently sampled these thanks to a local promotional event. Glad I was able to try them without spending $12 a set. To cut through the hype, these strings have a heavier core than standard electric guitar strings, so a set of 9's feel more like a standard set of 10's, and a set of 10's feels closer to a set of 11's. Players who prefer heavier strings will welcome the additional mass. With drop-tunings more popular than ever, that helps explain the high ratings these strings seem to get. Yes, they're different, but in my opinion, they're not necessarily better. If these strings were normally priced I would probably rate them 3 or 4 stars. Since they cost 4 times as much as regular strings, and some of their claims seem more like wishful thinking than reality, I'm dinging them a couple stars to help cut through the hype.  Not bad strings, but they're not great, and they're not for everyone.",0

I used these in my first clarinet and my professor told me not to use them in the fine instrument I later purchased because gouging the bore is a horrible thing, not covered by product warranty.  Also, if you leave them in the instrument after you have swabbed, the germs and humidity will ruin the bore of a wood clarinet over time.  (It won't do much good for a composite clarinet either.)  Buy a Vandoren microfiber swab or the expensive one made by the Doctor (or both) so you always have a dry swab in the case.  Look down the bore of a wood clarinet to make sure it is not in need of treatment!  It should shine, but not be oily looking.  Good care makes a clarinet easier to play, avoids excessive repairs, and helps it keep its value.",0
278,"Worked for 1 day, power supply fried the module on the second day.",0
279,"First, let me explain where I'm coming from.

I had a 2006 Epiphone Les Paul that I liked, but it sounded a little muddy. I decided to switch out the pickups for Seymour Duncans - boom! Magic! I think switched out the wire - boom! More magic! Then, I decided I wanted a vibrato (aka tremolo) system on my guitar, so I got the Stetsbar bridge and was happy; it even held tune okay. However, I decided I wanted to get tuners that would REALLY hold it in tune, and I was intrigued by the Planet Waves Auto Trim locking tuners. Big mistake.

I know that no hardware is going to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so bear in mind that I'm comparing these tuners to the stock Grover tuners my Epiphone came with.

Two main problems with the Planet Waves tuners:

#1. Strings are breaking all the time! I never had this problem before, even when I installed the whammy system. I'm finding myself going through a different high E string every day - and I play in flat tuning, so it should be reduced string tension. The B string is also a common casualty.

#2. These tuners can't hold tune. The problem is most noticeable on low E, but is also an issue everywhere else. If I start a song perfectly in tune after using a chromatic tuner, I find three minutes later that power chords sound awful because low E is flat. I've tried tightening the gears - I've even used a wrench - but there's nothing I can do to prevent slipping.

I get the impression that these tuners were designed specifically for standard and heavy strings. I like light strings, though, and it looks like these tuners simply can't handles 8s and 9s the way they should.

Again, I know all tuners will eventually slip a little and you need to retune from time to time. With the stock Grover tuners that my Epiphone came with, though, I was only having to tune my guitar once or twice a week. After two months, I just gave up and replaced the Planet Waves tuners with the old Grover ones.",0

It almost feels like the strings are cutting into my pick, but I think its actually the coating sticking or somehow dragging on my pick.  I'm going to take them off and put on some non coated strings.  They sound fine, but I don't think they sound as airy as non coated.  IMHO.

I would recommend one with a bigger on button, on it's front, and different color button than rest of tuner. Don't waste your time on this one. I'm returning mine today.

After spending this much $ on 4 strings, I did not expect this.  I was disappointed but was too lazy to return items to amazon (it is a pain) and needed new strings.  After putting them up, they sounded just like the 7 months old generic strings that came with my cheap $200 Bunnuel violin from amazon.  I have been practicing for 3-4 months and have no teacher.  So it thought the bad sound had nothing to do with the strings and was a matter of better rosin.  I bought some really exotic mix of Original Dark Hill and Sons plus Kolstein bass rosin (suggested by my fave online teacher Joy Lee on youtube) and that really improved the sound.  But now after a month, even the fancy rosin is not helping the terrible sound.  It is screechy as heck.  Did I do something wrong?",0
296,"I built a partscaster.  When I got these string guides, I was very disappointed.  If you look close at the picture, you can see what appears to be some roughness along the sides of the part.

I only planned on using one of them anyway, so I moved ahead with the other one.
That other one had a good enough finish...but the spindle upon which the strings rest wasn't centered!  So, imagine you've got this mounted exactly half way between your E and B strings, but the depression where the strings rest is right up against the side of the guide on one side, and 3/16"" away from the side on the other side!  I at first thought this one was trash, too, until I noticed that the spindle is actually a separate piece pressed into a hole in the main body.  I was able to push that pin back to the center using my vice and a pair of vice-grips.  It wasn't easy, though, because I had to pad the whole thing with leather strips to keep from messing up the chrome plating.  I got it to work, but I'd never buy them again...or if I did, I'd by several pairs, hoping that I'd come up with a couple usable ones out of the bunch.",0

300,"I've bought three of these so far, They're about the best I've seen but the assembly and quality control is absolutely horrible.  Someone, somewhere along the way is using USED parts and putting things together in a rush. One stand (from another amazon store) was sent to me not even in a box and had deep set scores in the boom straight down to the metal with the whole stand covered in smelly armor all. I sent that one back. Anyhow,  I've had to rebuild each stand I've purchased so that the adjustment points stay tight.  It's in the bolt assembly that the double knurled collar nuts thread onto, they aren't seating them completely into the tubes, resulting in the inability to tighten them or keep them tight.  To fix this I removed the set screw that holds the big threaded shaft onto the smaller threaded shaft and tightened the big threaded shaft ALL the way down onto the tube, reset the set screw and tightened things back up.  This way the shaft does not have left/right stress when hand tightening your stand - THIS is what loosens things up.

regardless, now it works.  they should send me a free stand for diagnosing and a posting a fix to THEIR problems.

373,"I recently bought this tuner to replace a Snark that I had owned for about a year on which the swivel joint broke. I thought I'd get something with a more solid mechanism, figuring that the tuner itself would be more or less the same. I was wrong. Although it seems like the Fender tuner would be less likely to break than the Snark tuner, when clipped onto my guitar, I could only look at the display on it sideways. Further, the readout was way slower and choppier than the Snark and seemed considerably less precise. Plus there's another annoying feature that changes the tuner to different settings for different instruments (because apparently an A isn't the same on a ukelele as it is on a guitar?!). Another fun fact: make sure you have a small philips screwdriver handy to put in the battery when you first get it and be very careful not to lose the tiny screw that holds the cover in place, which I almost did.

Long story short, I did end up returning this tuner and bought another Snark SN2 -- a far superior tuner for the price, even with the tendency of the swivel mechanism to break eventually -- only to find out that Amazon charged me more to return it than I had paid for the item in the first place. Clearly, buying this tuner (from Amazon) was a huge mistake.",0

The guys at GC tried really hard to get me to buy the Scarlett for only $50 more (they said it TOTALLY blew away the Audiobox)...but it was one of those occasions when I literally ONLY had $100 to spend...and it was only for a temporary (hopefully) fix of my system.

I use Slinky guitar strings on all my guitars and with the exception of one bad string about a year ago (my low E broke while installing the string, Ernie Ball sent me a replacement) I haven't had any problems, but I would avoid these bass strings like the plague.

Thank goodness Amazon pays the return shipping for defective items.",0
383,"Let me start off by saying 2 things...

One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...

Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two ""go to"" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the ""decent price"" genre...)

Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)

To the point.....

I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...

Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....

Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny ""fine hair"" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...

Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)

Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....

I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the ""incident"")

As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...

Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...

Worst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)

387,"I tried to put these on last week, as soon as I put some tension on them trying to get them in tune, the low E strings wraps seperated and the string came out of my FR bridge. So I cut it, inserted it again, tightened it down with ease, thinking maybe I went to tight the first time. Same result, the wraps on the string seperated again. So I then pull the string out, and reverse it by cutting off the ball, I then insert the heavily wound end that was next to the ball and it works finally. They have a good tone to them, but I think the Stainless Steel are better. Anyway, fast forward to a week later. I'm setting at my computer playing some new stuff I had written, and I hear a pop, and everything is out of tune. The A string seperated and popped out of its position in my FR. Now I know everyone is going to say I need to replace the knifes in my FR, but I bought this guitar new 6 months ago, and have never had this problem until this set of strings. Whats worse, is I was going to flip the A string around like I did the E, but as I unwrapped it from the tuning key, it broke, which could be typical for any string I suppose. These things seem so brittle its not funny. Maybe I got a bad set, maybe you shouldn't use them on FR bridges, who knows. I know I'll go back to the stainless. I love Ernie Ball strings, but things were awful.",0

396,"A contender for ""worst tuner of the year"" award except for one thing:  they can be modified.  That makes the price interesting.  If not for that these would be a total loss.

THE PROBLEM:  The ""locking"" mechanism on these tuners isn't.  It doesn't actually lock the shaft.  Instead it simply screws a shaft up against the strings to keep them from coming out of the holes.  It's basically a string holder.

HOW TO MODIFY THESE TO ACTUALLY WORK:
Modifying these is a two-step process:
1.  Unscrew the locking mechanism and cut / file off the tip so it can't reach the strings.  This will allow you to take the second step to make this an actual locking tuner.
2.  Fortunately for this design, the inside of the screw cap is hollow.  Thus a tiny o-ring, rubber washer or even locking nut can be put in there.  That inserted item will, once tightened, push up against the nut which is attached to the gear mechanism and prevent that nut from turning.  Thus you will have an actual locking tuner, for quite a bit less money than $50+.

POORLY MANUFACTURED
In addition to the ""doesn't really lock the gear"" problem, the threading in the clamp bushing (which clamps the tuning key to the guitar head) doesn't fit well to the internal threads, requiring oil and a socket wrench to get them in place.  That's inexcusably poor manufacturing.  How hard a process can it be to mill a proper screw thread and bushing?  That's why I give this 2 stars instead of 3-- because not only does it not function without modification-- it's poorly made.

This set would really be useless if not for the mod mentioned above.  Regular tuners would work better.

One thing I do like about this set is that the nut inside the shaft when you remove the locking head can be tightened or loosened, providing you exactly the right amount of drag on the keys themselves.  But that's not much of a saving grace.

The modification can be done in about 10 minutes once you see how it's put together.  So for a relatively low price, using some oil and a socket wrench to install these-- then adding a rubber or locking washer to the inside of the locking heads, you can have an inexpensive and functional locking mechanism.

I've searched the market and there doesn't seem to be anything between this particular model and $50+ good locking keys. Below that this seems to be the only model on the market, sold by dozens of sellers under different guise. So... if you want to spend as little as possible and still have a functional locking tuner... the above modifications will provide just that.

The only reason I give it 2 stars rather than 1 is because those modifications are possible.  Otherwise they would literally be the worst tuning keys I've ever used.  Once modified, they're ""okay"".  Locking tuners for $16 a set.  But let the buyer beware: the modification process is absolutely necessary to get these to work.",0

At $150-$175 this unit would be well worth it, but at $300, I'd like to see a more robust stand mount, slightly larger surface area and a better counter balanced approach to rigging.  First the sound... I use the Reflexion in my small project studio to help isolate soloists, mostly horns, on small combo jazz tracks.  I don't have a soundproof vocal booth - just a 13' x 25' open studio with moveable acoustic partitions for isolation. Typically, we record live jazz performances and run the upright bass, electric piano or guitars direct, plus a second channel for each instrument that's mic'd. Since drums are played in the same room, there was a problem with too much bleed into the sax or trumpet players mic. Vocals, of course,  were even more problematic. By using the Reflexion, I'm able to get much better isolation and clean up the tracks for superior control during mixdown. However, I find that one must also place a acoustic foam baffle behind the soloist to block reflected sound from behind the player/vocalist - the SE parabola just doesn't knock it down far enough by itself.  In a relatively small space, the Reflexion doesn't block drum set sounds sufficiently, unless you surround the kit with additional foam barriers and/or plexiglass shields... then the SE Electronics Reflexion can get you in the ball park for ambient control, and will slightly improve isolation on ""softer"" vocal tracks.
It actually works better on stage, where the small parabolic surface doesn't visually interfere with the musicians eye contact with other players and the audience as much as other devices would. Horn players don't object to blowing into one of these units and it will surely improve live recordings in this situation.
Finally, the ""C clamp"" mounting doesn't hold the filter, rigging and most studio condenser mics that well - the unit tends to tilt and sag.  More importantly, it is not a well-balanced device and that requires you mount it on a heavyweight mic stand, or use sand bags at the base to prevent having the whole rig and an expensive mic crash to the floor... use caution.

FOLLOW-UP The more I use this device, the more I dislike the mounting arrangement. It only gets looser and less secure the longer you own it... took it from three stars (it works fine) down to two because of the poor mounting clamps and top heavy design.",0
408,Not sturdy enough..,0
409,"The first one I received had cracks at the nut and at the neck joint.  The replacement I received had no cracks but did have gold over spray on the fret board.  Also, the fret ends were so sharp and protruding that it was uncomfortable to play.  I opted to return it for a refund.  I've since tried several others in-person at a couple different music stores and found they all suffered the same issues with sharp fret ends.  Until Gibson gets their stuff together, I'll buy used or buy another brand that has better finishing techniques and quality control.",0
410,"These really are not worth the money. They are bright but it doesnt have any speed adjustment even though the seller tried to tell me it does. They told me it adjusts it a little , I might not be able to notice. What the knob does do is adjust the sensitivity of the mic for sound active mode. This actually allowed it to be adjusted so that it worked really well with extremely loud music or really low music, at least for a little while. Then it started getting stuck. I don't know what else to call it. It just stops blinking and stays on for a few seconds and starts blinking again. It doesthis in regular or sound mode. To me a strobe light without speed control is useless and when it gets stuck on in sound mode it really screws up the effect of it flashing to the bass. Not worth the trouble to box it back up and print a label so I will toss it out and avoid this brand in the future.",0

415,"I became a Dampit user when I bought my first Taylor guitar, mainly because that's what Taylor recommends. I live in the high desert in Southern California, and my problem was that I had to soak the Dampits almost daily because they dried out so quickly. Since my wife and I had a longer vacation planned, I had to come up with something else. After a little research, I bought an Arion. I filled it with water and waited for the gel to absorb the water; then I put it into the guitar case with my guitar. After three days, I found it wasn't raising the humidity at all. I went back to my Dampits but left the Arion in the case. A couple of weeks later, I noticed the water level in the Arion had gone down slightly, so I took the Dampits out and monitored humidity again. With 25% room humidity, a single Arion is now keeping the guitar case at 40 - 45%. I've re-filled it once already, and it's still going strong. I guess they take a while to start working, because I just bought a new Arion for my other guitar and I'm experiencing the same thing. I'm kind of wondering about the 5 star reviews which implied the Arion maintained humidity from day one. Is this really the case, or did more people experience the delay before the Arion started working? If it wasn't for the delay, I would have given it 5 stars.

-------------

After more than six months of using the Arion humidifier I'm ready for something else. I downgraded my rating to two stars because it seems every time I refill the Arions, it takes a week or two for them to start working again. Again, once they start working they work well, but it's that week or two after a refill that I'm concerned about. They won't even raise the humidity in a sealed zip-lock bag during that two week period.

-------------

I moved on to the OASIS OH-14 (blue) humidifier and am really satisfied. One humidifier in each of my guitar cases maintains the humidity between 42 and 48%. Works much better than the Arion.",0
416,"Basically just sounds like a little 59 but with the hum. It sounds like humbucker and it doesn't have the Tele twang, which I guess is good if you're looking to change that. In my opinion, if you want this sound just get the little 59 because you'll get that thick sound without the hum.",0
417,"Not blue as pictured, charcoal in color, don't buy!!",0
418,"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.

I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.

I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maple/dp/B000GAN010/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maple</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosewood/dp/B000GACXA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosewood</a>&nbsp;neck).

[Update November 15, 2013]
I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!
I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!",0

444,"This feels like one of those products that someone designed, but never bothered to actually use. It looks and feels like a rawhide boot lace. Very stiff and hard. I applied some leather conditioner and tried working it in by hand, thinking it would be better after it was broke in a little bit, but no. While it did soften up a little, it became a shedding mess (like others mentioned). The ""blasted"" texture that appears to be glued on, balled up and flaked off such that it looks absolutely awful. It's also impregnated with a reddish colored dye that will run and get everywhere if you perspire. I imagine it's there to color the thing so it looks less like the sole of a shoe and more like a quality leather strap...which it really isn't. A few reviewers used words like ""buttery soft"" and ""fine piece of jewelry"", but the one I got is far from fine or buttery. Maybe I got a bad one that was left out on a street somewhere in the blazing sun for a few months, but even then, it's a glued together piece of rawhide, nothing fine or quality about it.",0

446,"I bought two of these to try in my home hobby studio.  I am not a gear snob, but have a fair amount of experience in recording, electronics and live sound.  I wanted to use these to get a better guitar sound from a stereo effects pedal and synth by reducing the gain of the input signal, trying to find a more sweet spot for the preamps (right now, the pedal and mixer gains are turned way down).  I thought these might be a little better than the similar Pyle unit, which is half the price,and  I had good luck with a Nady wireless purchased many years ago.  Price point is about all I wanted to spend.  Based on my tests, one of the units had a dead channel (no output), and the other had a loud hum coming from one of the channels.  The hum was coming from the unit,did not change when I moved it around (thinking maybe there was an external source for it).  Overall QC seems bad, one unit had light scratches on the front panel, the screws holding it together were crooked.  They had plastic XLR jacks.  One thing I liked is the design allows for screw mounting of the units, hope that catches on.  The gain select switches were tight, and the stereo and ground switches were pushbutton; all felt cheap.  I sent them back, not something I do often.  Bottom line, if you are going to roll the dice on a cheap unit, I'd try the half price ones first.  The technology in these things is not rocket science, no excuse for a dead channel.  Apparently, buying any of these cheaper units is hit or miss.",0

450,"Planned failure like a lot of products. The base, tube & sheet holder are very sturdy built of steel.

451,"I really wanted to like this.  The effects I was trying to use sounded pretty good.  My problem with this unit arose when I accidentally added one of the hi gain amp sims to the effects chain.  There was immediate, high pitch, horrible feedback on my amps clean channel at minimal volume.  Turned the guitar volume off and feedback was still there, had to turn off the amp.  I emailed the manufacturer and after some back and forth they determined that feedback on high gain amp sims was normal and there was nothing wrong with the unit.  Sure I can turn the gain and level down after the sim is added to the chain but when you add the sim to another patch it defaults back to the original feedback creating settings.  I tried using the effects loop of the amp and going directly in and they had the same result.  I don't even plan on using the sims but its easy to scroll the wrong way when adding an effect and I got tired of the ear piercing scream.",0

464,"Pretty noisy. Not great shielding around the center core, I guess. Other patch cables I have reduce noise significantly more than this cable.

There's no such thing as ""tone"" of a cable though, so if you think your lava cable or monster cables ""sound"" better, either brighter or warmer depending on who you are, then you're drinking the kool-aid. Inherent capacitance of a cable CAN affect tone, but if you're getting tone-sucking capacitance in a six-inch cable, then it's broken and you need to get a new one anyway.

The only reason I don't like these ones is because of poor shielding letting in electromagnetic interference, not because of an inferior guitar tone. </soapbox>",0
465,Very cheaply made tuners and one knob was missing,0
466,"Low quality tuners, not smooth, lots of play in them.  I thought these might be comparable to the split shaft tuners on my Classic Vibe Squier, but they are inferior even to the Squier tuners.  You get what you pay for... On the plus side, MusicLily was great and they refunded me as soon as I sent the tuners back.  I have dealt with MusicLily before, both on Amazon and on Ebay, and they are a top-notch seller.  Most of their stuff is very good quality, and the few times I have been unsatisfied, they have been quick to issue a refund.  I took a chance based on my positive experiences with MusicLily.  I was unimpressed with the tuners, but I still like MusicLily  If they can increase the quality, I'd be willing to try them again.",0

At least the Snark tuners are accurate and respond quickly.",0
469,"This is a good kit if you don't want to invest too much money into one. I own a music studio and lessons store, so I bought this for the kids to bang on as I already have two other good kits.

The snare sounds like a garbage can lid, it was the only thing that came with a head on it, and it was slightly dented. There's no muffler so it rings like a bell. I would MAYBE let a student use this kit for performance, but that's about it, and only as a last resort. Wound up fixing it by using drum gum (on both heads!) and literal fine tuning to the heads and snare itself.

The cymbals sound worse than a garbage can lid. In fact, I think a garbage can lid would sound better as it would at least have some kind of decay. I laughed for about ten minutes after trying out the ""crash ride"". It's an expensive comedy, but worth it. It's one of those things that's just so terrible it's funny. Like Plan Nine From Outter Space, or Carrot Top.

The toms and bass are somewhat respectable. Had to stuff the bass drum though. You also need to know how to tune the drums correctly to get the most out of this... kit.

My chief complaint, and I'm sure the reason would be they don't want the heads to be damaged, is having to put the heads on the other drums. It's already a poorly made drum kit, even if the heads were dented it's not going to make that much of a difference. As usual, Mendini is all look and no quality.",0

I was aghast to discover that the MD-BT01 added 5 ms of latency!

It's definitely the nicest hardware in this price range, with well-designed features, good sound quality, and reasonable latency.  It's the Focusrite drivers that leave much to be desired.  I purchased a brand new high-end HP desktop for use as an audio workstation at home.  After checking out all the positive reviews here, I rolled the dice on this unit.  It worked fine when I originally installed it, but then *gasp* I shut down the computer.  When I turned it back on,  this little box went haywire.  All sound playback was slowed down and distorted.  The only solution that I found was to disconnect this box and plug it back in.  Then it worked.

So, I contacted Focusrite support and they took me through the standard cut and paste responses, of course blaming my computer hardware in the end for not loading the driver completely on reboot despite my having followed their directions to a T.

Only buy this light if you are using it static only

Unfortunately these new, ""less expensive"" EC heads have done away with the metallic material around the edges they started with. Instead they are etched with INK. Evans claims this helps to control the overtones. I've written on all my snare heads and it never affects the sound. Granted it is a thicker type of ink but upon tuning it to my various snare drums it doesn't measure up. Trust me, I've used the EC2's and 1's since they came out and can honestly say they are not as good as they once were.

2. The leather endpieces are so stiff that I was afraid I would yank the strap buttons out of the guitar, both when putting them on and later when removing them (before returning the item). Moreover the stiff leather is another likely source of scratches.

So basically: If you don't care about scratches, or if you have a strap button like the one shown, this can work for you. But otherwise beware.",0

507,"**Update**
I finally got Numark to send me a replacement C3USB, hoping it was a faulty unit.  I just set the new one up, hooked it to my speaker using XLR cables, and the same problem happened.  Apparently it is a design flaw.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE if you use this for ANYTHING other than playing music 100% of the time.

-Original review-
I like the features of this mixer.  I've used the Numark C1 for about 8 years with no problem but thought I could use the added features of the C3USB.  As stated in a few other reviews the background noise is quite prevalent.  Even when there is NO other hardware connected except one XLR cable to one powered speaker there is way too much background noise.  I am a wedding DJ.  If I were playing nothing but music I might be able to get by with it because the music would mask the noise but if there is silence or if someone is speaking (like a toast at a wedding reception or a couple exchanging vows... nothing important) you are going to hear it loud and clear.

I sent the until back to Numark and they said they found nothing wrong with it.  When I got it back, I set it back up, called Numark customer support, held the phone to the speaker and they were able to clearly hear the noise!  Now Numark wants me to take the C3FX in exchange but it's specs are worse than the C3USB and doesn't have the features I want.  Amazon won't take it back because it is past the 30 days since I purchased it even though the manufacturer had it most of the time.  I guess I just ate $170.

If you are a professional DJ you would be wise to stay clear of this one.",0
508,"I bought 2 of these. At first they appear to be great value.

For some reason amazon has merged the ratings for the Donner ""Alchemy"" pedal and the ""White Wizard""  So the reviews you read might not be for the product you selected...
 I had given the ""Alchemy""  5 Stars... and I was about to review the ""White Wizard"" and it took me to my old review... I had noticed this before... but now it has been proven..
there must be a lot of confusion with these products... at least I am confused... pretty confused...
I bought the White Wizard thinking it would be a step up from the ""Alchemy"" but I was wrong...
First of all The Wizard doesn't sound as good... the flanger has a horrible popcorn effect that is obviously a glitch or a defective unit, who knows?
 Another thing I did not appreciate was the fact that they don't list the actually modulation effects you are getting it just says 12 effects... going by the Alchemy, I thought they would be the same, plus a few others... but it does not come with PAN effect...
 this pedal being in stereo... on my alchemy the most used effect is the PAN to make trips sounding stuff go around the stage... NOPE it doesn't have that effect on the wizard for some stupid reason...
 All and all... I would highly recommend the ALCHEMY, and NOT the white WIZARD... also... please note... the ALCHEMY picture says hold to enter tap tempo... ALCHEMY does not have tap tempo functionality... The wizard does though...
 So, another misinformation there... I'm going to return the white wizard,.. and sadly.. will never order anything from Donner again... I thought they were like JOYO , Quality pedals for cheap prices... but they don't even come close to the built and sound quality of a JOYO pedal...
 if you are reading this, and are not familiar with the JOYO brand I highly recommend you check those out... Extremely cheap pedals that are of great quality... unlike this garbage.",0

516,"I purchased these because I develop iPhone software, which means that I have my phone next to the speakers all the time.  Having the phone next to the speakers means annoying buzzing sounds.  Since these have an optical in I thought that should solve the entire problem.  I have a set of Roland speakers which these are a clear ripoff of and they do not buzz at all.  The Behringer speakers have apparently no shielding at all in the left hand speaker which is connected to the right hand side by a distincly non-optical connection.  End result is I now get the annoying cell phone buzzing happening in one speaker.

Fit and finish of the speakers is sub par, the knobs on the front of the speakers are wobbly and cheap feeling.  There is a input for earphones in the front of the right hand speaker, but it is quarter inch instead of the now more common eighth of an inch.

The sound isn't bad though so that is a plus.  I would recommend getting the Roland versions of these since the Behringers are simply badly made versions of the Roland ones.",0
517,"Pros:
well-built, durable
cheap

Cons:
sonically-challenged, i.e. very very bad when compared

Radial Engineering JDI: A
Boss DI-1: A
Radial Engineering StageBug SB-2: B
L.R. Baggs Para DI: D
Whirlwind IMP 2: D

Early in my sound engineering career, my church used Whirlwind IMP 2's exclusively.  I didn't know any better.
I used these DIs to connect guitars, keyboards and basses.  They work .. and that's about the only good thing I have to say.

Then I bought myself a BOSS DI-1 on a whim.
OMG! OMG!  Where have you been??  The Jensen transformer is so .. heavenly!

In comparison the Whirlwind really really sucks -- muddy sound all around, very rolled-off high-end, no definition, slow, etc. etc.

How ignorant have I been all these years.

Sure, it's unfair to compare a $50 Chevy with a $200 Caddy.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Radial Engineering DI or other Jensen transformer DI and you'll see that every penny is worth the difference.",0

521,"This stand is a joke and a piece of junk. I ordered two of them to use for miking guitar cabinets for concerts. One showed up with the base repainted with flat black paint (the actual color is a semi-gloss dark black). For my purposes that's ok, but if you think you're going to get a nice one for your office desk, think again. The second stand had plenty of scuffs on it as well, but at least it didn't get repainted.

The included mic clip, or rather the stem the clip screws onto is a complete joke. The thread is not the standard size you find on other mic stands so a) if it breaks I'm going to have to track down an adapter (if they even exist) to mount a new clip, and b) the clip can only be used on this stand.

Thinking more about it, I should just return these things. Pretty sad that Amazon would allow such a cruddy product on its site.

There is a horrible whine on the USB channel on any channel with the levels set high on the mixer.  All of that is irrelevant, because after just over one year this product stopped working.  One morning I came to turn it on and had no sound out of the USB channel.  So I changed back to analog and sure enough two days later no sound from the right channel.  The mixer registers the audio in but does not pass it out to the outputs.  I use this as a channel mixer to route sound.  Not as a DJ mixer.  However, in my experience I wouldn't want to scratch with that crossfader.  It is not very smooth and quite stiff no matter how long you play with it.

So:
As a USB sound card this was a failure as it only worked in home use for just longer then the warranty.

As a mixer this thing has bad noise on the channels and a very loud 0 level.  This is at the very low end of mixer quality.

I gave the second star as it is the only USB mixer on the market at the price range.  Next step up is a BEHRINGER PRO MIXER VMX1000USB @ $199.00.  So I guess that is where you will find my next review.

I bought this tuner because the Snark, while pretty accurate, was very hard to see, except under the best circumstances, and because the polytune feature on Poly Tune Clip, whereby supposedly you can strum all six strings together and see which strings need to be tuned, seemed very cool.  So the ordinary part of this TC Electronic tuner is excellent.  I mean the lights are very bright, visible under virtually any circumstances, including outside in bright sunlight.  And the chromatic tuner is accurate and very fast.  But I could not get the polytune feature to work for me, no matter which guitar I tried it on, solid body electric, acoustic, or semi-hollow body electric.  It was simply unreadable to me.  Worse, when I sought advice or support from the manufacturer, I could find none, even after a fairly diligent search on line.  I was, then, effectively left with an excellent chromatic tuner, but at a price more than twice the cost of another excellent chromatic tuner, the Ubertuner from Kliq.

556,"FIRST IMPRESSION:
I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars. A very good piece of gear. This unit has great pres, great headroom, low noise, and intuitive interface, the only reason for 4 1/2 stars is (because of price point) plastic construction (albeit thick, and probably will never break especially if in a bag), only two XLRs (which a simple cable will fix) and medium battery life (which is fixable with numerous external USB solutions), and no sync option. Oh, and the unit will reset to factory time/date if batteries are removed for too long (why?). All these things are totally forgivable at the sub-$200 mark. I promise you that whatever you record with this will be perfectly professionally acceptable. For some, it might be their last recorder if other features are not required, and idiosynchrasies deemed acceptable.

NOW:
It's failed. First the external power via USB, and now it will not recognize any cards, even though all of those work perfectly well in other devices. So, perhaps I have a bad unit?",0
557,"Just sounds bad - maybe I had a bad guitar, but I would not recommend this one to anyone. Play one in a music store first before you buy online.",0
558,"On the surface the G3X is an excellent piece of equipment that is easy to use and, considering the price, does a great many things reasonably well: it's got a tons of effects, amp modeling, looping, tuning, drum machine, expression pedal, good output options, and a well-implemented user interface. The way the drum patterns sync with the looper is great, as is the fact that you can set the loop manually or by dialing in the number of measures.

Yes, the tuner could be more stable, and the looper could last longer (it's only 40 seconds, 20 with undo), and maybe the sound quality isn't the absolute greatest, but for $200 and my purposes (practicing and composing) I don't care about the flaws. In fact, normally I would have given the G3X five stars.

Unfortunately, it breaks very easily, and, if it's out of warranty, you are out of luck--Zoom will not supply parts to you or any repair shop.

But it's built like a tank, you say. What could go wrong? Well, it turns out the row of seven buttons at the top (Scroll, Tap Tempo, Rhythm, etc.) are actually a single custom-made piece of plastic, and each button is attached to the whole by two spindly arms, sort of like parts in a plastic model kit (see photo). Depending on how you use the G3X, some of those buttons, like tap tempo (or, in my case, the rhythm button), get pushed frequently, tens if not hundreds of thousands of times in a couple years. Guess what happens.

That's right! The flimsy little arms break! Now the affected button won't work unless you muck around and push and pick at it in frustration. Forget about it if the arms to the tap tempo button breaks. (Strictly speaking, the actual switches are surface-mounted to a circuit board and continue to work fine. When I say ""button"" above, I am really talking about a ""button actuator"").

What are your options at this point? Well, don't waste money at a repair shop, because as of January 2013, there are no Zoom-authorized shops, and Zoom will not supply parts to anyone, including repair shops.

Zoom will, however, send you a brand new G3X with one-year warranty for *only* $110 in exchange for your now unrepairable unit. You pay shipping both ways, so add another $20 at least. That makes $130+ to exchange a $199 piece of equipment, all because of a cheap, poorly designed plastic part that Zoom refuses to make available. I guess that's a good deal if you manage to use and abuse the G3X for several years before it breaks, but mine got less than two years of very gentle use before breaking.

I made a temporary fix with some carefully placed bits of tape, but eventually went for the exchange. Fortunately, I had used a credit card that doubled the warranty. The card paid $119 leaving me on the hook for only $16 in shipping costs. I strongly recommend that you buy the G3X with a credit card that has warranty doubling (most of them do), keep all the paperwork, and register both online and by mailing in the warranty card. The warranty card states, among other things, ""The warranty granted in this document will be void unless you: 1. Return the warranty registration card within 10 days from the date of your purchase ..."" As far as I've been able to determine with some cursory research, that is a legally enforceable requirement for limited warranties.

It would be great if Zoom would make a file available for 3D printing the part, but I am not holding my breath, nor I am sure 3D printing would be precise and strong enough to create a replacement part.

On the plus side, Zoom North America's customer service is very good--they answer their phones, respond to emails in a timely manner, and are as helpful as possible given the limitation (no spare parts) that they are working under.

Two other minor complaints (these would not affect my rating one way or the other):

1) The pedal function cannot be assigned globally, so if you want to use it as, say, a volume pedal for all your patches, then you have to add it to every patch.

2) There is a small tactile switch under the pedal that can be assigned to turn an effect off and on if the pedal is assigned to that effect, but the physical design of the pedal/button combination is poor. Pushing the pedal all the way down and then applying additional pressure compresses a large foam pad on the underside the pedal. This is supposed to allow a much smaller piece of foam to hit the button, but it doesn't work because the button is too far away no matter how much the large pad is compressed. I called Zoom, and they sent me an additional bit of foam with adhesive which I added to the existing small piece of foam. The jury-rigged actuator was a tad too long, so the button sometimes got hit accidentally. Relying on foam and a tactile switch is ridiculous. They should have used a stomp switch like a Crybaby pedal. The whole switch thing seems like a botched afterthought. (In keeping with their policy of not supplying parts, Zoom will no longer send you the bit of extender foam, so don't bother calling them about that.)",0
559,"When I pay $14 for a set of strings, I expect them to be way better that a $6 set.  Sadly, ELIXER is falling down in their quality control.  This most recent set of strings I bought sounded like a 6 month old set of six dollar strings as soon as I put them on the guitar.  I'm willing to pay the extra for strings that sound bell-clear AND stay that way for at least a month or two afterwards.  This is the second set of bad strings I've gotten from ELIXER.  I bought a set of ""POLYWEB"" strings, thinking they'd be better.  They were ""dead-on-arrival"" as well.  Maybe that's the intention - a 'duller' sound?  I don't know.  But ""NANOWEB"" have always been bell-clear and bright.  Not this time.  Let's see if I actually get a refund or credit.  Otherwise, I'm done with ELIXER.  I certainly cannot return them now that they've been put on the guitar and trimmed.",0

563,"First off, if you're one of the people who've gotten this to work consistently, congrats and I'm glad you're happy.  There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?

Update:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.

While it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.

Second Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!",0

The quality is absolutely horrible and I would not recumbent this mixer to anyone weather an beginner or pro dj. This is by far the worst dj product that I have ever bought. This product is straight weak and we should ship all of these mixers back to Germany and cut their products off until they can create a product with at least the quality of a numark product. Do not buy this mixer. Own 7 mixers from all different brands and I love them all. I know features and I know quality.

574,"OK, folks, I read the reviews on this: The good, the bad, the in-between... Maybe they made some good ones.

  I bought this neck, for a project I wasn't too concerned about, but did want it to work. Now, this is a guitar neck for under $40, so I wasn't expecting custom shop quality and performance, but expected more than future 'kindling' ...

  They say its Canadian maple, so how bad could it be???

  The ""good"" list is short, so I'll do that first... Intonation seems to be pretty good

  The ""bad"" ~~ Yes the frets were sharp, but this was expected and quickly addressed, most aftermarket neck need dressing, no big deal.........the 'finish' is extremely cheap looks it!.....it came 'pre-dented' ......  has 22 frets but above the top fret , for no reason,  it juts out about 1/2 inch and has very sharp corners ... Nut is crap, and should be replaced.... no skunk stripe ...  fret markers look like they were stamped on....fretboard is essentially flat, there seems to be no curvature, at all, so it's kina uncomfortable....  BUT the absolute worst of all, is that, while setting up, I gave about 3/4 turn on the truss, and heard an internal C~C~CRACK!! Got it to be semi-playable, but will keep my eyes open for something playable.

  I gave it 2 stars, because it is sorta-usable, but I highly recommend looking elsewhere, spending some money, and getting something more stable, and durable. Also, I didn't expect a whole lot, for the price, so a 1 star, would be unfair.",0

583,"As the title says; save your money and get an ACTUAL tube amp, like the Marshall DSL15C, which is lighter, and smaller, and the controls are up front, not stuck in back like the CR60C. If you want to match the weight and size of the CR60C, you have many options including Fender or Marshall.
While the Orange does have an OK sounding dirty channel, where gain control volume can be turned way down, that's about where it ends.
The amp is close to 45 Lbs. (DSL15C is 39.7), which is VERY HEAVY for a 1x12 solid state amp., and is wider than it has to be.
The controls are located at the top/back of the unit which is hard to get to if pushed up close to a wall for practice.
The Clean Channel offers NOTHING, and is as milk toast as it can get, which means the speaker is just OK.
I have a lot of new amps from Mesa, Fender (most of my amps), Roland, Marshall, Line 6, Vox, Etc., Etc., and this amp kinda falls
into a boutique-ish category that makes it above average for overdrive applications, and just OK for everything else.
I actually get much better overdrive, and clean out of my Champion 40, and Mesa V-twin Pre-Amp pedal, or the Marshall DSL15C.

I bought this tuner for two reasons; 1. The D'Addario brand, and 2.

On the other hand, I have more than six D'Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tuners which up till now have worked great. I have only had to change batteries after a lot of use on three acoustic and five electric guitars.

618,"Before I ordered the B7/V7 combo I contacted Vibramate to ask if this Bigsby would install on my Epi Les Paul 100. The answer was ""yes"" but the real answer is ""no"". Not even close. First you need 6"" between your guitar tail piece and the bottom of the guitar (where your strap connects). Less than 6"" and it's an instant problem. The other problem I had was the Vibramate tail piece did not align with the strap bolt which is required since the strap bolt is used to fasten the Vibramate tail piece the the guitar. The instructions say not to tighten down the ""dog bone"" plate (B7 part) to tight. This allows for some movement to align the Vibramate tail piece to the strap bolt. I did this and it would not align. The net is if you have an Epi Les Paul 100 this combo does not work even though Vibramate (in person and on their site) says it will. I also measured my Epiphone Les Paul Custom and because the distance I stated above is less then 6"" it will not work on that model either. I'm going to try the B5/V5 next.",0

I thought this new design looked a little better and lower-profile, as opposed to some coat hanger on the headstock. But I must say after using the NS Micro for a few jams and gigs that the Snark is more accurate and gives results faster. I also find that the Snark stays where I put it, while the NS moves around too much with its weak little clamp, especially on my Les Paul.

One particularly annoying thing about the NS is that it seems to become ""confused"" when I'm standing next to the drummer while he's playing. I don't know if there is some vibration transferring to the tuner somehow, but the end result is that getting a good solid read on the tuning is very difficult. It's better between songs, but still slower and not as accurate as I'd like.

Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying the Snark is the be-all, end-all. I'd like to have a Peterson StroboClip if money were no object and I wasn't so prone to breaking small electronics.

634,"NOTE: I originally bought an AudioBox USB as part of an audio package but needed to re-order a separate AudioBox and wanted to warn other potential buyers.  Here's why:

Upon setup, the PreSonus AudioBox USB wasn't being recognized by my MacAir (supposed to be plug/play).  I am comfortable with tech equipment but still thought it could have been my mistake.

I called the PreSonus tech line and was on hold for 35 minutes until closing time and then got a cheerful recording that they were closed and I should call back during business hours.  Okay, I'm still stuck so I called back the next day and waited about 40 minutes this time -- I don't blame the techs, they are understaffed.  When I finally got a tech he did a quick diagnostic and announced ""Yes, your AudioBox has a problem and we are aware of it.  We've had a problem with some units recently.""  Great.  (BTW, how many is ""some"" units?  A hundred?  A thousand?)

He then told me to ""call Amazon"" about the return.  What?  Your company made the defective equipment and I wasn't going to re-pack the mic, cables, pop-filter, stand, headphones (from the full audio package I originally bought) just to return the AudioBox.  When I called back and spoke with a supervisor to get a phantom Return Authorization I was told the same thing.  The best he could do was ""send me a form"" so they would consider repairing it but he wouldn't even commit to a matter of weeks for turnaround.  Super.  They even wanted me to provide them with the unit's serial number so they could ""track the problem"".  Apparently track but ignore.  (If they are defective, recall them or do the right thing and replace without hassle.)

Finally, because I was stuck with everything else, I ordered a new AudioBox (on its own, a separate order from Amazon) and then returned the old one in its place.  (I would have ordered a different brand but then I couldn't have returned the first AudioBox.)  Thankfully, the second AudioBox was not a lemon, too.

Amazon handled the solo return perfectly and amazingly fast.  The refund was in my account the day after an easy UPS pick-up.  Really happy with Amazon but don't count on PreSonus.  Even their beloved software set-up was needlessly annoying -- do you really need a 28-digit key code???  This isn't a nuclear launch.  Also, the ""Studio One Artist 2"" software was overly convoluted (just the name hints at that -- call it ""1"" or ""2"" but not both).  Crappy manual as well.

I ended up using their hardware but with Mac's GarageBand which was so much easier to deal with and learn.

Bottom line, order if you must, but beware.  Don't count on PreSonus corporate office for anything.  Consider other audio interfaces.  Zero stars for AudioBox USB, 4 stars for rest of equipment (in the original package -- see other review).  Headphones are a bit cheap but great mic.",0

So, it came and I was tickled. This is my dads favorite guitar... Yeaaaah man!!! Doing my dad proud!! Dad gets home, and I show him my new guitar "" I have so many I lost count"" and so, at first sight he hates it and says in not a real les paul

655,"Undeniably it's cute.  It's fun to mess around with when I'm on the bus or the train, but I find it useless to record with.  Here's why:

I don't like DAW's.  I record live onto an 8-track, which is pretty difficult with this machine.  If you're dealing with 16th notes, the 16-step memory means you're limited to a 1-measure drum track.  Whether it's hip-hop, rock, blues, or jazz, I tend to write 8-measure or 16-measure parts, sometimes 32-bar parts, so from a creative standpoint and a live recording standpoint, it's not all that great.  You can mitigate somewhat, by storing several parts in the memory, but it only stores 8 recordings, so the best you can do is 8-measures, with you having to trigger each of the different parts at the start of each bar.

You can't vary the volume of attack for each individual part of the kit, so beats sound artificial and, well, machine-like.

As far as I know, there's no way to alter or even deactivate the quantization, which is set to straight 16ths, nor is there a way to create a syncopation effect.  So everything is stuck rigidly.  You can remedy with stutter, decay settings, and use of delay.  But it's quite a lot of knob twisting (for 1-measure of a beat) to get something only semi-correct.

In terms of sounds, they're all pretty cool and fairy malleable, with one exception.  The snare drum, at best, sounds like a bag of Doritos, at worst it sounds like static in the recording mix.  There's also no ride cymbal.

There's no undo function, and it's really easy to accidentally hit the wrong key and save over something else by accident.  There's also no current memory of what you're doing.  So if you switch off, without saving, your beat is gone.  Likewise, if you haven't saved and you're groovin' and suddenly decide to switch to a beat in the memory, you can't switch back out.  If the beat wasn't pre-saved, it's just gone.

The built-in speaker is just an insult to human ears.  Obviously you can and should use headphones, but I just get annoyed knowing it's even there.

I do have some nice things to say about the Volca Beats.  The battery life is great.  The thing is tiny, and super portable.  It is easy to use.  You can figure out the basics in under 5 minutes and come to understand every function on it in the first hour you sit with it.  The decay, pitch, and grain knobs are easy to use and offer a lot of variety.  It's simple to hook up to a mixer, 4-track, or other portastudio.  You just need a small to large stereo cable.  It works well with the Volca Keys, which I also have and give 5 stars to.  They hook together and sync up nicely.  It's fun to use.  I throw mine in my bag, no-matter where I go.  It's great during a commute.

All that said, it's also $150.  While I'd like to say that makes it worth the money, the thing is you can get Garageband on your ipad for $10, and forget the DAW aspect of it, you can just use it as a drum machine, that can hold hundreds of bars of drum beats.  You hook it up exactly the same way.  The difference is it's $140 cheaper (Assuming you half a smartphone or tablet).  Furthermore, the app offers natural sounding recordings because it has a variety of quanitization options, including the option to run different quanitization patterns on one beat.  It also offers the option to syncopate, and vary the attack volume for each drum piece (either creating settings for each piece of kit, or setting the volume based on how hard you tap a given part.  You can record live or using step-by-step entry.  It features a greater tempo range, and it has an in-ear metronome function that the Korg doe not.  Finally it has 5 or 6 as many sound options.  For quick beat creation, it also features an input function, where you simply drag and drop icons of different instruments at different X/Y access points on a grid, that the program then uses to create instant, plug-in-play beats.  The interface, at least on an iPad also offers much more working space for your hands, making it relatively easy to place 4 or 5 parts at the same time live on the Garageband software.

Sorry for going off on sales pitch for Garageband.  The point is that I find my Garageband iPad solution a better option for making beats on the spot, and definitely much better for recording, and it costs 1/15 as much as the Volca beats.  And I'm sure others can think of an array of solutions that deliver the same portability and ease of use while providing  more dynamic functionality, better memory, and more sound options for less money.

I'll soon post a review of the Volca Keys and try to be as thorough.  I can say at the start, that unlike it's cousin, the beats, I find the Volca Keys to be great value for money, offering unique functionality and an extraordinary level of functionality and playability for such a tiny unit.  Oh and it's cute too.",0

663,"Initially I was impressed with the construction of this pedal. It seems rather well built for the price.... thats where the positivity ends. I plugged it into my power supply and it didn't work so I switched to a 9 volt. I took the cover off, attached the battery and spent the next five minutes trying to put the cover back on correctly. The battery cover is a prime example of piss poor engineering IMHO. I plugged it into my rig and when I played I could not believe what I heard.... utter CRAP! Tinny, shrill, thin and above all NOISE NOISE NOISE! I guess there are some things you cannot go cheap on... I've learned my lesson here!",0
664,"I was duped into buying this, but it has a serious flaw that not one reviewer mentioned.  Once the gate is engaged, it cannot turn off fast enough without chopping off the attack of your notes.

If you are muting, then play a big chord, the first (say) 20ms of the attack is cut off, so it sounds like you are playing through a limiter.  It just sounds bad.  Also, the pedal robs high frequency content, so notes sound rounded off.  Beginners probably won't notice this or care, because it hides the background hum.

I have used the NS-2 before and that is a better pedal, at least it can track notes without cutting off your transients, however it will also rob high frequency tone, but in a different, more pleasing way than this pedal.  This pedal really takes the heft and edge out of your tone.  It neuteurs it.  It makes it sound as if you have rolled off your guitars volume slightly.

At this point, the only pedal left to try is the Decimator.  I have been used to built in (digital) noise suppressors in Boss GT processors, and I am spoiled because they work great.  Unless a standalone pedal has a fantastic input buffer, it will rob tone.

Take it from a long term player, this is relative junk.",0

On the 12 string they were acceptable, but that guitar had an abundance of highs to begin with.

This pedal is horrible, and I can't imagine how any musician who cares about their sound would find it acceptable.  It cannot be powered through a daisy-chain with other pedals.  There is a significant volume drop when it is switched on, it introduces a hissing noise, and there is very noticeable bass roll-off.  Underneath all that, yes, it applies a pretty nice chorus effect, but the tradeoff is not worth it.  There are some trimpots inside that can be messed with a bit, but they don't do anything to fix the problems.

This purchase has been a learning experience and a lot of work. So the guitar was not playable out of the box and if I cannot adjust the intonation I would like to return it.

Since I wrote the above review I measured the scale length on the guitar and found that the bridge is placed about 1/2 an inch outside the scale length, so the bridge would have to be mover up about 1/2 inch before the intonation can be set.

700,"Well, I guess you shouldn't really expect a whole bunch, especially when you're paying less than $30 for an effects pedal. I received this as a birthday present when I was 15, so I suppose I don't have to worry about any of my money being wasted. But if you're really serious about music and on a budget, I suggest saving up, waiting, and getting a better distortion pedal, such as the ones this pedal tries to emulate (BOSS DS-1, MXR D+, ProCo RAT).

Pros:
-Super cheap
-Emulates three different pedals for a variety of sound to choose from.

Cons:
-The emulations themselves are poor. The DS-1 emulation is shrill, irritating, noisy, and makes your tone extremely thin. The D+ emulation falls short of the original pedal in terms of tone and clarity, and finally, the RAT emulation has nowhere near the same, deep grumble and growl of the original pedal.
-The pedal is not good bypass. At first I didn't notice it, but when I finally purchased a better amplifier and started playing at louder volumes, I was able to notice that the ""clean"" setting still has slight bits of distortion. Even though the switch is in the off position, the distortion doesn't completely turn off. This is bad because you need to have access to your clean tones during the middle of a performance or recording. This is why pedals turn on and off. Regardless of your opinion of the sound or quality of the actual distortion, this fact alone is enough reason not to buy this pedal.
-The pedal itself is constructed of plastic, so it feels cheap in your hand compared to the nice metal build of most other guitar effects pedals.
-The power input is located on the side of the pedal, right next to the input jack. This is literally one of the most inconvenient locations to place the power input, especially when your power supply is a daisy chain and you're connecting multiple pedals.
-Unlike other pedals which conveniently have a clip-on cover (Ibanez Tube Screamer, for example) or an easily turnable screw (Boss pedals), you have to have two finely pointed objects (I used pens) to push in two separate buttons on each side to open the battery compartment of this pedal. Literally, you cannot open it with just your fingers. This is a huge inconvenience if you are needing to change the batteries quickly.

Overall, I would not at all recommend this pedal to anybody, especially when one of the pedals it attempts to emulate, the Boss DS-1, is a thousand times better quality and only about twenty to thirty dollars more expensive at $45. I literally cannot think of any decent reason for you to purchase this pedal, either for yourself or for a friend of yours who enjoys music. Save up the money and get something that is worth your time and will actually serve you in the long run. 1/5.",0

724,"While I like the innovation of K&K's three-lobe Pure Pickup (and fully intend to buy one), I didn't like this preamp at all, save for its clip-on-to-your-belt size. But that one feature was not enough to make me keep it. And if you did clip it to your belt, just try to adjust those little bitty knobs! They don't even have a center-detent.

There's also no provision for an outside power source; all you have for power is the internal 9v battery.

And there just aren't enough ""bells and whistles"" for me; no compression, tuner, XLR out. And something about the construction makes it seem like something some weekend warrior would build on his workbench, in the garage.

If you want just a basic preamp and that's ALL, then I guess there are instances where this would be a great little unit, so I'm not slammin' it; for what it is, it's not a bad unit.

And like I already said, I consider the K&K Pure Guitar Pickup to be a revolution in pickup design, and others seem to feel the same way (I like to call it the ""Hydra"", due to its three ""heads"").

So K&K will wind up getting some of my business, just not in the preamp department.",0

736,"I had high hopes for the these strings based on the reviews here. I have to say these are the worst sounding pure nickel strings I've ever put on my Mustang. My go to strings have been Dr. Pure Blues, and I've always used Ernie Ball (Pure Nickel and Slinky) and D'Addario strings on it.

First, these strings are really loud on for pure nickel strings. I was shocked, but I had to turn the volume down on my amp to compensate.

Second, these strings were not the usual warm sound I expect from nickel strings. They were very present and middy, and I mean VERY PRESENT AND MIDDY. These strings demanded to be heard above my effects etc.

I'm a fuzz guy, and it sounded awful with these strings. Really flat and splattery. The only pedal that improved with these strings was my wah. It loved the increased output and mids and sounded amazing.

I tried to shape the tone with my EQ and that helped some. I keep my EQ at the end of my pedal chain instead of in the effects loop, maybe that would work better.

741,"I wanted to like this recording device, but it did not work out so well. There is a lot to like but not to my needs. First things the entire recording process takes too long from start to finish on just one song. You have to first create a song file, then you have to change the inputs, then you have to press the track buttons, then you have to press record and play in that order. You can play back but don't even think about just taking out the SD card to play somewhere else. You have to export it first, that takes time. Even longer if you recorded a 5-6 minute song.

There is still a slight buzzing in the system, well I can live with that because its minimal. The recording sounded okay after I exported the WAV file to my audio editing software. The other awful thing is that the SD recording media card is hidden inside the battery compartment. So you have to remove at least 2 of the four batteries to access the SD card. Again time consuming. Too much work for one or two recordings.

The other part is the recording process system. You have to remember too many things to successfully record your song. Like you have to press the recording input tracks first, then while they are blinking, press record and play. Coming from my trusty Zoom H6n digital recorder this is too much technical stuff and and not enough artistic creation.

All I wanted was to use the TASCAM DP-006 recorder in place of my Zoom H6n. But now I don't know... I will too busy remembering all of the steps and not spending the time creating new songs. I am sure that I could get use to this. I am sure this would work. But I have had easier recording experiences, so why make it so difficult. Its almost like my TASCAMS from the 1990's. Very technical. I am sure that some people won't mind but those are people who like technical steps. The artistic types don't dwell on the mechanical tinkering.

My wish is that it would be small and efficient. It is small... but NOT efficient. I would like it to just record a song, have the device create a new song file without the extra steps. Pull out the SD card when I am done, and then do final editing on the computer.

Pros: Like the small size, the battery idea is good, sound quality decent. Good price. Good internal microphones.
Cons: SD card poor location, AC power extra $, line out and headphone same input, recording process complicated.

745,"My low rating is based on two aspects: quality control and performance.
I tried two identical sets of these pickups (one form amazon, another from elsewhere).
With one set I ran into the same problem many other folks reported: a dead pickup. You don't need to install it in order to find it out: it is enough to measure the resistance between the wires. While it was correct on 2 pickups, it was infinite for the 3rd one, which means damaged wire.

The other set had all pickups alive, although I must say that the wire was unwrapping and falling off the body on one of the pickups. I installed them nevertheless and they worked.
Now I want to comment on the performance. I was replacing ceramic pickups on an extra-cheap strat imitation guitar Giannini G-100 (from Costco) and naturally expected much better sound out of genuine Fender pickups. To my great surprise, the difference in sound was marginal. I of course tested all three pickup with clean and distorted modes. The worst part is that these pickups are much, much noisier than the original Giannini pickups. Even in ""humbucking"" 2nd and 4th switch position there was a lot of buzz, which is absent with the original pickups to which I returned.

The bottom line is, don't bother upgrading with Tex-Mex.",0

I could not intonate the A strings in the 10s sets, and the A string in the 9s sets buzzed all over the fretboard.

Not very useful compared to making your own out of string and little pieces of cloth stitched together, custom fitting it to your instrument,  which is what I do and will continue to do. For when you drag your own swap with  little pieces of cloth on a string through your recorder or wind instrument, a one foot or longer string of them, they stay relatively dry while the inside of the recorder or wind instrument gets dried too. Thus they can thus be used again and again in the same session. Also of course a cheaper way to keep your instrument clean and dry inside.

753,"I ordered the neck with the skunk stripe for my ""Gilmore inspired"" build. That is to say, I built a black stratocaster inspired by David Gilmore's black strat but with a few changes that I prefer like hard-tail bridge vs trem and locking tuners.

I paid for but did not receive the version with the skunk stripe. Rather, I was sent the version that has no stripe. I paid extra to get the stripe. It is, clearly, not practical to return items to China. Kmise was kind enough to refund $7 dollar difference. In short, this review is for the similar neck with no stripe.

Let's start with the good. The wood is solid. The neck is straight. The frets have very minor edges, but I have worked with much worse; like razor blades worse. The gloss amber finish sold my initial impression. Out of the box, this was a beautiful neck. The condition this neck arrived in prompted me to consider using it for my build in spite of not being exactly what I wanted.

How did it go? Well, let's begin with 5 paragraphs of gratuitous laurels about my expertise like so many reviewers do ... or not. It's enough to say that I have the tools and expertise to tackle any guitar project including designing and building experimental and artistic models of my own design.

Don't waste your time and money on this neck unless it's intended for a wall decoration. The heel is not stratocaster (rounded profile). It is Telecaster (flat profile). It required taking one of my strat profile necks, making an MDF template by using a pattern bit on my table router, and using my new template to re-profile this neck to specs. Some 'tweeking' is usually needed for clone necks, but this one is *way* off.

The finish looks great, but it is atrocious. I tested lacquer thinner and mineral spirits on the back of the head stock to see what would work. Neither did. This leads me to believe the finish is likely a polymer similar to car finish. You can get great glossy results with extremely fast curing times speeding production. However, it can also be problematic. My concern about the finish is the result of changing the nut to a Black TUSQ. I use the flat pliers method slowly rocking the old nut until it can be removed without damaging the finish or tearing the fretboard above the nut. I placed tape above and below the nut to protect the finish, but it shattered on the low E side. Then, much to my dismay, removing the tape (painter's tape) lifted a large area of finish from the head stock right down to the bare wood. This can happen when applying any type of finish if the surface of the wood is not properly cleaned. Contamination interferes with the adhesion of the finish. We'll circle back in a moment.

The frets are terrible. They measure 2.42mm wide placing them in the Medium category. The issue is that they are only 0.89mm tall from the fretboard. When the frets are so short, it's as if the board is fretless making clean barr chords nearly impossible. I measured my other guitars' frets and found fret heights of 1.05mm to 1.21mm. Those guitars are not high end in the least and have the stock frets they arrived with. Time to re-fret this neck? Sure, that would be the logical thing to do, and re-fretting a neck isn't as difficult as it seems. Except, remember the finish? I can't be certain, but removing the frets will likely reveal more flaws in the finish adhesion resulting in a neck that isn't worth the time to restore. I would have to sand down the 'what-ever-it-is' finish entirely to get back to base wood, re-fret, and refinish.

These finished necks seem like great time savers, but they just aren't. This neck is clearly made from a beautiful piece of rock hard maple ... such a waste of good wood. On behalf of the tree that gave it's life, shame on you Kmise. I will not purchase another neck from this supplier.

P.S. No, it won't go to the wood pile. I'll store it until I'm bored enough to do all the work needed to re-fret and restore it. It is, at least, a nice piece of maple.",0

I had bought two of them, the first one the pickups were microphonic so they allowed me to trade for a squire classic vibe surf strat ( very good sounding guitar because of the pups but it also had flaws ) then i decided to try to buy another squier standard. Bad mistake ! The pickups work but they sound like you are dragging a hubcap across a tin roof ! Especially at higher gain. They build the pickups with quality plastic covers , stagger the poles , so they look cool , but they are terrible . The body, paintjob and hardware is good , and the necks aren't bad , but unless you are going to put an EMG or high output pups in, you won't get much out of these. Its a shame because they are nice looking guitars with 22 fret necks but they suck. They need to at least use basswood as the body wood. That is what my surf strat is made of and its a great playing guitar. If you are going to get a squier, get their classic vibe series- they still have a few flaws but are put together alot better.

And as a side note, they sent me the wrong guitar - a squire bullet HSS and it was better sounding than the Standard i got ? Squier really isn't that great of a company. Their competitor Epiphone makes better low end guitars but strats are better looking.

The best way to get a squier is to have it sent to a local shop and try before you buy.",0

774,"I took the Leslie Digital Pedal out of the box.  A bit heavy and big sized, but did not mind it cause it looks sturdy.  Immediately I hooked up the cables and played with it for four hours.  My judgment on this product is not going to be favorable as the other reviews I read.  Foremost let me say that I bought this pedal for my older Clonewheel Organ model.  I thought by maybe purchasing this product I would get more of an orgasmic organ.  I will not get into the details of the features like the Distance, Rise & Fall, Overdrive knobs, etc, because there is more of an important point I will mention. The pivotal  point is that the  tone of your keyboard will be compromised when it goes through this pedal.  After adjusting the levels and mix when I clicked the bypass switch I heard more presence in my natural Clonewheel Organ than when I turned on the Leslie Pedal.  The highs are gone, the mids are boosted, and some of the frequency gets manipulated in such a way that it changes the character of your drawbar settings.  The 4 simulated Leslie Cabinets each have noticeable differences, but when your sound is compromised what good is it for me to go into each cabinet? I have strong suspicion that this pedal was made by a guitar player.  The obvious reason is that it has foot switches on it, but when you see the advertisement of this product used by keyboardist they have the pedal on top of their keyboard and they are switching their ""speaker"" speed by clicking the Slow-Fast foot switch their hands.  i tried playing it both ways.  On top of the keyboard and down on the floor.  Both don't make sense.  The buttons are cumbersome and hard to press down on your hand.  Check out the Leslie product videos on youtube on this pedal.  You can see that the player awkwardly slamming down the buttons with their meaty part of their hands.  It's not fluid enough for a true organist to play a phrase while slamming down the Slow-Fast button. It makes sense why a B3 has a half moon switch attached on the left side.  It's easier to get to it, and requires no muscles to activate it.  I put it down the floor and found it unnatural pedaling the foot switches.  You already have your right foot on the volume pedal, and now you have to switch the Leslie with your left feet?  That is fine I guess if you use the Leslie sparingly, but I am a player that  use the Leslie every 10 seconds.  Also the switches are noisy.  If you are playing softly everybody can hear you constantly switching the pedal on and off.  Highly unmusical.  As for the speed inside the pedal I noticed that the modulation was a bit slower than my Clonewheel organ.  So I looked some videos of B3 players on youtube, and found out that when the Lesie is turned on high gear the modulation varies from each B3.  So what I am trying to say is that the high speed in this pedal is not official.  Matter a fact I found that my board that already had the Leslie effect on it wasn't that off to begin with it.  It's like getting a second wife and finding out that your first wife was the one for you after all.  I had to buy this pedal to have a peace of mind to find out whether this pedal would make a major difference than my onboard Leslie.  It didn't.
Conclusion:  It's not worthed for the reason I mentioned above and also the price point. To be fair the The Leslie Pedal should be no more than $200.  Also remember that I used this pedal for my Clonewheel organ.  The minute you plug in the pedal the sound of your amp and keyboard will change.  It will not change drastically, but for a seasoned musican it's extremely noticeable and for a reputable company as Leslie it's unprofessional in my opinion.  So I assume that if you are a guitarist it will do the same.  The foot switches are noisy and not made to stomp with your hands.  It's built for the floor so ignore all Leslie ads.  Here is an example of a product that advertised for keyboard players and failed.  I am willing to bet that most Clonewheel organs that were made in this century will already have a descent Leslie simulation effect built in.  Unless you have a cheap keyboard then it's another story.  If you have some of the newer Clonewheel organs than stop reading reviews and go to sleep peacefully, cause believe me that the audience will not tell the difference of your built in Leslie or whether you are clicking this pedal.  Too much money to waste on this detail.  I find this shameful especially for Leslie company, because they took no consideration for the organ/keyboard players.  You do have a CU-1 input in the back to attach to a Leslie half moon switch(sold seperately) to control your speed manually, but that is about it.  False advertisement.  This is a pedal for guitarist and I would say that this would be a studio piece.  If you hooked up a guitar to play ""Black Hole Sun"" and you left it on one setting for the whole song than its worthed it.  If you are going to play Stevie Ray Vaughn or any David Gilmour stuff I would be dubious.  Those are two guitarist that are known for their legendary tone, and I don't see David Gilmour using this pedal to compromise his tone.  Now I understand that most people will not bring a real Leslie Speakers on their gigs, but this pedal changes your character of your pure sound.  I am also aware that the more stomp pedals you string the more you are tampering with your pure sound.  Now if a pedal cost in between $330-$400 it better act its price.",0

(1) The Speakon connectors are low quality in my opinion. My biggest complaint is how poorly they mate with the connectors on my powered mixer. I also tried them on my power amp, which is the heart of my studio sound system with the same results - no smooth fit and disengaging from the mated connectors is even worse. I had to use pliers in one instance!

(2) Cables are fragile. I've experienced over a fifty percent failure rate with over ten cables. Not a good indicator of quality in my opinion.

It is possible to cure flaw (2) by re-soldering the connection points,. Fortunately, the connectors are designed for quick removal and to provide access to the wires. However, that means that you still need to purchase decent quality Speakon connectors to rectify flaw (1). Considering the additional costs it is probably cheaper to purchase a higher quality brand in the first place.

Another point is I agree with others that the cable gauge does not appear to be 12 ga. That is not the barrier to me because it is still heavy duty. It's the failure rate and what I consider to be extremely low quality Speakon connectors that compel me to recommend against this cable.",0

In fact, the only difference I noticed was that after 20 minutes at rehearsal last evening the cable was in a tangled up mess.  I unplugged the cable and tossed this mess into the corner and plugged back into my black solid monster cable.  The monster cable is no way totally tanglefree, but this GLS cable was a disaster.  I could never take this to the stage unless I stood in one place all night which is never gonna happen.  Anyway, these cables will be returned to amazon with a complaint on performance..  Maybe I got 2 bad cables?  Im going to post this same review on the other GLS cable that I purchased too.",0
785,"Budget cymbals from all the big makers are generally overpriced brass clunkers, and the ZBT crash/ride is no exception. Good volume, but a nasty, clangy, dominant overtone that is characteristic of cheap, stamped cymbals. At this price, the cast bronze cymbals pouring out of China are a much better choice: some of the same dark, shimmering qualities of the cast bronze Zildjians, without the tight QC standards or hand hammering.
Having said that, ZBTs came included with my kit, and have withstood a beating for almost 20 years. I can't imaging, who is cracking this cymbal. It's quite thick and flexible enough. Makes a nice trash cymbal now, with holes drilled and rivets.",0

There are no wiring diagrams for where the pickup wires need to connect. I had to use the information provided by other users on Amazon. After soldering everything, the sound is a slight improvement over what I previously had, but the HISS is terrible! This is without the Treble knob being turned up. If you turn up the Treble +12...my goodness! It's ridiculous. At least the previous preamp had no hiss. I wish I could go back to the original, but it's too much trouble for me at this point. I'll live with the crazy hiss, but I cannot use this bass for actual shows. I'll just use it for practice.",0

797,"So, I was really excited when this arrived.  I already had the old bridge off and ready for this to go on.  The screws that the bridge came with were a little smaller than the originals and didn't really grip, so no problem...I used the original ones.  Strung it up and gave it a quick tune...very close to being perfectly intonated right out of the box...a couple minor adjustments and everything was spot on.  Played it at a couple gigs with no issue, everybody was impressed with the tone (and the look).  Decided I'd like to change the string height a little...as soon as I touched the little allen screw on the saddle for the E-String...POP...it's stripped.  the entire side of the E saddle is now touching the base plate.  None of the threads will catch at all.  The screw looks to be in good shape, so I have to assume that the actual saddle is stripped inside, which means I can't just use a different screw to keep the E-String Saddle raised off the plate.  Now it's a useless bass until I get a new bridge.  At least it was cheap.  The height in the photo is as high as I can get that side of the saddle to go.",0

So just tonight a sat down for a few minutes to get a quick ear on this harmony magic box from TC Helicon.  Even with no effects, tone, or harmony turned on...it sounds way too over processed to me.  Almost like a strange doubling of your voice, and this of course making sure all the doubling, and all effects were indeed off.  Even tried mono instead of stereo which actually seems to sound a little better.  anyhoot, I tried all the preset channels turning off the effects/harmonies as i went...and still seem to get the same thing.  The harmonies are OK I suppose used very sparingly if you can stand the artificial sound of your regular voice.  The actual doubling feature sux, The tone feature sux, and pitch correction sux.  I'll give it a little more time, but it ain't lookin' good for the Helicon.  If the footswitches were quiter, I'd much rather have the Digitech Vocalist 3.",0

Its an extremely flat response mic, not dynamic at all. I'm sure it would work well for some type of plays or film works where a depressing, flat sound is best. I think they made it that way to reduce background noise, but regardless this mic does not sound great at all. It is accurate though, I'll give it that. But its just a boring mic. I don't really know how else to explain it. My vocals were a lot quieter than I would have liked, and they just sounded kind of dry and minimized before I threw on any special effects.",0

822,"Vater sticks are computer matched by pitch and weight AT the factory. For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.

In all fairness, this is the first time I've ever had this problem ordering sticks through Amazon. I've got 7 other pairs that were just fine before this - two of which were Vater sticks (Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood & Xtreme Design XD-5B Wood).

As far as Vater sticks when they aren't tampered with from the factory - great products. I've got the Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood Tip sticks already, and the size is great, I just need something a little sturdier when I'm on an acoustic set. These would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set.

Plus I had all ready drilled the ""pilot holes"" for the ""nubs"" that hold this tuner in place, Which means I was commited to useing ""only these tuners"" or replaceing the whole neck ! It may have been my fault only haveing inspected ( 2 ) of the tuners from the fitted box they come in, Amazon handeled this very professionally ! They over nighted another set the same day, Yes I got exactly the same thing as before ,and now are sending a (3rd) set , Yes I will have ( 6 ) of the same tuners this week sometime, again Amazon handeled this very well , even e-mailed U.P.S shipping labels so I do not have to pay returns, and again I am happy with all Amazon services !

834,"BEWARE! As another reviewer has stated, these are NOT genuine Fender celluloid guitar picks! Sadly when things are too good to be true, they usually are and this is one of those things. These are clearly made of a glossy, thicker plastic and not celluloid as advertised. These picks do not even come in official Fender packaging, rather a flimsy plastic zip lock with a laser printed sticker. Official fender grosses come in the typical clam shell packaging like the 12 packs. I had an original gross pack lying around here as I go through these like water and now I can't find it, but if I do I will post a picture. I've posted a pic of a 12 pack so you can see what the picks should come in when they are an official Fender product. Either way, these being sold here on Amazon in this listing are fakes and I am not happy. For one, I am not happy because this would have been a great deal on Fender picks and for two because this order was fulfilled by Amazon and not some other third party. Amazon, why are you selling me cheap knockoff BS as the real thing? What is going on here? Again, I have been playing guitar for almost 30 years and Fender Medium celluloid picks are the ONLY picks I use on a regular basis for recording and jamming and these are clearly NOT the real thing. If you don't care what your picks are made of, this might be a good deal for you on a giant bag of cheap glossy plastic picks... but if you are a serious player and are expecting the quality and feel, that only the original Fender celluloid pick can deliver, look elsewhere, you have been warned! I'm appalled...

As for the pictures I have posted; the picture on the left of the two individual picks, the one on the left is an official Fender Medium Celluloid and the one on the right is a shiny plastic pick that was sent to me. Notice that it's darker and a bit thicker. The original picks have a matte finish due to the way they are made and the material. The picks I received on the right are glossy and ""polished"", probably because they were tumbled unlike the fenders. The picture on the right, you see the cheap plastic bag I got from Amazon with their laser printed label. The clam shell 12 pack is original Fender packaging. I know these still come in grosses in the clam shell because I still buy them this way locally, albeit at a higher price. So, yes Fender does still manufacture the gross and sell it in the official packaging. Hope this helps someone out.",0

Yes, I could have treated the unit better, but I'd bet that a lot of folks open it the way I did.

IN ANY CASE, it no longer works now. There wasn't a moment when i felt like i broke it, i just tried to use it one day and it failed. The lock on the legs has failed and it will no longer do it's job to hold my guitar up. Therefore, I still will be buying a stand that can stand the test of time (and my ownership).

You need to stop the loop to save it (unlike the Jamman Stereo) and even more importantly, you CANNOT switch between loops smoothly! As perfect as you time your recording, there is always a 1/2 second gap between loops, so unless you like your songs with 1/2 second cuts, buy something else. Sent it back the day after I received it...terrible...not intuitive, tracks need to be the same length (not ""independent"" as they say). doesn't come with a power supply, is glitchy...all in all, find a better looper. Jamman Stereo is the one I got instead and it is such a relief.",0

861,"Frankly, I don't like this - I don't know why they mentioned ""tune-o-matic"" in the description.  I had expected this to be a drop-in for the tune-o-matic on my Epiphone Sheraton II.  The main problem is that the posts that came with it are too small.  One post that it came with had to be forced into the too small openings of the bridge.  But these are way too be compatible with the existing tune-o-matic posts.  OK, so I can just use the replacement ones it came with?  Nope, I pulled one of mine out of the guitar wood and these are just a *way* too small to fitting in that hole.  I would have had to fill the old hole with wood and redrill new smaller ones.

Instead, since I waited almost 50 days to get these in the mail from China, I used a 15/64"" drill and made the openings bigger.  Of course, they don't have the back and forth travel that they were supposed to have, but at least it would work.  My Epiphone Sheraton II (from Amazon!) didn't have enough travel to correctly set the intonation.

After getting the holes drilled, I realized this has some serious design flaws.  #1 is that the screws can go into the left or right side.  But they're not centered within the box holder so that if you put the wheel on the left, it must use the right side screw hole.  This severely limits the travel that you'd theoretically get.  They should have tapped a hole in the middle as well (which I would do if needed) so that I could push the wheels all the way to either side.  As it is, there is considerable overlap in the two screw positions, limiting the amount of offset you can create (and putting more reliance on being able to move the whole saddle left/right.

Second, it's very hard to turn the screws once this is in place because the screws are now under the strings (see picture).  You can muscle the strings off to the side and loosen and tighten them, but not very convenient.  At least with the string down pressure they don't go anywhere.  The pieces that hold the wheels are too tight side-to-side in my opinion (not enough play between them and you have to whack them to move them back and forth with the screw loosened).  Not the right tolerance in widths of the box in my opinion.

Lastly, the set screws that hold the bridge to the posts are not straight in and frankly don't have visual appeal.  This bridge is strictly utilitarian.  Had I used the narrow posts, these set screws would be essential, but for the drilled hole, probably not necessary.  I believe they should have made the ends of the bridge bigger, with more metal, and allowed the set screws to recess.

In conclusion, it's a great idea, just not executed very well.  Still, if you're cheap and can use a drill, this might work for you.  I'm leaving this on my guitar for now, but I'm tempted to just fill the wood hole in my guitar and move the original bridge slightly away to correct my original problem.  We'll see.",0

874,"I hate to do this, but I agree that this looper is overrated.

Pros:
1. It can be configured to do all kinds of different behaviors.
2. It can sync to a midi time signal.

Cons:
1. The interface is terrible. Steve Jobs would have personally flown to Pigtronix's offices to slap someone if he had ever seen this. It's really quite tricky to use. You can get used to it and do cool stuff, but it's a really steep learning curve.
2. The requirement to use a separate stomp box for undo is ridiculous. Undo functionality isn't an option and requiring a separate box makes it so this box takes up too much room to realistically ever want on your pedalboard.
3. The through signal is not totally dry. There's a master output volume knob (and I really can't understand why). You have to fiddle with that to try to get unity gain and even still, I suspect it's coloring my signal.
4. As others have stated, the build quality is disappointing.
5. Bugs. I've had it crash on me a million times and get all kinds of more minor bugs.
6. This probably falls into the bug category, but I get unpredictable sound quality. Sometimes it's great, other times it's scratchy and terrible. Like I said, this probably results from software bugs rather than hardware issues.

For this price, I believe they could afford to build something much more high tech and with a much easier interface. The hardware for a touchscreen just doesn't cost much anymore. And adding delay would have cost nothing.

It's worth noting that I bought this to replace my TC Flashback X4, but it's my X4 that's stayed on my pedalboard. Even with both devices hooked up, I find myself reaching to the X4 looper most of the time. It's just easier and more reliable.

Also, my X4 runs on 9v and has delay built-in. So to replace it with the Pigtronix Infinity, I need to find space for the looper itself, the undo switch, and a separate delay pedal. I just don't have that much real estate to work with. And because it runs on 18v, I would go from needing 1 power jack to needing 3 (2 to supply 18v to the Infinity Looper and 1 to supply a separate delay pedal).

It was a super thoughtful gift, but sadly it hasn't really worked out.",0

My amp and computer both show no activity when I strum or pick a string. I guess it serves me right for trying to cheap out and getting a cheap pickup for my cheap guitar. I'd remove it, but it would be difficult to remove and I'd never be able to put my guitar back to the way it was because I had to enlarge the endpin hole. Besides that, it's more hassle than it's worth to return it even if I did decide to remove it because it was so cheap. My advice? Skip this product, try something else.",0

892,"Compared to the Snark&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snark-SN-1-Tuner/dp/B003VWJ2K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snark SN-1 Tuner</a>&nbsp;tuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.

The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. I just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way.",0

897,"This microphone comes with two cables.  One allow you to connect it with a USB port to a laptop/PC/Mac; and one that allows you to connect it to an iPhone/iPod/iPad with a lighting to micro USB cable.

1) the Micro USB cable will stop working after a week or two.  NO ONE sells the replacement cable except iRig on its own website for $29.99

2) Whilst connected to a computer, you will hear a lot of distortion in the mic.  Yes, it is much better than the computer's own microphone, but it is not good for a microphone of this price.  I have Yeti microphones that sound much better.  Distortion gains considerably if you use the gain button

3) the microphone does not have an off button.  If you encounter feedback, you have to immediately unplug or use the gain knob, which is very inconvenient to use -you have to depress with your thumb to turn it.

Given it fails to reliably connect to an iPad/iPhone, and the mediocre acoustics, I cannot give it a better rating than 2 stars.

The Yeti products sound good as well, but have their own flaws.  I have had two go bad just after two years (just after warranty period), with micro USB connectors going bad.

First the positives:

- Looks great
- nice, easy to read display
- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs
- the clip seems sturdy
- tuner is compact
- nice price

Now the significant disappointment:

- inaccurate

The settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...

I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...

906,"I know there are a lot of positive reviews on this stand, but I am not a fan!  Just to qualify my review, I am a frequently gigging musician in a band, not as a solo acoustic artist.

I find the center pole becomes unstable if you need to extend the stand. As you get close to the end of each vertical section, the section will start to wobble within the stand no matter how you much you tighten the stops. If you can use it with each section extended no more than 50%, then it is much more stable. I don't think this would be a problem if you sit to play and can place the mic stand directly in front of you.

The tripod width-adjusting legs at the base are easily pulled completely out of the stand. It's a pain to fit them back in, especially if your setup it running later than you'd like. Also, getting each at the exact same length, to help make the stand not lean from perpendicular, is difficult. It would be MUCH better to have a 'click-stop' system, or at least length markings (which I scribed into mine) rather than having to eye-ball the extensions for equivalent lengths.

One other problem I have had is when I use the boom extended and also put the AirTurn Manos iPad holder on the same side of the stand. Unless you are careful how you position the tripod base legs, the stand will tip from the weight. I use an Audix OM2 mic, which weights only about as much as a Shure SM57, and a standard 10"" iPad.

The stand and boom are very light and does pack into a very small space when transporting, but I have gone back to a solid Ultimate Support mic stand in all cases except very cramped stages and ONLY when I know nothing will bump into the stand. I do sometimes use just the stand attached directly to the Manos (ie. not with the side-arm support) and it works great. But I would not recommend this stand for holding a mic with an extended boom, especially when the stand has to be vertically extended past 4 ft, or if you need the boom extended and also attach an iPad to the stand.",0

912,"I have compared this Yamaha recorder to an Adler wooden soprano recorder.  There are many differences between the two instruments.

First of all the Adler recorder has a richer softer more mellow tone compared to the louder more piercing tone of this instrument.  The two instruments are also made in separate countries.  The Adler is made in Germany, whereas the Yamaha is made in China.  The two instruments are also encased differently.  The Adler comes in a blue and white Velcro case.  The Yamaha comes in a cheap plastic case with a hard to close snap.

Both of these instruments have Baroque fingering.  For the most part, they both play each note in tune, except for one. The F note on the Yamaha recorder is actually F sharp.  Not so on the Adler.  If you have a recorder student in your household who is learning to play the instrument for the first time, this recorder is fine for that.

Got mine from a studio as new and out of the box the unit was defective. Many of the presets did not work out of the box and required twicking. Mic (EV RE-20) did not work initially until I set the sensitivity of the mic up to high in setup. The Mic Gain knob was non-functional. Two techs confirmed that no factory reset or firmware would fix this. One tech admitted that the defective mic gain potentiometer is a big problem with these units. Latest software per TC Helicon' site is 1.2 but my unit was 1.21. Latest firmware per TC Helicon's site is 1.07 but mine was 1.09. TC had no comment on those discrepancies. Volume kicked out on me after 15 minutes and when I went into setup and toggled several times between 44.1 and 48 sample rates the volume came back.
Not sure if the version discrepancies had anything to do with the preset issues but my VoiceLive 2 worked right out of the box with little or no twicking. TC Helicon should have taken care with their default settings to make them more universally usable as the VoiceLive 2 did. One example was the Leslie harmony ... mic pickup was drowned out by a very loud speaker noise that I have never heard in any Leslie speaker I have been around. TC suggested dropping or changing the distortion setting. I did that but that preset was unusable for the studio.
Bypass did not work in stage mode. Sometimes going into settings and toggling the bypass setting between stage and studio would get bypass working again. Last time I tried to fix this only studio would work in bypass mode so I just left the unit in studio bypass mode.

And the logistics of operating a one-pedal looper, one with several tiny buttons that require you to repeatedly stoop down and squint at the controls -- is more frustration that it's worth.

You can Google search for CAD u37 latency and you'll see many discussions and complaints covering this topic.

946,"**UPDATE: 12/11/2016 (I have to update this since I just purchased an additional DDJ-SR component.  Unlike the other ones I have, the newest DDJ-SR didn't work properly right out of the box.  Our other DDJ-SR units still work without issues). Please disregard my opening statement as it is no longer valid.  Pioneer may be having quality control problems.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm not understanding the positive reviews.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I don't get it.  First of all, I own a DJ company and have been using Serato DJ for several years now for my DJ units.  We use the Pioneer DDJ-SR for our main units as well as the Numark NS7's.  I've never had issues like I did with the DDJ-SB2.  I purchased two DDJ-SB2 units as practice pads for my DJ staff and downloaded the Serato DJ Intro software.  The software crashes all of the time while using this controller.  I don't know if it's the software or the controller (DDJ-SB2) but regardless, it doesn't work with my laptops (any of them).  My laptops are very high grade and I know they're compatible.  I know this because they run the regular Serato DJ software just fine with my DDJ-SR's.  They also have quad 2.0 Intel processors and 1.5 TB hard drives.  We do have a huge library but it only takes up about 65% of the HD space.  Neither DDJ-SB2 units would function without crashing the software.  We tried this on all of our laptops and even removed all essential software except Serato DJ Intro.  When it worked, which was only for a moment before crashing, it would take about 2-3 minutes to load a Serato Crate after clicking on it.  We ended up taking the Serato DJ Intro software off and returned our computers to how they were before (with Serato DJ to work with the DDJ-SR units and NS7's).  My staff couldn't figure it out either.  I don't know if I should blame Serato DJ Intro or Pioneer but either way, these units failed us and I've wasted too much of my time to care whose fault this is or why the software or hardware doesn't work with $2000 laptops.",0
947,Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it.,0

The tempo has to be dialed in manually and is not storable as per patch. But I could live with that if it had decent samples. Some may very well like the samples, mostly pop and heavy rock oriented. My music preference is more dynamic in nature so this is barely usable for me. I'll be selling it.",0

These are rated in the description to support 110lbs and all of the parts, except the base, are heavy duty enough to support weight but then they attach it to a base that cannot support anything.  Poorly engineered.

I knew, from reviews here, that the finish would be poor with sharp edges so that was expected and not a problem for me.  But these are completely not functional since they use one bolt to attach the vertical tube to a thin piece of sheet metal that bends and crushes if you put any pressure on it at all.

These would work fine (sort of) for small monitors under 20 pounds - but even with small speakers the base will keep loosening up because every vibration or flex will crush the tube that the bolt is tightened thru and then the bolt will be loose again.  You can keep tightening the bolt and it would just crush the tube completely flat (and then it wouldn't support anything at all).  So that is the serious design flaw that makes these worthless.  You might as well get smaller and better looking stands if you are using smaller speakers.

If  you welded a solid metal socket to the base - or if they had put a metal spacer inside the tube so the bolt can be tightened without crushing the tube .... but they didn't.",0

965,"I bought this because of the good reviews and because my 6 string acoustic guitar did not have two mounts. However as soon as it arrived and I saw it, I knew I was going to have to send it back. Here's why:

- The material is stiff and remains folded from when it was packaged (polypropylene?)
- The shoelace attachment method looks bad and gets in the way of the neck.
- I don't like the design of the end pieces (yes, I know, personal preference)

Here's what I ended up doing instead:
- Bought an inexpensive nylon strap&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Protec-Guitar-Strap-with-Leather-Ends-and-Pick-Pocket-Black/dp/B0009G1E0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Protec Guitar Strap with Leather Ends and Pick Pocket, Black</a>

- Installed the hardware (I drilled a hole in the base of the neck and installed the other mount there. Took 5 minutes.)

The result is amazing. The neck is now completely unobstructed as the strap attaches where the neck meets the body. It's a neat setup that looks fantastic. And the strap is secure and won't fall off. And it is amazingly comfortable. The strap caresses you like your girlfriend.

I got my Palmer Guitar for free, but even at that price, I just couldn't bear putting the On Stage Guitar Strap on it. The setup that I went with is so slick that I feel like a professional. Sure, it costs about $25, but IMHO, it's worth every penny.",0
966,"UPDATE 08/11/16: Decided to give these another shot hoping that they have fixed their issues. I wish I wouldn't have. Opened up the pack and the strings looked like had already been used, they were full of kinks and bends. I was really hoping that they had fixed their quality control issue, but its looks to of only gotten worse. As a regularly gigging musician, I need strings I can trust and these just will not make the grade. Its a shame too, because I absolutely loved them when I first started using them,

I been using these for a while and loved them. The last set I put on, I had 3 different strings break in 3 shows. -  g string was no surprises other than it broke after 2 hrs.

974,"I bought this thing for my Fender acoustic which is my first and only guitar that I've played on for 6 years now. It doesn't have a pickup built into it. As I started getting involved in the worship ministry at church, I needed some way to amplify my acoustic sound. Because I'm a regular bassist, I didn't want to invest too much into a new acoustic-electric (although I would love one). And micing the guitar was nice but inefficient because I move around a lot when I lead worship. So I did some researching and came across this pickup. I took people's words for it and bought it. The pickup works. But it picks up waay too little signal. When I plug it into a DI, I literally have to put the gain up 95% of the way and then crank it up in my monitor to hear my guitar. And because the gain is so high, I get unnecessary noise.  I plugged it into my bass amp and same deal, gotta crank it up real high to actually hear my acoustic. However, aside from the noise, it sounds pretty nice with right EQing and compression. For now, I'm gonna stick to just micing it with a 57. Sounds way better.

So I don't know if mine is just a dud or if this pickup is just poorly built.",0

Another disappointment was that the mic I received had been used. The box had torn open by some previous owner. The documentation was missing as was the shockmount, and mic clip that was supposed to be included. Mic was covered with greasy finger prints, and a battery had been left in it.

I recently received a new PRS CE24, and the volume knob seemed as if it had a tad of play in it, so very gently I checked to see if the tool would fit underneath the volume knob to snug up the nut.  I used virtually no pressure just to see if it would fit underneath, and when I realized it wouldn't quite fit, I removed it and it had left 5-6 scuff marks around the base of the knob on the pristine finish of my new guitar!  The tool is actually abrasive.  It is polished on the top side, where no contact is made with your finish, but the bottom side is not.  It feels smooth when you run your finger along the bottom, but if you use your fingernail, you can immediately feel the abrasive finish.  I wasted my money on this piece of garbage, and through my own stupidity did not test it on a surface of no concern first.

It isn't; it's barely long enough for alto sax or a tenor played by a small person. Second, it's not quickly adjustable; if you play only one instrument, that wouldn't matter, but a strap at this price should be more practically designed. Third and most important, the clip is plastic junk! It won't stand up to professional or avid amateur use for long. And it's too fat! The hook won't slip into the typical metal eyes on most instruments, or it slips in only partially and therefore insecurely. Look for something else, musician friends!

I had already downloaded Audacity 2.1.3 and some VST plug-ins, but I would like to have the rest of the additional software as well.
Not sure how well this will do to transfer another low-latency track while hearing a playback of my previous tracks.
I still think I will have to play the song back from another device through my Behringer 808 mixer with headphones, then record another instrument and manually align the tracks according to wavelength spikes just to line them up.
Professional computer soundboards are in the $1,000's of dollars.
But just one extra simultaneous track would be nice.

1003,"Edited review: OK, I'm leaving my original review intact below. However, after the better part of a year playing constantly through the CP-12, I've begun to sour on it. While I've mostly limped along on this thing since my ""essential"" CTO-1 died, I could just never quite get the edge or bite out of this pedal that I could get out of my old CTO-1; I'm sure a real Timmy has the transparent edge (and bite) on both devices.

Worse, the CP-12 has recently begun misbehaving in a bizarre way that made me think I was losing my mind for a couple of rehearsals in a row. Symptom: as the pedal is left on over the course of minutes, the gain SLOWLY begins to grow in the direction of increasingly distorted, ill-defined, buzzy fuzzmush without increasing in volume... almost like I'm dealing with a dying battery, except I'm powering this thing off of a standard-issue Dunlop 9v wall wart. At the last rehearsal it got so uncontrollably horrid that I had to yank the thing out of my signal chain altogether.

I REALLY like getting sleeper deals, and I stand by my statement that this is a good ""gateway pedal"" to the Timmy thing... but sometimes you get what you pay for, and so I'm off to sell some plasma or something and finally get the real Timmy I've obviously been needing for years anyway. Frankly, I'd now sort of recommend that if you like the Timmy demos and whatever else you may have heard, you just go ahead and do the same. It's a screaming deal for a great pedal and if you don't like it, even with the increase in Timmy supply in recent years, it seems from looking around like you can still resell the thing for basically what you paid.

***

I have used a Danelectro Cool Cat CTO-1 Transparent Overdrive for several years as *the* cornerstone of my tone in several bands. This pedal was famously cloned from the Paul C Timmy; Dano got caught in the act and ""voluntarily"" dropped the pedal. A few weeks ago my CTO-1 got destroyed in an incident involving multiple amps and bad stage grounding, and of course you can't get the CTO-1 any more (I used to have a small stockpile of CTO-1s but I stupidly sold them all off, and the currently-produced CTO-2 sounds nothing at all like the CTO-1).

My CTO-1 basically never goes off when I'm plugged in and had to be replaced immediately. I knew I should just finally go buy a Timmy but money is even more tight now than it was when I first got my CTO-1, so I thought I'd try the Pure Sky. It got to the US in about a week and a half.

Compared to the CTO-1 the Pure Sky is in fact very similar but noticeably lacking just a bit of sparkle / edge / life. It also seems to have somewhat less gain / breakup available on tap than the CTO-1 - 50% / high noon on the Pure Sky's gain control, or at least on the Pure Sky *I* got, is about where I'd be ca. 25-30% / 9, 10 o'clock-ish on the CTO-1.

None of this is to say that the Sky sounds bad at all. It's a very good, quiet, transparent OD that has tons of clean boost and sounds good by itself or before / after other distortion boxes. It's just somehow not as immediately whoa-inspiring as the CTO-1 (nor, presumably, the Timmy) in stock form, even though you can tell they're both very much in the same family.

I've opened the box, haven't traced out the circuit of the CP-12, but it definitely looks at first glance like it is very heavily based on the v1 Timmy per the schematic I have. The single opamp chip on my CP-12 is socketed; this is neat, as it enables you to try out some different opamps in place of the (unlabeled / sanded-off) factory issue.

(Edit: My original posted review suggested the CP-12 might be a good suggested mod platform for beginning to intermediate DIYers - I have found further online / anecdotal evidence to suggest that maybe the Caline pedals *aren't* so great for that, mostly because the double-sided ""value-priced"" PCBs therein may be prone to lifting / disintegrating lugs and traces when a hobbyist tries to solder / desolder components after the sale. So, review edited. The pedal does look reasonably constructed inside, and the socketed IC *can* be a source of fun if YOUR unit is also socketed. But you may not want to plan on easily being able to swap in diodes / ""audiophile-grade"" caps / whatever without also potentially replacing the entire PC board.)

Bottom line, if you don't already have something like a Timmy in your arsenal, the Pure Sky is a great way to find out what everyone's talking about. However, if you can possibly find another hundred bucks and already know you want ""the Timmy sound,"" just go for the real deal... although the Sky would definitely make a fine backup, or ""Timmy-upon-Timmy stacker"" option, for barely more than the price of a used DS-1. I'll probably be picking up a few more Calines in the future.",1

1013,"This is shiny and provides storage and dual sitting places.  Looks very good.  My wife loves the way it looks in the living room.  However, this bench doesn't strike me as being heavy-duty or resistant to the least abuse.  I have another bench I bought for my upstairs piano that is not so fancy, doesn't have storage, doesn't seat two comfortably, but strikes me as being more sturdy.  It's the On Stage KT  800 Keyboard Bench.  I would give the On Stage one five stars because I like it's stability and durability.  For example, I would stand on the On Stage bench; I would not stand on this one.  There are obviously trade offs.

Update:  I have recently posted a YouTube video comparison of this piano bench with the On Stage Stands KT 7800.  After having used the TMS bench for a month now, I take away a star or two for comfort and durability. Here's the title of my video if you'd like to check it out:  On Stage Stands Piano bench, KT 7800 and the TMS Black Ebony Piano Bench.

1014,"I bought the 10 foot Candy Apple Red cable from Amazon. I wanted something bright to differentiate from the other cables onstage. Unboxing the cable I found the outer jacket hard and it doesn't lie down flat because of lack of elasticity. The ends are well made but because of the overall appearance and stiffness I wouldn't gig with this and it especially wouldn't look good onstage. But hey, let's face it-- it is a $9.99 cable with free Prime shipping. If you're a beginner and on a budget this cable will work for you.

I'm going to work at flexing it and will use it at home because I need a short home practice cable. If you can only afford this cable it will work ok for home use if you work at flexing it. But don't buy it intending on using it onstage. You could take a fall tripping over it.",1

However, the guitar was in playable condition. I did like the sound and I was already wanting to make a custom guitar so I sanded the guitar down super glued the wood together and designed it the way I wanted. Had it not been for already being interested in a project like this I would have absolutely returned this guitar and never looked back.",1

I suppose they are great if you just need a place to safely store your guitar when you aren't playing it..but if you are looking for something to mount your guitar on for decorative purposes, I wouldn't suggest buying this. The vertical string swing is more low profile, and that's what we ended up using instead. I ended up giving these ones to my nephew who plays guitar and has several of them:)",1

I noticed that these strings were not as bright and they didn't have that nice ""ringing"" tone that the original strings provided. My Martin sounded lifeless.  I then installed a set of Ernie Ball 2150 Earthwood Phosphor Bronze strings. The brightness and the fun is back.
I know that Elixer makes great strings. They sound great on my electrics. But, these Polywebs just didn't work out on my particular acoustic guitar.  Keep in mind that my rating is for the Polywebs as they sound on my particular guitar. Your results may vary.  Next time, I might try the Elixer Nanowebs which are supposed to sound brighter.",1

1039,"I bought this device with the hope of using it as an interface for a controller and iPhone in live music situations. I have an iPhone 5 with the most current updates, and I downloaded the IK sample tank app which costs 20 dollars if you want the good stuff. You also have to download an iRig app which I suppose tells the phone to accept the midi signal. This is where the problem occurs. I played around with this a little and the iRig app freezes up quite often if you try to do anything with it. You have to restart your phone or device before being able to use any of the sample tank software. This made me very reluctant to use it in a live situation where you have to rely on it for a performance. Restarting your iPhone in the middle of a set because it has all of your keyboard patches would be totally embarrassing to say the least. After getting everything running smoothly, I was able to play around with the patches in sample tank except that some of the patches have a very lofi degraded quality. I do not know the reason for this, but it seems like the piano patches required more processing power maybe since that is where I noticed it most often. The synth and pad patches sounded fine however. I think this will be fun for practicing or playing around the house or with records, but I wouldn't trust it live. I have always wanted a hammond or drawbar module, and this enables me to use an iPad for that purpose with garageband and it only costs a little bit of money.",1
1040,Almost immediately one of the telescoping locks stopped working. It's not a HUGE deal but it's a bummer. It's very sturdy but the locking rings all feel not so great and secure. If I had to use this on a daily basis I would probably look for a different boom pole.,1

1043,"Mediocre strings with mediocre tone. Bright, un-nuanced and uninspiring tone. I don't know how these strings get such high remarks, there is way too much high end harshness in the strings that overwhelm the voice of the guitar and overwhelm the natural warmth of the wood. The phosphor bronze strings sound much better with more body, shimmer, bass and feel. The only upside to this string is that there is less tension with lower action than the Phosphor Bronze strings and sits ""lower"" on the fret board than the Phosphor strings. I dislike the sound of these strings but don't mind the feel.",1
1044,"This is a very attractive, but light duty case.  Here are my observations:

Cons:  Padding is on the light side.  The perimeter of the case (sides) that holds the body of the guitar has about 1/2 inch of padding.  There is a rectangular piece of padding in the bottom and a diamond shaped piece of padding in the top of the case to secure the body of the guitar.  The neck is secured by a thin wooden block at the 11th fret (of my Gibson LP) and there is a small piece of padding on the top of the case located just above the neck block.  The neck block itself seems to have about 1/16th of an inch of padding on it to protect the neck.  My guitar neck free floats in the case above the 11th fret.  It doesn't touch any of the case even when closed.  Also the padding in the neck area of the case is very thin.  Nothing like what was used in the body portion of the case.  Not sure why they skimped on padding in this end of the case.  The case itself is thin and you can push it in with your fingers.  I wouldn't recommend laying anything on top of it.

Pros:  It is a nice looking case that is different from all of the other cases out there.  The finish is nice and all of the hardware is secure and functions as expected.  There is plenty of length at the head stock to hold an Epiphone version of the LP style guitar.  The body of the guitar seems to be pretty well protected.

For the money there are better options out there that are cheaper and offer more protection.  This case will be used around the house and for short trips to friends homes to jam.  I would never consider letting anyone else handle my guitar while it is in this case.  I have other suitable hard cases for travel so this isn't a deal breaker for me.  I will probably add some egg crate foam to the neck area and spray the exterior with some Scotch Guard.",1
1045,"I am not a beginner, but neither am I a very good guitar player.  I bought the Jamstick+ primarily to practice so I wouldn't have to drag out the telecaster every time I wanted to practice certain scales/chords, etc.  Well, it's not for me...I need a full fret board.  I don't like have to try certain chords with the distance between the chords being so large, the way they are in the first five frets...plus, how to quickly go up and down the scale...no, no, no.  I tried a couple of the practice runs on my iPad...for fretting...and I thought it was a fun excercise to learn the notes and jump from string to string without error...but again, there you are, limited to five frets.  I called the company and I am going to return it but if they ever come out with a model with a full fretboard, and also away to vary the speed of the exercises, then this would be a good and convenient way to practice.  There are many things about the tutoring that I liked...but not with only five frets.  By the way, I had an initial issue installing the buttons for the strap.  One side went in without a hitch...the other side was very difficult but after several attempts and a lot of strength the button did snap into place.",1
1046,"For the price you really can't complain. The metal used is good quality. All the plastic knuckles and brackets make it fragile. Anyone that's owned tripods or any of these type of products know that you have to be careful not to drop them. I've leaned them walls and they've slid down and broke the plastic tighteners off. This trussing system is very solid when built. It holds plenty of lighting (the new LED lighting) I wouldn't suggest a bunch of the older heavier lighting at least in the middle. The tripods are really sturdy. the downside is that the American DJ O-Clamps don't tighten on the truss system, the poles are a little to thin but with some gaff tape it helps it out. This is a decent product for the mobile dj. i wouldn't suggest for a tour..lol",1
1047,Purchased these cables to connect my speakers to a Pioneer DJ Controller and a USB Audio Interface. From the very beginning I got  intolerable interference. Loud popping and hissing noises when moving my mouse around and changing tabs on my computer. The noise only goes away when audio is being played. I returned the cables and purchased some shielded cables for double the price which fixed the noise issues entirely. No problems with returning.,1
1048,"Took it out of the box, set it on the floor and no matter where/how I angled it, it wobbles. 3 stars,  but, if you look at my picture of the bottom of the item, you'll see there are 5 rubber bumpers screwed in.  So to fix the wobble, you can either;

Take off the middle rubber bumper, leave it off - maybe it won't bow in the middle.
Take off the middle rubber bumper and sand it down a few mm then replace the now 'shorter' rubber bumper.

So when you step/stomp it doesn't wobble, but still supports the middle.  Other than that, its a pretty good pedal board.

The included power supply is very small and comes with an extension so you can daisychain 6 pedals at 1700mA it should be more than enough.  There are no channels for the wires so make sure you toss some velcro wire ties in your new bag.

The bag is just what it is, a bag, there is no padding and the seams seem weak, the handles are stitched all the way down the bag so at least they won't just come off as you carry it.  (See my pictures)

Pros;
Inexpensive
Seems Sturdy
Lots of room
Power Supply is handy so you don't need tons of wall-warts in your bag (but be sure you carry xtra batteries anyway)

Con;
Wobbles (can be adjusted, but why should I have to)
Bag seems weak, no padding - time will tell but you get what you paid for, and it really was just tossed in.

P.S. store your pedals in the bag, but don't forget to unplug the daisy chains or your batteries will die!",1

1053,"So, first off, change the description from ""yellow"", to orange. Because the one I got is orange. I opted to give it three stars because I felt two was unfair because I didn't bother giving it a proper fret job. The neck needed to be shimmed in the neck pocket to get the angle right, which is perfectly normal for even high quality 3rd party necks. But after I got the angle set with the shims, the buzz and dead frets were so bad, I  didn't even bother prepping it for levelling. I tried adjusting the truss rod, and from what I could tell, it did nothing. In the end, I just put on a Grover nut to convert it for playing slide. That's probably how I'll leave it. I don't want money back because I will use the product. And I don't want a replacement. I just don't. I need a slide guitar anyway.",1

Hard to get a bend with your fingers. I think i will go back to the 9s because they just feel better to me. The DR Pure Blues nickel strings i have on my Strat are very nice strings.",1
1058,"A lot of functionality on a very affordable pedal.  The 3 way switch between tape, digital, and analog is great! It can go from warm analog delay to crisp digital repeats.  The tap tempo is another great feature on such a cheap pedal.  My only complaint about it is when it's plugged into your signal chain it sucks a lot of tone from you.  It would be wise to pair it with a BBE sonic stomp.  Overall if you are looking to not break the bank and get very decent delay and lots of versatility I would highly recommend this pedal!",1

The board is reasonably well-done with V3102 clock generator and a matching V3207 BBD analog delay chips and several opamps.

This is very common and there a number of writeups on the internet about how disassemble the thing and turn a tiny pcb mounted potentiometer just a little bit to increase the gain (volume) of the effect.

1068,"Bought this thinking that I could consolidate amplifiers. Although this is far better than the Mustang 1 by Fender it should not be promoted as being a multi-instrument amp, at least when it comes to bass. A bass, particularly with preamp, will send this poor thing screaming with vibration even at modest tones. Don't buy if you think that you can use for your bass. Just can't handle it. Low E a killer. Low B a death sentence.

Now the good. Great selection of features and tones. Controls reasonably straight forward. Speaker more than enough for a guitar. Compact and solidly constructed.

Not so sure about Transtube technology. Not bad but it still sounds like solid state to me. My Valve Jr makes this sound like a toy.

 If you have the right stand it might be perfect.
Check the size- it's large enough for me, for a DI box, picks, capo etc,  but won't hold a bunch of stuff. About 1/2"" lip- enough to hold flat items in place, but roundish percussion instruments might roll off easily.",1
1074,"I, like another reviewer here, use this on my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp, and while it does allow you to crank up your amp, it takes out some of the toneful goodness that the amp has without it. The crispness and definition that my Paul Reed Smith has normally is sucked out of the output.  I also notice that most of the attenuation is in the last (first?) 5% of the travel of the limiting knob, so if you're really trying to play quietly but have your amp cranked way up, you'll be doing some fine adjusting.  I don't play out anymore, so I can't comment on the relevancy of any of the issues I've brought up if you need to limit your volume while performing, but I can tell when it's plugged in and when it's not when I'm trying to play fairly quietly.",1
1075,It seems OK for an Electric Guitar but good luck installing these on the back end pin of an Acoustic Electric Guitar.,1
1076,"Wireless *does* work with the DR-40, sort of... but at a short range and not very reliably. The design packaging is a bit puzzling, but I suspect the reasoning behind it is mostly marketing.  This works directly with the DR-100 as a wireless remote, as that model recorder has an IR receiver built in; the DR-40 does not. The IR sensor is sort of hidden inside the top of the cradle.

It appears Tascam intends this work only as a wired remote for the DR-40, given the placement of the IR receiver inside the cradle. You can take the remote out of the cradle, but distance and angle are tricky. The reception angle of the receiver makes it very difficult to use the remote wirelessly outside of the cradle. At first I thought this was just clumsy design- it would be very easy to include an additional IR sensor inside the cradle and have the top section of the cradle pass IR light to the sensor, or a prism or mirror and exterior lens. But as I said, it appears Tascam doesn't want us to be able to do this wirelessly without purchasing the more expensive DR-100 model.

I was hoping to be able to place my recorder on a mic stand or suspend it from the ceiling to capture my band live, and use this remote from the stage to start recording. I'd like to get the recorder out in the room where we can capture the mix through the mains just as the audience hears us. The only time I've managed to record us is when I've connected it to the mixing board and the sound guy remembered to hit record. If left to me, I usually forget to hit record until we're already playing. The wired cord isn't long enough for my intended use, and even if extended would prove fairly inconvenient in a live setting. Wireless is key for my needs.

It would be nice if a proper IR receiver were available to provide this functionality. Since Tascam hasn't seen fit to provide that accessory for the DR-40, I intend to attempt to make this very thing myself by repackaging the board out of the top section of the cradle, and sourcing a shorter 2.5mm stereo patch cable. I tried using the board out of the cradle by itself (very simple to remove), but angle and distance were still a bit of an issue. I was able to get it to work at about 20', but it was a bit difficult. I'll update my review if I get it to work by putting it small project case with a visible light filtering IR lens. I read somewhere frosted scotch tape on the receiver lens helps with the angle issue too. If this works, I'll just attach it to the recorder with some double stick velcro.",1
1077,"This guitar is alright for a camping trip or something of that nature. The way people rave about how much they love it in these customer reviews is somewhat misleading. So I thought I would post a more realistic review. This guitar doesn't sound very good. It has a boxy, cheap sounding tone. Similar to a lower end Sears Silvertone model. It also has that same kind of cheap look, which is somewhat cool if you are into that. The size is pretty small, which is a plus for some people and a minus for others. Bottom line I don't mind owning it and probably won't give it away, but if I knew then, what I know now, I most likely wouldn't have bought it in the first place.",1

Girls, especially, go nuts over them, and want their own!!  I'm not even kidding about that.  For that fact alone, you should buy a pair.  You don't have to use them all night...just now and then, you'll  be amazed at the response of the audience.",1
1081,"I bought this chorus pedal because it was inexpensive. The chorus effects are okay on this unit. To my ear it has a tendency to sound more synthesized/digital than I like, and hopefully in time I can dial in a better sound with it. It works perfectly well for what I need though, which is playing at my church once a month, but if I were more serious than that I would probably spring for a different chorus pedal. That being said, for ~$20 it's not a bad deal for a guy like me. But if and when I make any upgrades to my pedal board, this will probably be the first thing to go.",1
1082,"A good moderately priced guitar stand.
I had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result I replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware store.
A good moderately priced guitar stand. I would recommend purchasing it.",1
1083,"This device is designed to allow you to input audio from multiple sources to your computer, mix it as you like and record it using whatever recording software you have.

If all you need to record is voice input, you might be better of just getting a decent USB mike. The mike included here is not high end, but it's decent, and you can, of course replace the mike with whatever one you prefer. (It does come with a cable that will input from an XLR device.)

But if you want to record, say, voice and an instrument and maybe even background music, all at the same time, this is an easy and fairly cost effective solution.

It's not quite as easy as they seem to suggest, though. The instructions included show you how to set it up, but very little else. If you want to get the most use out of it, you have to download software from Creative's website, which allows you to adjust a range of settings, including the balance between the various inputs, before recording.

I didn't find the software to be entirely intuitive, though. One thing I find annoying is that the program won't even turn on unless you have the Sound Blaster plugged in, and it doesn't recognize it right away. So, I'll plug it in, then try to load up the program, get an error message saying it doesn't detect an appropriate device and that it will shut down, and then have to restart the software to get it to work. I have also never been able to get the mixer to work. I can have both the voice mike and the instrument mike plugged in, and I click on the mixer tab, and both the ""Instrument Mic/Line-in"" and the ""Vocal Mic"" are greyed out so that I can't adjust their levels independently. One time I had it open and it did allow me to adjust the ""Vocal Mic"" level but not the ""Instrument"" level -- and I have no idea what I'd done differently that time. But I had both mikes plugged in and it didn't let me adjust their levels independently.

I've also found that it works differently with different recording software. I can record audio from all sources just fine in Garage Band and iMovie (I'm on a Mac). But for some reason whenever I try to use this to record audio in Premiere Pro I just get interference patterns that sound awful. I've used several different input sources for recording audio tracks in Premiere Pro in the past and never had a problem -- I understand how to set the audio hardware input and outputs properly -- but in spite of several tries I haven't been able to get this device to work with Premiere Pro. For me, that's almost a deal breaker, since that's really the program I use the most, and almost only ever record audio as a voiceover track to video I've edited in Premiere Pro.

I haven't tried it with any other recording software than Pre Pro, iMovie and GarageBand, so maybe it works just fine for most applications, but I find it to not be as intuitive or easy to use as the product description suggests. That disappoints me, since I've always been quite happy with Creative's products in the past -- including other products in the ""Sound Blaster"" line such as the fantastic Sound Blaster Roar speaker. Oh well. Others seem to be having better luck with it.

This is a good way to input and record a speaker, an instrument, and another",1

1085,"Took a chance on these, and they are marginal at best. There is no way the clamping mech will hold the sliding poles tight, even with the clamp tightened until it bottoms out. This isn't a problem with the upper section with the pin in place, but the lower section clamp will slide based on how what type of floor your are setting on and how heavy the speaker is. Having said that, for the few times a year these will be used, for the price, they are ok.",1
1086,"I thought I'd write a review for this because the price-point will certainly make it attractive to young players without a lot of money to spend who might look at this as a good way to get into looping. It's also marketed that way as a ""looper for guitarists,"" but honestly, I think every looper pedal on the market is ""for guitarists."" This one's inexpensive because they left off some very (IMO) indispensable knobs, buttons and displays--but it's only $50 less than one with all the bells and whistles.

This is a good pedal, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's never used a looper before. All of the things eliminated from this pedal for the sake of ""simplicity"" are actually pretty useful--buttons for storing, editing and deleting loops, knobs for navigating through your loops and the different operations, settings that allow you to change the tempo of a loop, a built-in drum track, and an LED screen to make it easier to find them and know when you're saving something rather than deleting it.

In addition to this Ditto, I also have a Digitech Jamman Solo JMSXT and a Jamman Stereo JMS2, and they truly are intuitive and easily my most used pedals. I use my looper to build songs--and it's fantastic for that. If I'm playing and come across a nice chord progression, I just tap the pedal and record it, and I've never used anything in my 30 years of playing guitar that's better for practicing lead riffs than a good looper.  So, if you're a young guy without much money to spend, I'd recommend you save up $50 and pick up the Digitech JMSXT Jamman Solo.

However, if you've used loopers, and you're looking for something to use on the fly in a live setting to just layer stuff, the Ditto will work for that (except for the fact that it doesn't use a battery--you have to use a wallwart). Like everything TC Electronics makes, it's a good quality pedal in an ironclad box.

So that's to say, I don't have any digs against the Ditto. I just want to make sure you know what you're not getting for that $50 extra bucks.",1

1098,"I wanted a small device that I can bring with me with me when I'm away from home, and on vacation, etc., so I can play my electric guitar without having to drag an amp around. I just want to be able to put my guitar, a few picks, a cord, headphones and a device like this into my case and be ready to play when I'm not home. So I picked up this device (in this model, above, and also in the Metal model, and Lead model) and another device to test them all. I would keep the ""winner"" and ship back the rest. Here are the results of my tests on the devices:

I picked up this little Vox Amplug (in the three units described above) and I also picked up a used Korg Toneworks Pandora PX4 at an auction site for $60 and figured I'd keep whichever one was the best. NO comparison. The Vox Amplug units went right back to Amazon immediately (I knew within 2 minutes). Don't get me wrong, the Vox Amplug units will give you a semi-decent tone to play to, but the Amplug devices are VERY limited in what you can do with it and there really is NOT a range of tones to work with, just either one tone with the gain on, or one tone with the gain turned way down, and a negligible difference in the middle ground (that is, in the gain settings between 1 and 10). All three of the Vox Amplug models (Metal, Lead, regular Guitar) have essentially the same general tone, and the tone itself is nothing to go crazy over....the ""Lead"" model has delay, but the delay itself is essentially a joke...you cannot adjust the delay level at all, and is a very thin delay, barely there and barely noticeable! You can turn down the gain (to its lowest level) on the units and get a semi-decent cleaner tone, but nothing to go crazy over. The amplug feels sort of flimsy in its overall make too, kind-of lightweight with thin plastic. Very delicate. Going from the Vox Amplug to the Korg PX4 is like going from a barebones early model Hyundai Elantra to a plush, cushy Cadillac; yes, the Elantra will get the job done, and get you from point A to point B, so to speak, but it's just NOT that exciting. I'm having a field day with the PX4 and my headphones though---and with the PX4 unit that I reviewed you can customize your tones and make tons of different great combos using different amps, cabs, reverbs, mods, delays, effects, etc....plus the PX4 has built-in drum and bass loops of all different styles to play to...plus you can record your own loop, and then jam over that, too....and also run an external device into it (cd or mp3 player)...the PX4 is an amazing little device, the Vox Amplug is definitely not....

So the Vox Amplug units are ""okay"" but it was a no-brainer for me to return them and I can't say enough good things about the device I'm using instead, the Korg PX4 (you can get a PX5 on this site too, or pick up a used PX4 or a similar device with WAY more features than the Vox Amplug). With the Vox Amplug, you'll have fully explored all of its capabilities and features in about 1-2 minutes. With the PX4, you will exploring it (in an enjoyable way) for hours and enjoying its vast amount of great features---the PX4 is really exciting to use and the amplug is NOT.

It was a slam-dunk decision to get rid of the Vox Amplug units and to use a WAY better device: Something to think about if you're considering the Vox Amplug.

And, in final summary of the Vox Amplug units:

PROS:
**Convenient, plugs right in and simple to use

CONS:
**Very limited in its capabalities---you'll have fully explored its capabilities in less than 2 minutes
**No delay, reverb, or other fun effects (Vox Amplug ""Lead"" unit has delay, but the delay is a joke--very lame)...No effects, esp. no decent delay or reverb is a major deal killer for me
**Thin, flimsy design; would probably snap into 5 pieces if you accidentally dropped it from only 5 inches off of the ground
**Small, hard to read writing on the units (for volume, gain, etc.)
**Not that fun or exciting to use
**The unit sounds completely thin and flat without even a hit of reverb or decent delay---- Boo !
**I plugged an mp3 player into the Vox unit, and overall it just seemed to sound like garbage, even after making my best attempt to balance volumes, etc...

Thanks, hope this is somewhat helpful....",1
1099,"I used this on a 5string bass. I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.

Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).

To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.

It does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers.",1
1100,"This is the only type of this product that I've tried so I have nothing to compare it to, but the slots are too shallow to hold a .053"" wound string.  I'll try filing it a little deeper to see if it solves the problem.  As stated above it overhangs the existing nut, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.  Since I'm a leftie (handed) I needed this product rather than the Grover type nut raiser.  And it works for that, other than the slot problem.  No more fret clicking with my heavy hands.",1

1102,"I bought this bow to use for silent evening practices.  I wanted a new cheap bow to leave it without rosin.  This bow definitely fits that description.  The hairs were not set well.  When it arrived, there were a few broken hairs and the rest were very loose.  I tightened it and took the broken hairs out.  When it is tightened enough to keep the hairs straight (and not falling out), there is considerable space between the wood and the hair.  More hairs have broken, or become unplucked, since then.  I have not broken any bow hairs before getting this bow.  I'm not banging the bow against anything, so I'm wondering why the hairs would keep breaking.  For my silent practices, this bow does seem to be adequate.  The bow feels light, the wood on it reminds me of the wood on a #2 pencil.  Cheap, but not too awkwardly unbalanced.  The description says the hairs are real horse hair, but I'm not convinced that is true.  They feel more plastic or nylon like, with the consistently of the stringy part of corn on the cobb husks.

This bow is serving its purpose for now, but I am glad to have additional bows to use when I'm less concerned about the noise.  I'm not sure how long this bow will last...  When it does fall apart, I probably won't bother fixing it.  I also probably wouldn't buy this one again.",1

I've modified a couple of my guitars with beefier parts and more contact for better resonance, stronger fundamentals, clarity, etc (High mass brass trem block, full contact - steel - saddles, super vee trem, etc) I use these strings with those guitars.

If you've done the mods that I have then the clarity these strings produce might be too much, the unwound third string will sound planky and brash, especially as it ages and with these strings my guitars have more resonance than I want, resonance and clarity is difficult to dial out with controls.  I've lowered my pickups and adjusted the poles so that helped out quite a bit.  Regardless, these strings produce more output, provide a more crisp edge, the fundamental of every note is stronger and the harmonics ring out in spades, all things that I like.  What I DON'T like about these strings is that if I break one string I have to replace the whole set because they don't sell singles and regular, single string, replacements have about 25% less volume, less resonance and less output.  Even though I rarely break strings it has happened enough times that I'm re-thinking the value these provide... the output on regular strings is significantly lower to the point that replacing a string can have a NOTICEABLE effect on my sound at crucial moments and that's one more variable I don't want to have to deal with in those moments.",1

- Not expensive compared to other cases I've seen (bought mine here for $36.99)
- Extremely light-weight
- Should protect against wind/rain.
- The customer service (my return transaction) from J&R Music and Computer World went pretty smoothly.

Cons:
- Misleading representation of product (i.e., it may NOT fit your keyboard because it is so tightly designed)
- It does not seem to protect against impact/drops.

Overall, I wish I didn't have to buy the bigger version of this for my keyboard, but at least I have what I need now.  This is definitely an improvement from carrying my keyboard fully exposed.

1130,"This Fender strap is decent enough, and does a good job of getting the vintage look across, but the finishing work on it leaves a bit to be desired. The leather feels very cheap, and I can see the top layer peeling off in due time. Also, the bottom felt pad looks like someone dropped it on a dirty floor and stepped on it a few times for good measure, before sewing it onto the main strap. At this point, I'm not sure if I want to embarrass my '60s Telecaster Classic by saddling up this strap to it...",1
1131,not the best for bass will look further,1
1132,"Tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just OK to me.  It does need a hot signal going in to sound good, so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups.  The distortion is fuzzy, but not fuzz, almost like a fuzzy static.  The EQ switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so I always have the tone in the circuit. I used it with a vintage Vibrolux Reverb. This is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal.  I am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me.  It is made well. For the money I am not mad I tried it.",1
1133,"Traveler guitars are the worlds shortest full scale guitars, a pretty neat trick by itself. They accomplish this by anchoring the strings at the end of the headstock, ala Steinberg,  wrapping them around plastic pulleys at the other end, and then tying them to tuners buried in the middle of the body. Its a clever trick, but one not without disadvantages. Stringing a Traveler is a slow, difficult, process. If youve ever restrung a Rickenbacker 12 string, well, this is worse. You not only have tuners buried deep in the body, strings must be carefully routed over both pulleys and bridge, and these are on opposite sides of the guitar. I think the next set of strings I put on mine will be Elixers, so I can put off the next restringing for very long time.

Playability is surprisingly good. I don't bother with the bent wire body extension, preferring.to just hang it from a strap. Neck geometry isn't great, but its not bad. The fingerboard had a fairly flat radius, likea flattop steel string guitar. Tone is good, too. The skinny humbuking pickup delivers plenty of highs, but its not thin as youd expect from the position near the bridge. It has a good, full, sound. Theres no volumeor tone knobs. Theyve been left off in the cause of compactness.

So why only three stars? In part, because its a guitar with very limited application, and in part because I think theres a lot they could improve. Their tuner and stringing system has been around since 1992 and in that time they haven't addressed any of its problems, like the loose pulleys with gaps that add to the stringing difficulties, and the inaccessibility of the tuners. How about putting a square head on the keys so you could use a drum key to reach in, or tightenng up the sloppy fit of the pulleys? Or using slotted tuners, a la Fender? There are scores of such possible improvement.

If you absolutely need a full scale electric guitar that fits in a carryon suitcase, Traveler is your only choice. But if you just want a compact guitar for travel, keep looking.",1
1134,"I had a 2011 model of this guitar and loved it, especially after I swapped the brass saddles for Graph-Tecs and had it set up properly by ""GC"". It was fairly light, and I loved, loved the skinny, fast playing neck on that one. It was of much better quality than ANY of the more expensive Fender MIMexico Telecasters I have ever had the misfortune to pick up (there are a few series/models/runs that are nicer in the MexiTeles, but most I see around are clunky, thick-necked affairs with pitting in the metal, especially in the knobs/switch plate. My Chinese Squier was a dream and made me play guitar more often, I just couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, I lost my job at the time and to cover an electric bill sold the guitar back to GC at a significant loss (I don't ever recommend doing this, I just didn't have time to wait around for a good price), even with the saddle upgrades. Anyway, this holiday season I found myself in the position to purchase a new one and (again buying a guitar sight unseen on the internet is risky, all of them vary from rig to rig even in the same model) and this time received a 2014 model but this isn't nearly the same guitar. It's a few pounds heavier, and the woodgrain isn't nearly as nice-looking, but my biggest complaint is the neck. It's not anything like the thinner, fast playing neck on my 2011' model was. This feels (and looks) thicker, like the MIM models I've played, and I'm just hoping the company I bought this one from (MF, they had a better coupon at the time and I got the guitar for under $300) has a decent return policy, I don't mind spending a little to see a few more, but this one is definitely going back. I might even try to find an earlier model because I think they were trying harder when these first came out. Unfortunately, on eBay, even the used ones sell for full price, but I can't afford another $4-500 to get an entry level American model, and even then I'd probably have to try more than one to find what I'm looking for. I'm upset, of course, but some of these Classic Vibe series Teles REALLY ARE very nice.",1

1139,"Losing sticks has long been a curse to drummers.

Your hands get sweaty, and sticks go flying.

You can combat the problem with playing gloves or stick wrap, the latter of which I use -- Promark, in fact.

So I was interested to try these Promark sticks with ""Activegrip technology,"" an ""ultra-thin, heat-activated coating"" that ""grips stronger the harder you play.""

The good news is -- the Activegrip coating seems to work.  I didn't lose the sticks when I was playing.

The bad news is -- I don't think I like these Promark sticks as well as the Vic Firth 5A's I usually use.

These sticks are about 1/4-inch longer than 5A's and seem to be about the same weight. The black Activegrip coating extends the length of the stick, up to the tip. I personally prefer nylon tips, which I think give a crisper, brighter sound on cymbals, but if you prefer wood tips, these are for you.

Rolling these sticks along a counter to check for warping, one rolled smoothly, and the other wobbled a little. The Vic Firth 5A's I normally use have always passed this test with no wobbling.

Otherwise I don't know what to make of the black rubber bands encircling these sticks when I pulled them out of their cardboard sleeve. One stick had one band, the other had two. Perhaps these bands were included to prevent the sticks from falling out of the sleeve in transit? I really don't understand their purpose.

After a few hours of playing, at least one small chunk of the black coating had chipped off, and indeed, the guy at the rehearsal studio said that's a common failing with coated sticks.  I know that after using the Promark stick wrap for sometime, that stuff starts shredding and shedding on the drumheads as well.

It also appears that these sticks are showing more nicks than the Vic Firths do after a comparable amount of playing -- and I'm not a heavy hitter!

These have inspired me to see if VF has a comparable coated anti-slip stick, and they do -- 5A's with nylon tips.  Just what I like!

So I give these Promarks an okay rating, but I think Firths are more durable and have fewer problems with warping.  I think I'll try the VF 5A's with anti-slip coating and nylon tips...",1
1140,"I recently purchased another 9V mini amp: the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danelectro-N10B-Honey-Tone-Mini-Amp-in-Burgundy/dp/B000B6DHB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danelectro N10B Honey Tone Mini Amp in Burgundy</a>&nbsp;for less than $20.

When I tried the HoneyTone, my reaction was ""meh.""  It works OK, but the tone is pretty thin.  Basically what I'd expect from a 9V amp with small speaker.

The JA-01 is a bit smaller.  It has an internal 2"" speaker compared to the HoneyTone's 3"" speaker.  But the JA-01 sounds MUCH worse than the HoneyTone.  I've grown to respect that little HoneyTone.

Basically, the JA-01 sounds like a cheap portable AM radio.  It starts hissing as soon as you turn it on.  It has two settings: ""clean"" and ""distortion,"" but they should really be labeled ""distortion"" and ""more distortion.""  The only way to get anything resembling a ""clean"" sound is to turn the volume down (on your guitar, since there's no volume control on the JA-01).

The 1/4"" jack on the JA-01 is also a bit flaky.  But it works.  Most of the time.

Depending on your guitar, it'll either stick out like a sore thumb from the top, or it'll be in the way of your leg if the jack is on the side.

It's better than trying to use something like a portable iPod amp for your guitar, but not by much.",1
1141,"These are the best deal for drumsticks but there's one problem - LET US CHOSE THE SIZE!

1142,"I bought this stand used for $20, and for that price I'm satisfied with it. My complaints:

- The center tube has a tendency to slip unless cranked down very tightly.
- The spring isn't adjustable. My '70s New Beats are a little too heavy and cause the pedal response to be a bit sluggish. I've also used this stand with a pair of 12"" hats, and had the opposite problem: it was hard to produce subtle differences in pedal pressure, as the spring overpowered the light top cymbal.

They are solid... and chrome is very pretty... YET, feel solid...  JUST A TAD on the loosey-bouncey suspended tom feeling, on anything bigger than a 12"" x 8"".

NO MEMORY LOCK on the L ROD... important to know... I got an extra set of GibraltarL rod memory locks, worked perfectly... but had to shell an extra 10 bucks for that.

1145,"I have exclusively played Suzuki's since I was about 13. My first harp was the Promaster & I loved the weight & the sound.
Just last year I discovered the Valved Promaster which seems to project better sound giving you more room to bend the notes. One problem with valved Promasters is they all seemed to need to be broken in before you could get the full sound out of the harps.
The SUZUKI MANJI is the best ""play right out of the box harp"". You get the great sound & ability to bend notes like the valved promaster without the dead notes or having to break it in much. It does have one ""dead note"" Since I got it the 3 hole is a little tough to blow through.

Bottom line is I really like this harp but it's not perfect. I want to keep experimenting & maybe try some HOHNER/Lee Oscars...
If your looking for professional sound this is a great harp. If your not used to nice harmonicas you will be blown away & amazed at how good you can sound playing a nice one compared to a lower grade or toy-store harp.
Keep honkin'!",1
1146,"I only received the guitar a week ago and didn't have a chance to spend some substantial time with it yet.
Out of the box it was out of tune. Not that I expected to find it in tune but I read several other reviews for this and other guitars, here and elsewhere how the guitar just received was in tune, ready to play.
The neck relief and 12th fret action seem to be OK. So seems to be the action at the nut.
I did a quick tune up and played it shortly. The unplugged sound is pretty good. Plugged in, it sounds good but nothing out of the ordinary.
There is a little buzzing but I think that comes from the bridge, from the infamous ABR-1 retainer spring wire. I'll need to investigate that more.
The neck feels very good. It is wider than on 6 string guitars but that's a positive, at least for me and my fat fingers. I do have to get used to it though. But in the end I prefer this width for a 12 string.
The Grover tuners feel good and operate smoothly.
The fretboard is much darker than what is shown in the pictures. That's another good thing as I will not have to ebonize it now.
The frets could have been better polished. They look polished but feel a little rough when bending. I will address this when I go thru the full setup.
Now for the ""not so good"" part. The neckplate has a smudge that I tried to clean up and I can't. It is probably some dried up glue of polyurethane that was used for the finish. I tried scraping it with my fingernail and it looks like very little came off. I don't want to use anything harder to scrape so I do not damage the chrome plating. I contacted Dean. Maybe they can suggest something to help remove this smudge or maybe they'll send a replacement neckplate. Interestingly, a couple of the tuner buttons seems to have the same kind of smudge but much smaller.
While the black finish on the back and sides appears good, on the front there are some fine abrasion marks between the bridge and the upper F-hole. They are barely visible when looking at the guitar from a certain angle.

I have met very few people who sound ""Amazing"" on these microphones when compared to other models that suit their voice well.

A Major con for this microphone is that for low ranged vocalist they are going to be very unclear due to the lack of sensitivity in the Mid-High and High ranges. The tone on these microphones is also only decent on a good day.

1160,"----------Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic:
-(***__) Overall: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still a fantastic wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, though often custom versions (which any of us can easily buy, at a cost). The Marine Band has an amazing sound, but the reason I did not rate it higher is there are other harmonicas I prefer in terms of comfort and playability (full comparison and ranking below). My favorite wood-comb harmonica is the Marine Band Crossover, which is simply an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 classic. If you are a beginner I strongly recommend the Hohner Special 20 (plastic comb) for its ease of play. If you are willing to spend more I recommend the Suzuki Promaster (metal comb), which is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica.
-(*****) Sound: Excellent. This harmonica feels warm and deep. It is as good as my favorite: the Marine Band Crossover. However variations in sound quality between harmonicas are slight and likely to be lost on an audience. I'd much rather focus on getting a comfortable harmonica.
-(**___) Comfort: Wood-comb harmonicas just never seem to be as comfortable as plastic-comb ones. The Marine Band is not the worst I have experienced, but the coverplates do stick out over the wood comb slightly. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, which is uncomfortable. The Special 20 (plastic comb) and Suzuki Promaster (metal comb) are significantly more comfortable.
-(***__) Playability: The protruding coverplates make it harder to get a tight seal and are an issue. I didn't have excessive gapping issues with any individual reeds or any being excessively out of tune. I didn't have issues with reeds getting ""stuck"", which is unusual at this price range.
-(**___) Durability: Durability is the weakness of Hohner overall. With wood-combs you add the additional issue that the comb can/will warp over time.
-(**___ Aesthetics): Very standard classic look, but the yellow coating on the wood is unattractive. I give it two stars instead of three because I much prefer the natural look of the Marine Band Crossover's wood comb. The carrying case is hard plastic and will break eventually, not as nice as the crossover's zippable pouch.

-----------Qualitative Comparison with other mid-price Harmonicas (lowest to highest score)
---(**___) Hohner Blues Harp: This is the harmonica I own that I don't enjoy playing. The redeeming quality is the Blues Harp sounds very good, enough to compete with any harmonica in its price range. However the metal covers protrude and are sharp on the lips, making it simply too uncomfortable to be any good. The Marine Band is more comfortable (covers protrude less).
---(**___) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20(the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band.
---(***__) Seydel 1847 Silver (plastic comb) and Noble (metal comb): Seydel 1847 and its distinctive steel reeds is the company's flagship and a harmonica I find very polarizing. positive is that the coverplates form an uniquely thin opening for the mouth which makes it extremely easy to play. The downside is my Seydel 1847's are my only harmonicas that sound undeniably unpleasant. Both harmonicas have a distinctly metallic tinny sound, which is probably due to the steel reeds, and explains why steel is not a common choice for reed material. Comfortable harmonica with tinny sound; overall not recommended.
---(****_) Suzuki Pureharp: Having both coverplates and the comb made out of rosewood makes the Pureharp perhaps the most attractive harmonica available and theone with the warmest and most enjoyable sound. It is surprisingly easy to play, though the wood coverplates slide less smoothly and require more saliva. Not recommended for a fast song. Too unique to be a first harmonica, it is great for a player looking to expand their collection with a harmonica that has a great warm tone.
---(****_) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. It is extremely similar to the Special 20. It has a good reputation for durability, and my experience is that it outlasts the Special 20. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing. Ultimately I prefer the Special 20: The Lee Oskar feels slightly thicker on the lips because of the way the coverplates are rounded, which I don't like
---(****_) Suzuki Firebreath: Excellent harmonica but poor value for the high price tag. In true Suzuki style, this black beauty and its rosewood comb look stunning. The sound is awesome and distinct: it is very soothing and my absolute favorite for slower melodies. The Firebreath is comfortable for a wood-comb harmonica; no sharp angles. The drawback is I find it difficult to get a tight seal on this harmonica and therefore can't comfortably play blues or other fast music. This is my favorite high-quality harmonica for slow songs, but I do not find it versatile and would not recommend it as a first/main harmonica or as a blues harmonica.
---(*****) Hohner Marine Band Crossover: My favorite wood-comb harmonica. This is an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 Classic. The nails that hold shut the 1896 have been replaced with screws that permit cleaning and replacing the reeds, the comb's yellow finish has been replaced with a smooth clear finish which keeps the natural color of the wood and looks much better. It comes with a great zippable case, which is the best of any harmonica. The Crossover maintains the great tone of a Marine Band, producing a great wood comb harmonica.
--(*****) Hohner Special 20: My favorite Plastic Comb Harmonica, and outstanding in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one but not as nice as the (excellent) pouch that comes with the Marine Band Crossover.
---(*****) Suzuki Promaster Valved: This metal-comb harmonica is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica. It hits all the marks with a great sound and a particularly outstanding playability. The surface is smooth and comfortable on the lips and allows for a tight seal and easy playability. The harmonica is shiny and sleek looking, and comes with a good quality plastic case with rounded corners that make it comfortable in the pockets. If I could only own one off-the-shelf harmonica I would own this one.

---------- Custom Harmonica:
--(*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus: Simply the best harmonica I have played, but comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. This very heavy harmonica is objectively the easiest to play out of the many I own. I literally stopped to smile the first time I tried it. We can debate forever if it's actually worth the high price, maybe it isn't. What's certain is that a great harmonica is not enough to make you a great player but also that off-the-shelf quality can't compete with the Optimus.

----------Note on the 2-draw:
1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.

----------Note on which key to buy first:
--Start with a key of C.
This is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner.
--Then: A, D, G
A is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar.
--Then Bb, F, E,... here is gets more debatable

I'm using it along with a Joyo ""Gate of Kahn"" to tame the noise. My biggest beef with this pedal are the frequency sliders. Slide pots are supposed to have a linear taper to them. These sliders behave like Log taper pots at each end of their travel. In the middle section of their travel there is virtually no change being made to the sound. As you get to the slide's ends the amount of change in sound is HUGE so it takes a light touch to dial in the sound you want.

1174,"First things first - this is not my first recording interface box. I have used a Yamaha Audiogram 3 for the past 7-8 years and have really gotten used to and enjoyed it. Have used it mostly with GarageBand, but also with Cubase and some other software. The limitation of that box is that you can only record one track at a time (i.e. one input device). I was glad to see that the Presonus Audiobox allows multi-track (i.e. two) recording.

Set up was pretty easy - although instructions were extremely basic and left most up to me to figure out. And, while it is nice to be able to use your iPad to record with, you do need an external power source, so found I needed to be near a USB-connected laptop/desktop anyway. That makes for a lot of cords and devices in close proximity. I have a Shure condensor microphone that works well with this box, so tested that with an electric guitar plugged into line 2. Recording was easy, but there are definite limitations. Anything beyond just laying down tracks and a bit of cut and pasting will need to be done on your laptop or desktop once you transfer the file recorded onto your iPad. I will try this box with some other software programs and see if I like it better - it just seems to be a little limited, and it is probably the limitations of the software environment that are prejudicing me towards having a less than glowing evaluation of the box itself.",1

1178,The pickups are very low output but everything fits like a glove in this strat I was putting together.,1
1179,"First off, things I like about these stubby picks:
1.  Comfortable to hold and feels solid.  Has a beveled edge which makes it great for fast attack.
2.  Easier picking--clear and articulate tone on steel strings. Gives good attenuation in low end- very punchy.  Might be good on heavier strings or bass guitars.
3.  Reasonably priced

My criticisms:
1.  The hard plastic does not give at all.  Strumming seems to produce more of a ""picking"" sound rather than a smooth tone on steel strings.  If you normally hold your picks firm, you will need to lighten your grip some to get a smooth strum.
2.  I normally use nylon picks and I'm not sure if nylon is porous, but with the hard plastic on these stubbies, I could feel the oils from my fingers build up on the pick.  Not a big issue but something I've never noticed with regular nylon picks.
3.  Pinch harmonics require you to hold the pick closer to the tip and I found that this becomes a little more challenging with the stubby tips.

I purchased these to experiment on my tone.  My guitars either have 9s or 11s strings, and these felt good on the 11s.  Not so much on the lighter strings.  Bottom line, plectrums are a personal choice and after using these for several hours, I always found myself returning to my old picks.  I may give their nylon version a try.",1
1180,"This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is. I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price. I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future. It works fine, just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past.",1

1183,"Well i had some really unrealistic expectations for this pedal; especially after seeing all the demo's on youtube and what not. Not to say that this item was a complete bust; just know what to expect from a $50 Pitch Shifter. it aint no whammy pedal, but it does the diggidy.

  Can't play chords sometimes. u try to make a G or something with the harmonizer and it sounds like a flanger pedal is being molested with a cinder block. the drop tune isn't very effective if you are already dropped to a lower key. im tuned to drop-c, so whenever i drop-tune THAT; i get artifacts from the jurassic! One thing i am looking forward to is adding the expression pedal, the box DOES have some nice sweep to the trem bar effect; but only at a fixed speed that you have to dial in. i would simply prefer to control the sweep myself; so if nothing else the pedal does give you options...

  All in all it's an alright pedal for $50. But if you want a real clean sound platform to use effects from; get the whammy. Especially if you don't like taking stuff apart. otherwise save the extra $150 and get this pedal. When you do; buy a real cheap wah and look up how to convert it to expression. the results may SHOCK you!!!",1
1184,"I needed new strings for my cello. The strings that were on the cello were D'Addario Kaplan D and A strings, and D'Addario Helicore G and C strings. After consulting with my cello instructor, I decided to replace all strings with the Kaplan medium tension set. Now, I am quite capable of restringing a cello. And everything went perfectly...until the 'A' string. It absolutely would not stretch beyond G# no matter how much time I gave it to settle in a little at a time. Finally it snapped. I can only assume a defect in the string since the older A string (remember same brand) was fine. These strings are expensive. This should not happen when you take the price and supposed quality into account. Now I have to cancel at least one lesson and hope I can get a new A string quickly.

1188,"This mandolin is a beautiful instrument. It is soft, stirring, and easy to play. Even though the mandolin is a 100 star, I had to rate it a 3 because I would not reccomend buying it from amazon. My reasons:
1) It comes unassembled- and personally I don't want to pay someone to set it up after I've had to pay for the entire instrument
2) It is packaged in simply a box and a tiny thin wrapping of foam

Basically, my instrument arrived with the neck snapped, and the strings coiling off it. I had to send it back, and was very dissapointed to see the UPS had crushed the box (and even ripped a hole in it). While I do not at all blame amazon for my mandolin arriving destroyed, it was completely improper packaging for a 400$ instrument. I bought the same mandolin from the 'mandolin store' online, and it arrived in a free hardshell case.
Again, amazon is carrying a lovely instrument, however I do not reccomend buying it from this store.",1
1189,"I've seen the EBow around for years but only recently decided to take the plunge and get one.  Over the past several years I've been playing mostly acoustic guitar and other acoustic instruments, so I made a lot of inquiries as to whether this device would actually work with an acoustic instrument.  I was assured that it would.

And it does -- after a fashion.  I tried it with 6- and 12- string guitar, mandolin, bluegrass banjo, tres cubano, and mandotar (a 6-string mandolin tuned like an octave guitar).  I eventually got it to work on all of these instruments, though it worked a lot better on some than on others.  The mandolins were the worst; I could only consistenly activate the top two courses -- the wound strings, not at all.  12-string and tres worked after I found the right spot on the strings for most consistent activation.  The 6-string guitar worked moderately well, but the most consistent operation was obtained from the banjo.

Overall, though, I was disappointed.  Even on the banjo, it typically took anywhere from one to as much as five seconds before the string really began to sound, and playing a phrase on more than one string was impossible without significant gaps, while the new string built up momentum.  Probably this could be improved somewhat with practice, but the sluggish response makes me think that this device will be of only very limited use to me in certain very slow and deliberate styles of music.

Another thing I noticed was that the EBow tended to excite an upper partial -- usually the first overtone -- of the string, rather than the fundamental.  This happened regardless of whether the switch was set in ""normal"" or ""harmonic"" mode, although it did happen faster in ""harmonic"" mode.  Possibly this also could be improved with practice, but in three hours of working with the device I was still only averaging maybe one out of five times as far as getting any string to sound at pitch right off the bat.

The enclosed instructional material tells us that, on an electric guitar, there is a ""sweet spot"" over the pickup pole pieces, where the EBow will work both most quickly and with the most intensity.  Supposedly there is no ""sweet spot"" on acoustic instruments, but here I have to disagree.  On acoustics the EBow will definitely not work equally well anywhere on the string.  I found that certain harmonic nodes located between the bridge and the end of the fingerboard were most responsive and loudest; I couldn't get any of the instrument to sound with the EBow held near the bridge.

The enclosed instructional materials include a small CD with examples of the many amazing things the EBow can do -- on electric guitar.  Unfortunately, I can't see most of these happening -- rapid arpeggios, spicatto, ""flute"" sounds, etc. -- on an acoustical instrument.  I don't want to take too much away from this device; no doubt it really can do all the various things demonstrated on the CD, provided they're done on -electric- guitar. Although it does techincally ""work"" with acoustic instruments, it doesn't work well enough with them for this to be an advertising point for the EBow.

And one last caveat:  for a $100 accessory, the EBow isn't really built that well.  The plastic construction was expected, although something heavier-duty -- like ABS -- would have been better, and the battery compartment cover stays in place with a single plastic tab, that I can see breaking after the second or third battery change.  I get the distinct impression that if one dropped this device while on stage, one had better have a backup, because I doubt it would survive even a fall from waist height, intact.

Bottom line: If this had cost maybe $20-$30, or if I had intended to use it primarily on electric guitar, I would have given it a better review.  But at $100 its usefulness on acoustic instruments is too limited to justify the cost.",1

1196,"Kyser is one of the largest capo brands on the market, and quite possibly the most popular quick-release spring loaded capo. Professionals and novices use them alike because of their reported easiness and functionality. Because of their reputation, I picked up one a couple years ago to use as an alternative to a micrometer capo. Today, I just about never use the Kyser. Here's why:

From day one, the Kyser was always extremely stiff. While it's no secret that the springs on these need a certain amount of use to break in, the spring today is still not much better. When placed correctly, the capo generally keeps good intonation. However, I've found that it often takes several re-positions to get the right sound. The capo works good at capo 1&2, but will almost guaranteed pull the strings out of tune at capo 3 onwards. If the capo is pulling the strings so much as to majorly de-tune them (more than a half-step over time) imagine what it is doing to the frets for wear? The Kyser may be the quickest and easiest capo to change, but the bottom line is that it's tension is alarmingly tight and has the potential to damage the neck over time. If you're working off a cheaper guitar that you don't care too much about, the Kyser is no doubt the easiest and most convenient capo choice. I would by no means recommend this capo if you are using an expensive guitar due to it's tendency to over-exert pressure. Capos like the Shubb or G7th offer you the ability to adjust tension while still retaining much functionality ease. For expensive guitars, I'd spend a couple extra bucks and check out one of those. Happy playing!",1

1215,cheap pot metal screws....Fender junk,1
1216,"I have to disclose that I'm a bit of a Joyo rube, as evidenced by the nearly dozen or so of them I now own.  So given that I bought the pedal, and am generally very happy with it, it pains me to give anything other than a 5-star review.  Still, they can't all be 5* pedals, so I think a 4* rating is more appropriate for this pedal that does one specific thing pretty well, but nothing else.

My biggest gripe with the Plexi Drive isn't with how it sounds, but more with the fact that it's a sound that's readily available on dozens of other pedals, even those under $100.  In terms of gain structure, it reminds me a little of the MXR '78 Badass Distortion, except that it isn't as hot/bright, and it offers a little more gain.  Users of this pedal will find that it depends heavily on the quality of your amp's clean tone, which becomes increasingly true as you use dirtboxes with less gain/saturation (which tends to smother or ""hide"" the underlying tone).  For this reason, subjective opinions on how it sounds may vary from rig-to-rig.

But all that being said, the pedal does rock.  Turn it on over as clean a tone as possible, and you can hit crunchy power chords with good mid-range punch and clarity.  It also has a nice low-end presence that some other distortion pedals lack.  The tone doesn't behave differently by changing the amount of gain, however.  You get that vintage Marshall crunch with low gain settings, and then the same tone with more saturation as you turn it up.  It does pair well with a good overdrive, such as the excellent Joyo Sweet Baby OD.  Not necessarily good or bad, it just ""is"".

The build quality is good enough for most people, but certainly not to the level of a BOSS, MXR, or even some Biyang and older Joyo pedals.  Everything works great now, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of these Joyo switches fail in 5-10 years.  At this price point, though, that's not an unreasonable risk to take.

It was easier to purchase the Plexi with the prices falling to the $35 to $45 (U.S.) range, as opposed to nearly $60.  But unlike the other Joyo products, which offer boutique-caliber clones, the Hot Plexi didn't ""blow me away"" as a unique value.  But it sounds great, dials in simply and reliably, and is cheap, all of which make a great option for budget players or dirtpedal-obsessed hobbyists (raising hand).

UPDATE (09/21/2013) - Re-visited my review; going to revise it to 3 stars, as much as that pains me.  Perhaps I'm being too hard on this pedal but for me, the number one rule for any distortion box (and especially on specifically dedicated to hard rock, aggressive, distorted Marshall tones) is this: It can't get QUIETER when you step on the pedal.  The whole point of distortion pedals is that you need it to be on unity gain or INCREASE your volume easily.  I have this turned all the way up, and it's barely at unity gain on any setting.  That's unacceptable.  Did the side-by-size with the MXR '78 Badass again, and while the Hot Plexi has a great sound (arguably) even better, it's not useful to me once you perceive it to be ""weak"".

This is not true example of the Joyo lineup, many of which are great products and have TONS of power on tap.  The Crunch Distortion and Ultimate Drive have absurd amounts of output.  This Hot Plexi is simply a near miss, and a slight disappointment.",1

1222,"I recently purchased this kit thinking that it would be a handy thing to have. As it turned out, it was more of a nuisance than a convenience. Here is a break down of the pros and cons.
PROS:
  ~It is has a range of products.
  ~It comes with cleaning cloths.
  ~The fret board cleaner and ""deep conditioner"" seemed to work OK.
  ~The fret board does look better after applying the deep conditioner.
  ~The only thing worth keeping is the guitar cleaner. It does a decent job of doing what is says it will do.
CONS:
  ~As I had read in another review, the cloths do ball up when buffing the wax.
  ~Not sure why, but the wax was rather strange. It did not buff out like other waxes that I have applied to the finish. Another thing about the wax: it
  seemed to me that there were more scratches in the guitar's finish AFTER applying and buffing the wax than before.
  ~The micro cloth for cleaning the frets did work, to an extent. But not as well as lightly brushing them with some mild steel wool. It was also
  use with out hitting the fret board.
  ~Listen to the other reviews. The ""fret board cleaner"" did seem like a mild acetone or other similar cleaning product. It dried out the fret board
  horribly. It did clean it, however (or so it seemed; it might have just been removing the stain on the fret board. I'm not really sure).
  ~The bottle with the fret board oil was a pain in the rear. It has a pressure activated nozzle capped with an applicator sponge. It did not work at
  for application the fret board. I ended up pulling the sponge applicator off so I could daub the oil onto a paper towel and spread as I pleased.
  ~The cleaning cloths that come with the kit are of poor quality. They are obviously of a cheap material and of poor cut.
  ~I tried the string cleaner, but quickly ditched the idea. After it dried, it became sticky. Not the best thing in the world.

Overall, I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it to a friend. I was rather disappointed with the quality of the products. But, you do get what you pay for. Thankfully, I will be able to return to my normal guitar maintenance products this month.",1

Well, the longer lasting strings are due to a clear coating they spray onto the strings.

1230,"I would say that this box is fine for light-duty applications.  If you plan on mounting heavy gear in it, look elsewhere.  Note that I am a guitarist/keyboardist and not a DJ, so my needs may be different than DJs in terms of the gear used on a gig.  I need to haul a mixer, power amp, Eleven Rack, power conditioner, and effects units.

My primary objection is that there are no ""real"" rack rails (i.e. metal rack rails).  The rails in this box are made of heavy plastic and are molded into the construction.  Screws are provided, but they aren't standard rack screws.  They are more like wood screws so that they can dig into the plastic holes in the ""rails"".

My unit wasn't wide enough at the top and bottom to provide a proper fit to my gear.  In the middle, the ""rails"" tend to bulge inward.  I got my gear in, but it was a bit of a chore.  I had planned to mount my Mackie 1202-VLZ3 on top and everything else on the bottom.  Given the poor quality ""rails"", I did not think that my heavy RAMSA power amp would work well in the upper portion of the lower rack.  I could not fit it into the very bottom rack space because of the inconsistent construction of this unit.  My recommendation is to place all of your gear before screwing it all in to allow for the flexing of the ""rails"".

In the end, I mounted the mixer up top and the power amp behind it.  This did not leave room to attach standard 1/4"" plugs into the back of the mixer, so I will have to buy some right-angle patch cables to make everything fit.  The lower rack holds a Sonic Maximizer, power conditioner, and an Eleven Rack with room to spare.

There are some things that I like about this box.  For one, it's not that heavy and it's quite durable.  With my gear in it, it is  quite a load and the handles work well for two people to carry the box.  The cover is light and will only protect against dust and light hits, but it works well for what it is.  If you need a hard cover, move up into something else.  For the low price, this works fairly well as a light-duty unit.  If you are playing out a lot, invest in a better box.  I plan to move into something else and keep this in my studio to sit on top of another rack unit.  It will work very well in that application and the  light cover is perfect for keeping dust out of pots and faders.",1

The neck measured in at about 7.43k, and the bridge at about 14.3k. Ceramic magnet driven. They are a little on the light side as far as weight, so not sure what gauge the coil wire is. They are wired with single conductor wire...if you want to coil tap, you will have to operate. No excess wax. The pickup rings did not line up with stock Epiphone rings(Epiphone slightly longer by about 1mm). The pickup rings are flat..not curved. These are installed in a poplar bodied Ibanez Jem copy, three way switch, 1meg pot..no tone control). The neck sounds surprisingly good! The bridge is pretty good too, but slightly muddy. (Thinking of popping a ceramic 8 magnet to bump the highs up). I predict that these would be dark sounding in a mahogany body and or with a 500k pot. Overall, I am thoroughly shocked that these pickups sound as good as they do. They are one-dimensional, but get the job done just fine. Mine were built just fine, but at this price point I would be concerned about the consistency of future sets. As far as build quality, I would directly compare these to stock Epiphone humbuckers...without the amount of wax that Epiphone uses. Tone seems a little more clear and bright than Epiphone, as well. I would buy them again for a cheap fun build...or at least until you find out what ""flavor"" pickup a guitar wants. Shoot, get these, a spool of pickup wire and build yourself a set of hand-guided scatterwounds for cheap!",1
1259,"Mine sounded muddy and I had to return it.  Also, its a single tone MIDI converter, which means it will only play sound for 1 note on 1 string at a time.  Not very useful...",1

Would i buy it again, if on a budget and really needed a 'verb...yes.  but for $120 you can get a TC Electronics HOF....aluminum chassis, programmable....very high quality programs to start with....last for years.

would i recommend for a beginner....sure.  $50 is a lot to spend on this stuff for some people.",1

I read many of the reviews on the Grover 102C Rotomatic tuners and most of the comments were favorable. I had to give only three stars because they did not fit my guitar! Since the head of the guitar could have caused more serious damage and weakened the head not allowing proper tuning of the guitar! For the right fit they probably would have been an easy 5 star, as they seemed to be well made!",1

1277,"I really like this guitar stand, it held 9 guitars actually (although I wouldn't personally risk it). I am currently using it for 7 bass guitars and they all fit without smacking into each other, still be careful. The build quality is the only reason I did not rate this 5 stars. It's for the most part stable & would really take a good smacking to knock it down. However I feel the weight of the actual guitars are what help keep this in place. Personally I would never gig with this stand. After inspecting the metal hinges they are definitely not put together well enough for the extensive amount of abuse it would take while gigging. However, at home and left in place, this is a perfectly functional guitar/bass stand. The padding is very thick and so far has not left any marks on my guitars (although I haven't had them on their for a long time.",1
1278,Ok,1
1279,"This was purchased for my home brew Les Paul build. Gibson does not make white plastics so I went aftermarket with this pickup selector cap. I bought the entire switch because it was cheaper than the cap alone by nearly five dollars. The cap is perfect in size and color. If you were purchasing for the switch itself however, I would advise against this Chinese made switch. It is obviously low quality in construction, and the switching mechanism is exposed, not enclosed like most standard pickup selector switches. I should note also the cap is threaded metric not standard for those purchasing for the cap as I did.",1
1280,"For the price this is an excellent guitar strap like the others have said.  It has a nice lock strap that will be easy to get on and off.  Very good quality for the price, Planet Waves makes great guitar stuff for cheap.

I am returning this strap.  It was nice quality for the price, but I found a better one for double the price that has it's own locking ends on it built in.  I didn't know how to use this locking strap.",1
1281,"Unfortunately, after having this professionally installed, I can't get past two things: 1) the amount of travel (about 3/32"") for the switch to engage is just too much to be musical and to follow the tempo (it is somewhat slow in bouncing back as well), and 2) unless the switch seats perfectly when pushed down, there is static and not a clear break in the signal.",1
1282,look pretty good but will need to install,1
1283,"Update Feb. 2017: Had to bring this mixer to a repair shop because the headphones output cuts out intermittently. I tried different headphones and adapters and the problem still persisted. Waiting for the repair tech to find a solution.

Old review: I really like this mixer. Great clean sound for live use. The knobs have a good solid feel to them, except for the channel volume faders and Main stereo and Main FX return fader, they are just ok. The chassis feels well built. I was lucky enough to compare the preamps and the effects to a Behringer QX mixer, and the Yamaha was better to my ears. The effects, especially the reverb, sounds way more musical than the Behringer. The single-knob compressors on the Yamaha were also better sounding than the Behringer, which add  a bit of hiss when I turned the compressor pass 11 o'clock. The noise level on the Yamaha is pretty good too, there is still some hiss present, but you can only hear it in a small room. The Behringer had a bit more hiss.

The way Yamaha designed the external power supply was a surprise to me. You plug it in and screw it on so that it's secure and doesn't get accidentally pulled out during a gig. The cable has more than enough length as well. I like how the phantom power is located on top of the mixer and easy to access, which I like better than Behringer, where they put it next to the ON/OFF switch, which may cause someone to accidentally turn off the mixer during live use.

A couple things I wish it had was a Pre-Fade Listen mode and LED indicators for the Pad buttons, as it is sorta hard to tell if the Pad is on or off, and when you're trying to work on the fly, this may not be helpful. I accidentally had the PAD switch down on one of the mono mic channels and was wondering why I was getting a low signal during sound check.

Haven't used the USB feature for recording yet. Will update when I get a chance. But for a great clean live sound, these will do the job. Very portable as well. I was able to fit it in a suitcase style laptop bag.

The way Yamaha packaged the mixer was more secure than the Behringer as well. You can tell they put some serious thought into so many aspects of this mixer.

*My review is based on a single use at an outdoor event for an acoustic trio, with a QSC K10.

EDIT: This one is a keeper for my home studio audio interface as it's been really stable so far with my Macbook Pro running on OS Maverick 10.9.5. But I think I'm gonna get the 12XU for live shows and as additional mixer to my studio.",1
1284,its ok,1
1285,Meh. Not impressed. Would not nut it again.q,1
1286,Would be 5 stars except the threshold and attack delay don't really go to zero.  Bugs me a lot.,1
1287,Picks fall out when moving around. Needs more grip on the pick.,1
1288,"I got one of these several years ago because hum is a big problem where I live. I tried this out in the store with a clean sounding stratocaster and yeah, it worked, so I took it home. There, I tried it with a distorted sound and you could really tell it was sucking something out of my guitars low end sound. I would like this thing if I could just dial in a little of it. I may try it with a Boss EQ after it to see if it will bring back some of the lost tone. Try before you buy. I could actually see putting this in an effect send/return and eek it in as needed.",1
1289,"I originally purchased this for my Taylor 150E 12 string. However the spring in these capos just does not simply have enough tension for 12 string guitars, the strings move into each other and are held there by the capo creating a buzzing sound. The product works fine for a 6 string.",1

1292,"If you're looking for studio quality sound absorption, this is not your foam.  I used spray adhesive and mounted them on a wood board pre-sprayed with rubberized paint for extra absorption. I'd rated it a 5 out of 10. Not adequate for professional work though.",1
1293,Bought these because I really like the thinner Clayton picks I think they are .90 or 1mm thick. Those really work well I bought the heavier picks but the are too dull sounding for me. I like the Dunlop 207s much better for Jazz and bluegrass picking.,1
1294,"These are pretty bright, but quite unpredictable when it comes to controlling them with DMX. I ordered 4 of these lights. One arrived broken and not functional at all, with a frayed power cord and missing the wing nuts. One doesn't respond smoothly to DMX input, and the other two work pretty well. The way the DMX addressing works is really strange - channel 1 controls strobe, but also serves as a on/off channel. Channel 2 is master fader, 3 is R, 4 is G, and 5 is B. It depends on what you need, but in general the quality of these lights is pretty poor.",1
1295,I don't know why but I haven't gotten much use out of this yet but it could be me. You may have better luck.,1
1296,I agree with several people here that the directions are not perfect. I don't what language uses asterisks with numbers to describe the length of the bolts. I received hardware that was of the wrong length to securely fit. I almost returned mine until I decided to go to my local hardware store and search for washers and bolts that are the right length and extra nuts. I also decided to keep it to avoid having to wait on UPS to pick it up. The cushion top is very shiny with the Fender logo. It also has the glitter red on the cushion sides. Mine even swivels. Very nice. I just wish Fender had included the right hardware.,1
1297,"I had a fiddle that absolutely would not respond to anything you did to the pegs, even this stuff. Ended up giving the fiddle away and they turned it into a wall ornament!",1
1298,"I bought it for a simpler drum snake than the 50"" Horizon snake I'd been using. The first time I used it the #7 cable slot release button broke and the cable wouldnt come out. I had to take it apart and break the lock tab on the inside to release the cable. I put it back together and use it without the #7 cable locking now. It'll just have to do for now. Hope no more problems!",1
1299,"The color and the vibe are really cool. However, in terms of sound quality and actually using the product, I tried many different configurations and unless you connect this to a sound system or headphones, it sounds horrible and is a completely useless product. I bought two of these, and the first one I bought I blew the speaker just from turning up the volume on my guitar. I still thought it was a novelty and bought another one. The second held up a little better than the first, but only because I made the mistake previously mentioned.

Honestly, save the twenty dollars and put the money toward either new strings or a real guitar amp.",1
1300,"I am replacing an older Fender gig bag with broken zippers.  This one is a significant downgrade in two ways:

1.) the padding. It is not nearly as thick as the padding in my old case.  Hold the two side by side and you can definitely tell the difference
2.) the handle.  The old case has a velcro wrap to keep the two handles bound together.  Thi sone has no such thing, it's just plain nylon woven strap.

Otherwise it's nice enough, especially for $30.  It'll protect your guitar from scratches, though not really from being thrown down the stairs or something.  Same as the old. The pocket is plenty big enough.  It fits my MIM Stratocaster like a glove.  Just disappointed in the downgrades.",1
1301,"I wanted a small device that I can bring with me with me when I'm away from home, and on vacation, etc., so I can play my electric guitar without having to drag an amp around.  I just want to be able to put my guitar, a few picks, a cord, headphones and a device like this into my case and be ready to play when I'm not home.  So I picked up this device (in this model, above, and also in the Metal model, and Lead model) and another device to test them all.  I would keep the ""winner"" and ship back the rest.  Here are the results of my tests on the devices:

I picked up this little Vox Amplug (in the three units described above) and I also picked up a used Korg Toneworks Pandora PX4 at an auction site for $60 and figured I'd keep whichever one was the best.  NO comparison.  The Vox Amplug units went right back to Amazon immediately (I knew within 2 minutes).  Don't get me wrong, the Vox Amplug units will give you a semi-decent tone to play to, but the Amplug devices are VERY limited in what you can do with it and there really is NOT a range of tones to work with, just either one tone with the gain on, or one tone with the gain turned way down, and a negligible difference in the middle ground (that is, in the gain settings between 1 and 10).  All three of the Vox Amplug models (Metal, Lead, regular Guitar) have essentially the same general tone, and the tone itself is nothing to go crazy over....the ""Lead"" model has delay, but the delay itself is essentially a joke...you cannot adjust the delay level at all, and is a very thin delay, barely there and barely noticeable!  You can turn down the gain (to its lowest level) on the units and get a semi-decent cleaner tone, but nothing to go crazy over.  The  amplug feels sort of flimsy in its overall make too, kind-of lightweight with thin plastic. Very delicate. Going from the Vox Amplug to the Korg PX4 is like going from a barebones early model Hyundai Elantra to a plush, cushy Cadillac; yes, the Elantra will get the job done, and get you from point A to point B, so to speak, but it's just NOT that exciting.  I'm having a field day with the PX4 and my headphones though---and with the PX4 unit that I reviewed you can customize your tones and make tons of different great combos using different amps, cabs, reverbs, mods, delays, effects, etc....plus the PX4 has built-in drum and bass loops of all different styles to play to...plus you can record your own loop, and then jam over that, too....and also run an external device into it (cd or mp3 player)...the PX4 is an amazing little device, the Vox Amplug is definitely not....

So the Vox Amplug units are ""okay"" but it was a no-brainer for me to return them and I can't say enough good things about the device I'm using instead, the Korg PX4 (you can get a PX5 on this site too, or pick up a used PX4 or a similar device with WAY more features than the Vox Amplug).  With the Vox Amplug, you'll have fully explored all of its capabilities and features in about 1-2 minutes.  With the PX4, you will exploring it (in an enjoyable way) for hours and enjoying its vast amount of great features---the PX4 is really exciting to use and the amplug is NOT.

It was a slam-dunk decision to get rid of the Vox Amplug units and to use a WAY better device:  Something to think about if you're considering the Vox Amplug.

And, in final summary of the Vox Amplug units:

PROS:
**Convenient, plugs right in and simple to use

CONS:
**Very limited in its capabalities---you'll have fully explored its capabilities in less than 2 minutes
**No delay, reverb, or other fun effects  (Vox Amplug ""Lead"" unit has delay, but the delay is a joke--very lame)...No effects, esp. no decent delay or reverb is a major deal killer for me
**Thin, flimsy design;  would probably snap into 5 pieces if you accidentally dropped it from only 5 inches off of the ground
**Small, hard to read writing on the units (for volume, gain, etc.)
**Not that fun or exciting to use
**The unit sounds completely thin and flat without even a hit of reverb or decent delay---- Boo !
**I plugged an mp3 player into the Vox unit, and overall it just seemed to sound like garbage, even after making my best attempt to balance volumes, etc...

Thanks, hope this is somewhat helpful....",1

I wish its shortest setting was a little bit shorter.  The height adjustment component is plastic and feels a bit cheap, but I haven't had a problem with it not holding.  Doesn't come with a clip, but all my microphones have their own clips, anyway.  One other slightly annoying thing is the big sticker on the shaft.  It doesn't affect the function, but it's ugly.",1
1309,"These are a little course for what I wanted. Brass is a lot better, and the edges are too sharp for fast picking. They may be giving the strings a little premature wear, and the loss of tonality is the problem. There are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm.",1
1310,"Don't get me wrong, it does have a tad warmer sound than what you get out of your typical ""non tube"" amp but the trouble of hooking it up and going through the motions almost isn't worth it.  I did say ""Almost"".  It's a good pedal for the price.  It does give you a deeper sound and it doesn't sound phoned in like a lot of pedals do at this price.  If you don't have a tube amp and you wanna experiment with a slightly warmer sound this pedal is probably a dream come true.  For your wallet and you.  Depending on what  kind of guitar you play on, pickups you have in it and amp you use though, it might not be for you.  Then again, it's like 12 bucks for this thing and I don't think any guitarist will lose much sleep over it at night.

It's an average  pedal at a steal of a price.  We'll put it that way.  There are better pedals to be had that will give you this sound and more but you'll be paying 100+ for them and the bells and whistles it has that that one doesn't.  Decide what's best for you and jump inn.",1

One was a damaged D-string, not a big deal, happens to wire wrapped strings & easy to replace. But, 2nd buzz was on B-string, very bad, right up by nut. Tries to tame it, but likely need a luthier to fix -- so ended up returning it. Mine may have been an outlier, but was enough for me to decide to either go with a low end model that costs less than 1/2 or step-up to a true Kala KA-15B Baritone Ukulele for $40 more.",1

Too bad it doesn't have some variable output control for that situation...",1
1328,"Well as i read the other reviews.. I heard it was pretty much going to be ""Bad packaging"" and ""Missing picks"". I myself decided to go with pure luck and but it anyways. First of all.. Delivery. It was delivered 5 days before it was supposed to. 5 starts for that. Packaging.. The box was way to big! and when you would tilt the box a little you could hear all the picks inside sliding around inside the box.. Which is pretty much horrible.

They bowed the neck a bit, which I readily resolved with the truss rod, but they sounded rather dull and flat to my ears, nothing like what a Telecaster should sound like.

I do like how these sound, but I actually had a string break this time while stretching them.  The last time that happened was when I found some really cheap strings and thought I'd check them out just in case they sounded good.  So in the end, I threw away all these strings and went back to my d'addarios.  They do sound good.",1
1347,I guess I got what I paid for. It's really flimsy and won't stay upright for long but I guess it does the job...,1
1348,"This stand is very light weight, very portable and very easy to assemble. It can hold two heavy lights or four light lights (ie par cans) with no problem. Its weight limit is 40 pounds, however; so you have to make sure that the total weight of your cables, fixtures etc. is not too much, or you are asking for an accident. If you want something more road-worthy and flexible for Djing & entertainment applications, you can find a 100 pound capacity stand for not much more money. If you want something light and quick for less demanding applications, this is an inexpensive and reasonably manufactured solution.",1
1349,"These strings are fine. The oxidize quickly and loss tone fast, but they are cheap and reliable.",1
1350,"These Martin M190 strings sound nice and bright. I rarely have strings break, but these seem more brittle and susceptible to breaking. I've had 4 strings from my last several packs break. When changing strings and unwinding from the posts they easily break off. Time to try something else.",1
1351,Not well shielded. Will work in an application that doesn't require special shielding. Length is good for lots of different applications.,1
1352,"this pedal worked well, but I sent it back because thru my marshall it
generated a lot more line noise than I like, other than that it was cool!!!!",1
1353,"Pros: Cheap, seems reliable, sturdy.

Cons: Poor design, not ""Black velveteen rubber"" as stated; Just foam. Stand does not sit level and guitars want to lean constantly even on a perfectly level floor (yes, I got out a level to make sure my house is not crooked).

I have had better stands like a Hercules, but I have also had bargain stands that I wouldn't trust to hand my jeans on. Right now I have two different $700 ESP Ltd guitars on it. Not sure if I would trust it with a $2000 Japanese ESP tho.",1
1354,"Again, another item I bought so long ago, I barely remember doing so. I purchased this for my granddaughter to use with an old Korg tuner on an acoustic guitar that didn't have a pickup. I doubt she still uses either. ;)",1
1355,"Nice and functional. Not especially good or bad, but they do what they are supposed to do. Wish they came with instructions or recommendations.",1
1356,"A good mute. However, it's getting floppy and does not stay in place now after minimal use. Maybe need to reevaluate the material being used? IMO, it's too soft.",1
1357,"Not the best, but you get what you pay for.",1
1358,I bought this to see if I could build a guitar and it turns out that I can't but this was still pretty good quality. It looks nice.,1
1359,"This is OK, but after it's installed, you have the feeling that there was a bit too much hype.  You get a basic kit that has pretty good sounds, but then find that all the cool stuff is in add-on (and pricey) packages.  If this drum kit is good for all your sounds, and it could be, then you're set.  I would probably not buy this if I had to start over.",1
1360,"NOT FOR PRO USE, GREAT FOR EXPERIMENTING, GREAT SOUNDS, WILL NOT GO WELL LIVE OR IN THE STUDIO.",1
1361,"I bought this because we love music and this is definitely small enough for our travels.  The kids lost interest quickly and it feels a little cheap.  The sound is ok, but not great.  The one review with the girl playing (no distortion) got it right as far as sound clarity.

I do not own any other wind instruments of this sort and I'm not proficient at playing this instrument.",1
1362,Works great as a portable recorder. I'm disappointed otherwise. Interface is not simple. Dead-Cat is needed.,1
1363,"I really wish i could give these bad boys 5 stars, but the manufacturer really skimped out on some capacitors, and left many consumers with the same problem: Either one speaker is louder than the other, or the switch to toggle between which is L and which is R is not well built, which leads to them not working.

As I'm sure you can tell from the other reviews here, it takes about a year for these problems to manifest, so for about a year you get some awesome, high performance speakers with a lot of depth.",1
1364,Item as described.,1
1365,"Some days it works great. Other times, no.

Yes, there is a latency issue. And yes, the light is SO annoying and will not stop rapidly blinking.

Solutions: plug it in BEFORE you open up your DAW. If that doesn't work, just unplug and replug. Usually that fixes it on logic. But I know people who have used it and couldn't fix any of the issues. Also, I literally just put duct tape over the light. Honestly, it's that annoying and useless.

If you know how to put up with the BS then it's certainly a good value. I've made some good-sounding things with this without hardly spending any money.",1
1366,I loved the tone but these rusted in about 7 hours of playing. The competition lasts longer with the exact same tone.,1
1367,Basic grear that's kind of worth getting.,1
1368,"Pros...So Far so good. I upgraded from a 16 bit interface so this device is a lot more clear. Pretty much plug and play. Using windows 10 you have to download the drivers from Behringers website and manually install.  There is minimal latency at playback and none observable while monitoring. Super clear with no noise using balanced cables,minimal footprint on desk and for this price and the features included you can not go wrong.....

Cons...I had to call Behringer costumer service to verify this but the UMC404HD is not usb bus powered solely. Meaning the AC power adapter has to be plugged into a wall for the unit to function. Little disappointed about this considering it is not accurately mentioned in the description. Which led me to my next question. Will keeping the device plugged in with the ac adapter for an indefinite amount of time damage the device or cause over heating.. They said they were not sure but they didn't think it would harm the device. I guess will wait and see.",1
1369,"Got the correct product except the picture shows the ""Level 360"" version and I received the old version that didn't have the Evans 360 technology. I'll see if I can get the Level 360 version from the seller",1

1371,"This is not isolated as they advertise. It is really a glorified daisy chain, however I do believe it is better. I prefer this since I can mount it, also i can run dedicated power lines to each of my pedals. Having a dedicated 250mah channel is also very nice for my Strymon pedals.",1
1372,"Quality not the best, but will work as needed, as long as it is gently used. I expect it to wear out quickly with a lot of use.",1
1373,Nice sound but not that amazing for the $250.  Softer sound that $100 ones here and the first few frets on the 2nd string are 20 cents too sharp which is not acceptable to my ears.,1
1374,"Although Planet Waves is typically budget musician equipment, I usually find their products are solid and withstand the test of time.

I can't really vouch for the ""test of time"", but this leather strap is sub par to the others I own. My Gibson and Levi's straps use soft, inner leather, whereas IF this strap is leather, it's an uncomfortable outer leather.

It's very firm - I play a featherweight parlor guitar and this strap still cuts into me. I can't even imagine how the weight of a solid body guitar would feel.

Does it serve its intended purpose? Yes. Is it a comfortable, superior product? No. It does what it's supposed to do, and thats it.",1
1375,It wouldnt work with windows 10 so I returned it. It seemed to be made well .,1
1376,"I love this pedalboard! It is a great size in that it can fit a decent collection of small to medium sized pedals, and is big enough to mount a power supply. It is also small enough to go on a flight as a carry-on, but beware: the gig bag is not built to last. The fabric is sturdy and water resistant, but the zippers just don't last. Within months I had a wonderful pedalboard with no gig bag, and am looking at having to pay more than I paid for the board to get a decent case to put it in. Save yourself the headache, and get the flight case. It may be heavy, but it won't break so easily.",1
1377,"I love D'Addario strings, and I love performing on fresh strings! As a gigging, weekend, musician, I'm changing strings on 1 or 2 guitars a week.  However, when I purchased this, I wasn't aware that the strings were not completely sealed. They are packaged in such a way that all strings of one gauge are together... you just grab the ball end and pull a string out of the roll/bunch.  They are not sealed individual sets!
I'm not sure if I can use these fast enough before any tarnish might start to set in. So unless you're changing a lot of strings, in a reasonably short time frame, I might suggest paying a bit more for the 10 pack of individually sealed sets.",1
1378,"The claims that the piano synth is better than the Casio is a little over stated but this keyboard definitely has some mild advantages over the 61 key Casio keyboards. There's only one piano sound and it's good, but in 2016 it could really be better.

Also, the fact that it doesn't come with a power chord is obnoxiously absurd.",1
1379,"Pretty solid, but my old noise cancelling Sony ear buds did a better job blocking out sound.",1
1380,"Not really a fan.  The 18:1 tuner part is great, but the locking mechanism here is kind of a pain, and I wish I had held out and waited for the normal thumb-wheel style locking tuners to get back in stock (I ordered these because the other style was out of stock).

First, I find it very tedious to get the strings fed through the small holes (much smaller than normal holes in tuners).  Second, my high E string keeps slipping out (it doesn't break, it slips out of the lock) unless I wrap it a couple of times around the post like it was a normal tuner, but due to the straight post and the angle of the strings on my guitar, that leaves it prone to come out of tune when the string slips up/down on the post.

YMMV",1
1381,"Bought for my two keyboards to protect them from dust and scuffing. Fits snugly, however, some dust still gets through.",1
1382,"I bought the black ones as well, which are thicker, and I like them better than the clear ones.  My teeth are sensitive and these keep the mouthpiece in better shape, and my teeth don't hurt when I play!",1
1383,The mouthpiece showed an asymmetric tip rail and was cut off center. This is not good because it would not allow the reed to vibrate properly. Really unexpected from a reputable brand as Yamaha. I returned it.,1

1387,"It's pretty, but does it play well? If you want a real harp and you (or your child) want(s) to truly learn to play a real harp, then do NOT consider this product or, in our opinion, anything in the Mid-Eastern line as a student starter instrument. Do not consider any ""harp"" that has less than 26 strings for real harp study; otherwise, you will experience frustrating limitations. (See my info below for some suggestions on that!) Basically, this Lily Harp is an expensive-to-buy, cheaply-made, but beautiful decoration that can potentially be used as an interesting toy harp with extremely limited musical merits and / or as a prop in a theater production or as an interesting classroom prop / conversation piece--which was my purpose for buying it. This Lily harp might make an interesting accessory for an Angel or Medieval costume. People who may wish to decorate food/ gift tables for holiday events or weddings might enjoy this as center display. If you are not too serious about the harp or music, it might make a fun amusement to play around with for fun.

As another reviewer commented, it does have difficulty in regards to tuning, and the strings are quite eager to slips (losing the tuning easily) or snap, even if one is careful and using the chromatic tuner and tiny adjustments. Tuning this is an exercise in patience and using the electronic tuner! :) This harp does come with a tuning tool and extra strings; however, there is no documentation on using either of these resources. In fact, the product ships with no documentation whatsoever. So, someone totally new to harps would be quite at a loss if he / she didn't have some source like ""You Can Play The Harp."" Should you run through your replacement strings, you might find it difficult to acquire more especially for this product...the strings designated only for Lily Harp.

The harp's sound isn't unpleasant, but it is very toyish. [You can go to You Tube and hear someone plucking a little song on this harp.] In fact, First Act's ""lap harp"" sounds more like a real instrument than this Lily harp. Serious music people and hard core harp lovers would be appalled by the sound and inconsistencies! LOL :) The harp does have colored strings for C and F strings, So, it is trying to mimic big true harps in a limited sense. Small hands could do limited placing exercises. However, don't be fooled though; this product is more of a harp wannabe than a genuine harp for serious music students. It's like harp art if your will--rather like a large, cool ornament. You can't expect to get genuine concert music from something that is only $35, this size, and made in Pakistan. [No offense to anyone is intended here.]

I knew these things going into the purchase of this item. So, why did I buy?? My reasons were simply--I liked the look of it as far as an ornament / classroom prop went. I was going for harp art rather than music here! I wanted something small and suggestive of a harp for my lesson display purposes. Something that could be examined, fingered, and held without any worries. :D However, I thought I would write this review just in case others were looking at this product as a student's ""intro"" instrument. If you truly want an honest-to-goodness beginner's harp, you should investigate the Harpsicle line of Rees Harps. Just type ""Harpsicle"" in your Amazon search. Yes, they are much more expensive than the Mid-Eastern and other products, but what your getting with the Harpsicle is a better quality instrument with potential. It is an instrument that has a reputation with Harp Therapy and wellness endeavors. There are several versions of Harpsicles with various features. You may wish to google Harpsicles and read about each of the choices to ensure you select the instrument that matches your harp goals. If you go to the Harpsicles official webpage, you can hear the instrument and read an excellent FAQ page.

LILY HARP PROs

It is very pretty. I love the color and the shape of it as a decoration / prop. The Knotwork design is most pleasing to the eye. The harp has an ""old world"" feel. It's stands up very well and is sturdy, no wobbles. It's a non-threatening thing, allowing one to observe the major parts of a harp. It's simply fun to poke around with it so long as you remember not to become too serious. You can render a light-hearted ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" or ""Kum Ba Ya"" with Lily Harp. [Remember, it only has eight strings! So simple, simple songs...] It does make people smile because it looks so sweet and approachable. // It does have the possibility of simple tuning if one works around its issues; with patience and an electronic chromatic tuner with a pickup, we were able to tune it enough to make recognizable ""toy"" music.

LILY HARP CONS
It's musically challenged as mentioned above...with temperamental strings that like to slip and / or snap. It is not a ""beginning"" or ""intro"" harp for the student who truly wants to learn to play an instrument. It's a bit pricey for what it is. Tuning tries one's patience. It may be confused with real ""lap harps."" Being small, it only represents one octave.

Our advice is to never buy any musical instrument without reading about it, without researching. :) Decide on your purpose for buying and then locate the product that best fits your criteria.",1
1388,little to thick to push through strings,1
1389,"Not as good as I thought. When it arrived it was a little sticky, but now it has dried up, also it broke on one corner very easily.
I think I will try hill next time the dark one.",1
1390,Good for lightweight microphones or pop screens ONLY. Too much weight makes it topple-over. Ultra small size. Nice that someone makes it.,1
1391,"Does what is advertised...but...for $13, I got the joyo tube drive model about a year ago and it is almost as nice.  The vox has a little less noise, but I hardly notice once I'm playing.  The vox has the on-board rhythms, but I find them to be somewhat limiting.  They both have ipod input jacks, so I end up using backing tracks, you tube, or ireal anyway when I practice. The sound quality is almost exactly the same between this and the joyo, but the joyo has a gain knob that can add some distortion if you want. Overall...I don't think this is a bad unit, but I would strongly recommend the joyo at a much lower price.",1
1392,This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it.,1
1393,"Not a bad pedal for the price. There are definitely better ones on the market, but this guy is built to las tand is very fun to mess around with. I'm not a gear snob so I enjoy this pedal for the kind of music that I make.",1
1394,"It'll get the job done, but honestly seems to be cheaply built for a hand tool.  Feels a bit flimsy.",1
1395,"the cable is meh.... Probably would be a lot better off ordering 20ft of good cable, 2 decent jacks, and taking 5 minutes to solder the connections myself",1
1396,"I probably play a bit to aggressively for these. They provided the volume reduction and sound I wanted for a small room, but they fell apart on me really quickly. I suggest others take a look at products from FLIX. I have had a ton of success with those.",1
1397,"I have had mine for 3 years. I wish there was a 3.5 rating I could give it. I experienced the cable breaking like many others, so I have to squeeze the sides together using brute force, but it still functions and is pretty easy. I load two guitar amps, pedalboard, extra's cases, two guitars and sometimes load extra stands and/or an indoor/outdoor rug onto this thing and strap them down. It pushes fairly easily, unless you get into gravel or taller carpet. It has honestly been a life saver. I cannot talk badly about it, even with it's flaws. For half of the cost of the other options (which I'm going to upgrade to now - only after 3 years and many, many, many gigs) it certainly gave me my money's worth.

If you have a serious need for a cart that you are going to use a ton, I'd look at the 'other brand', but if you need an occasional hand with some heavier items, this would be a good buy for the money!",1
1398,"Not bad. Fairly good initial sound but within a couple of days quite dead.

I went back to my John Pearse 200L 80/20's. No matter how many different strings I try I come to the same conclusion; The Pearse 200L's are the best strings in the world.",1
1399,"Works just fine. Good length, good signal, sturdy but flexible. Definitely recommended. Pork milk porucpine honk honk pimple honk honk.",1
1400,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago. I used it to connect my Behringer BCR2000 (in MIDI mode, naturally!) to my computer for mixing duties in REAPER. It worked with no issues and I had zero complaints.

A few weeks ago it stopped working (I had bent the USB connector and so I thought that was the culprit) so I bought another.

The replacement arrived and installed with no issues, but I'm still having trouble getting it to send MIDI data into the computer. MIDI out of the computer to the Behringer is fine. I'm not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky Windows update that's happened lately, but it's certainly not ideal! :(

In my haste, having seen it install OK but without trying to actually use it, I discarded the packaging. Unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit, so now it looks like I'm stuck with two possibly-broken USB / MIDI interfaces. I have reinstalled Windows, tried both with another computer, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, all kinds of good stuff and I still can't get either of them to send MIDI data into the computer. I was v-e-r-y close to throwing my Behringer unit away as I thought it was broken too!

Thankfully I tried an old Yamaha interface and it is OK. This means I just need to get and buy some MIDI cables and I'll be back in business.

So, I'd say buy one of these, and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away! When they work they're absolutely great and they're SO cheap! If you receive a lemon, return it and order another. It's worth it if you're not in a hurry. If you *are* in  a hurry then order a few of them, or just get something else.

I'd also like to advise people that reports of MIDI latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer. I strongly suspect that the speed of transferring MIDI data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think, and the actual latency you're experiencing is that of converting your MIDI data into audio. This happens inside your computer and has **nothing** to do with this device's performance; it's purely down to your hardware and software configurations. All this talk of ASIO is only really going to help you on the audio side of things. If you're using this device to record MIDI data then you should have no issues at all... as long as you get one that works! :-)

Cheers.",1
1401,"I had this pedal sitting in my closet for years. After finding a FAB Echo and liking it a lot for sweetening a single-channel dry tube amp that didn't offer on-board reverb several years back, I'd  picked up this overdrive wondering if it would make me as happy as the Echo. Initially, not so much. Flash forward to the present and I had just switched out the Duncan pickups in my favorite Strat for some EMG DG20s. I had been running the Strat through a Tube Screamer to get its output up to where my LP is and for a little EQ balancing on the Duncans, too. But the DG20s on-board EQ boosters didn't really play well with the Tube Screamer--they worked against each other. I started researching some other ODs and in the meantime, dug this FAB out of the closet just to see how the DG20s liked it. I was completely shocked to find that they LOVED it! Not in a way that would please every guitarist, but it sure pleased me. If I could rename the pedal and rehouse it in a metal enclosure, I'd call it the ""Molasses Overdrive"" and get some boutique money for it ;)

I hadn't liked the pedal before because it's dark and completely destroys string separation. For my LP and my Duncan-equiped Strat, that was a bad thing. But it plays great with the more sterile DG20s. This Dano pedal more than doubles the output hitting the amp and pushes my signal into really thick, sustain-for-days saturation at a very low overall volume. It's magical! I would definitely not recommend this pedal as the first overdrive you buy or reach for. But with the right rig and in the right situations, such as during a solo where all you want is single notes to hammer through the mix and keep singing for days, this is a great pedal.",1
1402,"This was the first pedal I ever bought back when I knew nothing about pedals, amps, tone, or even what true bypass meant. Looking back I was really oblivious and hoped to turn my Fender modeling amp into an 80's Marshall tube amp. With that said, this isn't a bad pedal looking back on it. If you're really into a hard crunchy distortion like 80's glam metal, or even some thrashier hard rock with lots of sustain, then this would be up your alley. The thing I really didn't care for, other than the sound (that style of music wasn't my cup of tea), was that this pedal was a bit touchy when it came to placement on the ground. Maybe my pedal was defective, maybe it was the amp I was using; though I tried it with other amps and it resulted the same, maybe it was a combination of things, but this pedal, when placed anywhere near the amp on the ground would start ringing really loud, like when you put a microphone or something magnetic near a speaker. If you lifted off the ground or moved it across the room with a really long cable, the ringing would stop, but if ambient a few feet away from the amp and it would produce a noise like on David Cornenberg's Scanners that would make your head want to explode.",1
1403,"Not a great unit, slow to respond.",1
1404,The design is very practical. But it doesn't seem durable and some parts came with rust.,1

1412,"I have a MIM Telecaster, makes a hum with the stock pickups, this helps remove that hum and thats what I wanted it for. Seems to be a great little footswitch, had a dead battery when it arrived and it took me a little while to figure that out. Also was advertised as coming with a cable, but that wasn't included. --- After reading the instructions it says to replace the battery, wonder why they don't include a good battery when they send them out, or at least remove the battery to eliminate confusion like I had when it wouldn't work.
But then I'm kind of a confused guy anyway.",1
1413,"Alright let's get right into it.... I will be separating this review into sections to make it short and sweet.

Before I even get started, I got these speakers in three days shipped via FedEx and wow it was fast the boxes were shipped in the Rockville packaging.... was expecting another box covering that but I guess everything is fine.

Build Quality 7/10
They are made out of plastic but seem strong... but come on, it's plastic. If you drop these things you will get a crack or a huge scratch/scuff in the speaker no questions asked.

Value 10/10
I can't believe how cheap these things are selling for, they really should be selling these for $600+ just wait another year, guarantee these will be around that price range. You will not find a pair of speakers, stands, and XLR cables for under $400

Sound Quality 6.5/10
When I set these things up there was one thing I noticed.... The highs are WAY WAY WAY TO BRIGHT! the highs are set extremely loud I have them turnt down to -6-7db to make them sound equalized to the mids and lows. Now let me say this, these are pretty loud! They won't distort your ears but they will put out some serious sound. The mid sections are okay I guess. Could be better but are good enough. The low ends are nice. They are good for small parties and maybe a small wedding but for something professional like a school dance, party of 150+ or large wedding, you'll need a bass bin. These sound okay. I'll have to update you if anything changes.

Overall 7/10
These sound good and put out some serious sound. The stands are VERY high quality as is the speaker. If you are looking for the best and cheapest 15"" DJ speakers, look no further, Rockville is here!",1
1414,"Not bad for the money, and it can be run on batteries. It would have been a better deal with the A/C adapter. I bought a Snark for an extra $10.",1
1415,"Decent starter uke. Doesn't stay in tune well, but neither do the kids playing it.",1
1416,"pickup toggle nut was loose on arrival, setup was not great, but damn it looks good! will replace the pickups.",1
1417,All of these are about the same. Minnesota winter ruin Guitars. These will help that from happening.,1
1418,"These things are OLD. That must be why they aren't too expensive. Foam degrades over time because of the components in the air we breathe (Ozone, an unstable molecule, normally bonds with foam, oxidizing and destroying it and freeing the 03 to be 02). These things have clearly been sitting for a while, because they have that characteristic ""crunchy"" feel when you squeeze foam and it's turning into dust.

They went up without a hitch and look good, but the thinness of the product precludes any real noise prevention. The only thing these do is break up reflected audio so you don't hear room-reverb or an echo.

Would I recommend them to a friend? If I were mad at them I would. Otherwise only the most inexperienced would appreciate them. My recording studio and musician friends would likely say ""No way, they're too thin and they're crunchy too!""

I'll put up with that. For now.",1
1419,SEEMS OK,1
1420,"I have owned this stand for almost 2 years with light usage.  First impressions were fantastic.  This stand is very impressive visually compared to the cheaper stands I was used to in the past. Initially, my only issue was the fact that the tuning keys on my banjo are such that the arms that support the headstock tend to press on the tuning keys, knocking it slightly out of tune when the stand is holding the instrument.  Not a fault of Hercules, mind you, but typical of any ""hanging"" type stand.  As a previous reviewer stated:  know your instruments before purchasing this stand.

The rationale behind my 3 star review is based on the nut behind the tension screw which holds the stand in an extended position while in use.  The nut has fallen off and I am currently using a wing nut as a replacement, but it is not ideal.  It does not feel as stable as the original equipment and is a nusiance.  When I visited the Hercules website under the ""Contact Us"" section to inquire about a replacement nut, there is a message that states that the page is under construction and that all questions should be directed to your local distributor.  Compared to the competition, this is a high priced stand.  I would expect that Hercules would offer some level of support directly to the consumer.",1
1421,"i know these stands were very cheap and I wasn;t expecting much, but they don't go very high, and when they are at max height, they lean. Not enough to make it fall, but enough to make it look unprofessional.",1
1422,These are better than moon gel because they are clear and round. They don't stay on the resonant head very well though which takes a star off. Also they don't come in a case but are instead stuck between two plastic sheets which takes off another. Price is high as well. Drum dots are the best from what I hear.,1
1423,My old standby.....was able toget 3 good ones out of the box......about average for a box of ten.,1
1424,"I bought this guitar for my son as a stater guitar for him.  The first one I got looked as if the box was dropped on the bottom and the guitar hit the strap button and chipped a large amount of the finish off.  Sent it back the next was was flawless in the finish we done. The fret work was well done.  The tuners are ok not great.  The pots are TERRIBLE I had to replace them all.  Also they had the whole thing wired wrong.  And I'm not sure how this guitar ever made it out of the factory QC.  But for 200 what do you expect I guess.  Other than that pots and wiring issue.  After getting that fixed, and a decent set up, the guitar pickup are decent sounding.  My kid loves it and it is a good upgrade platform for a decent price.",1
1425,"OK BUT, SOUND IS SUBPAR.",1
1426,"I have really small fingers, but their even medium is still pretty tight. If you don't have really small fingers like a young Korean boy, you'll probably want to get the large. Doesn't pluck well on nylon either. These are strictly steel string.",1
1427,"Excellent pair of all around hi hats that fit nicely with all music styles.

+'s:  versatility, cut through, bright, nice chickiness to them, powerful, get loud and slushy when you open them up, sound beautiful, last forever (never heard of or had any issues with them cracking or chipping, i had mine for over 10 years and they still held up like new).

-'s:  a little too bright even for an A custom, overpowering when played openly (particularly in recordings with a snare mic nearby, but you can fix that when you mix and equalize the sound levels), for about the same price you can get the mastersound version of these which has ridges along the rim on the inside and will prevent choking and add really nice sound qualities to the hats.

General comments:  I think they can become a bit dull once their shine wears off. I played my pair for 10 years before I decided it was time to sell them and get something with a more unique sound.  I found myself wanting more of a cutting chick sound without all the brightness that these hats offer. After playing them for so long my bottom hat was still nice and shiny and new and the top hat was a whole different color, I didn't have time to clean them constantly but I felt that the two (bottom and top) hats started to clash in a way I didn't like because of the different amount of wear on each side.  They were a great pair of hi hats to grow with as a drummer because it gave me a really good idea of what I liked and didn't like in a hi hat, yet were solid and worked great with all music I played whether it was jazz or metal...so it gave me a chance to stick with one solid and long lasting nice sounding hats until I learned exactly what sound I wanted.  If you are still in your early years of playing this is a good pair to venture out with and will sound awesome, or if you are a pro and just want a bright, powerful pair of cutting hi hats that don't sound too generic or too out of the box, these will serve you well too.  One last thing I would suggest is to check out the mastersound a custom hi hats - essentially the same hats but with the ridges upgrade and they are around the same price as these hi hats.",1
1428,It's ok...works most of the time but doesn't always hold all the strings down. spend more money if you're playing a lot.,1
1429,ok for price,1
1430,Not as good as my Snark.,1
1431,"I bought this for my GF to use with a Selmer #3 tenor sax mouthpiece. This ligature fits that mouthpiece perfectly.

She has since moved on to a metal mouthpiece which came with a metal ligature. She likes the metal one better, says it is easier and faster for her to get the reed lined up exactly the way she likes it.

After experimenting with five mouthpieces (2 plastic and 3 metal) she has settled on a metal mouthpiece with a metal ligature, she says that combination gives her the most expressive and dynamic control of any we've tried.

Nothing wrong with this Rovner ligature, just no clear advantages for her.

Good music to all!",1

1434,The concept is great but you really need a super computer for it to work well. There is a lag. The bundled software is difficult to download in such large files and you will need assistance in getting it installed without conflicts. The pickup snaps into place which is a great improvement over a GK3 for Roland synths. It's pricey and the software perhaps should be streamlined for better response.,1
1435,"Fit straight onto my Gibson SG without using the included posts.  Also installed one on an epiphone wilshire-needed the included posts.  I know this is a copy of the wilkinson design, and setting the intonation is a biatch.  Kind of a silly design really.  That being said, it's less than 10 bucks and makes my guitar way more comfortable to play.  It's at least better than the old TOM bridge I had, but not the be-all-end all solution I was looking for.  One of the bridges I received came with the allen wrenches, one did not.",1
1436,ok,1
1437,"Decent MIDI controller, but this is most definitely NOT for the novice!  I've never attempted to map any sort of device before, so a lot of what this instrument offers is well out of my league.
For use with DAW software (namely Sony Acid, FL, Magix, & various others), I've had a lot of headaches trying to simply get it to respond, let alone record. It does respond when I am using Finale '08, but it does not register proper note length, only the notes played. In this program, every single note plays nothing but 8ths, and does not register any rests at all.
I have also used this controller with DEMOs of Ableton Live and Reason, and had much better results~  Mostly due to the fact that they are already preprogrammed into the keyboard.  My next investment will most likely be Reason
As many others have noted, the pads are very stiff and incredibly unresponsive, so an APC is a better choice for that use (if you must stick with Akai). I've since started buying products from Korg, and I much prefer their quality and versatility.",1

1442,"The Digitech vocalist live 4 does have a lot of bells and whistles, however, there are a few problem areas.  I tried two different units because I wasn't satisified with the first one I received.  Both worked exactly the same.  Called Digitech and they were of no help whatsoever, just implied that the ""new"" version (rack version) had a different pre-amp and my problem would be resolved ""if"" I upgraded (hey, I just bought the damn thing).  I have several guitars, all newer technology, finer instruments and I could not always input a signal that would be strong enough without a preamp (acording to the manual which implied signal strength via light meter, and of course my ears), which would give you an input light saying that the signal strength is adequate.  I found this to be a pain in the ass, to say the least.  All of a sudden a simple connection required another device to go through at an additional expense and more cords.  For those that are not informed, if the signal strength is not strong, you ""will"" eventually go out of tune and it will be noticed unless you are tone deaf.

I like the idea, it works, I'll keep it but it should have been better. Having to buy a pre-amp (I used a Art tube mp) to make it work properly, that simply sucks.  All of my guitars are quality instruments and not outdated.  It just could have been configured with a better pre-amp.  I hate additional cords when not needed.

Now. . . all said and done, this is still a better buy (once configured properly), than the TC version which is about twice of what I paid. I gave it three stars simply for that reason.",1
1443,I can see upgrading soon. I will keep this unit as a back up. The hiss this unit puts out is almost as bad as the buzz from a 60 cycle ground fault. The instruction manual is a fun read.,1

1445,"After playing jazz bass professionally for years this played like a truck but what do you want for the money... But after tweaking the neck,, buying better strings..it plays okay. For the money it's not all bad , I had to tighten all the knobs as they were loose when I got it. any guitar needs to be ""set up "" when you get it.. For a beginner its good but it will need to be set up at a guitar shop locally if you don't know how ( don't try this at home  if you don't know how).. It comes with the tools to do it and You Tube has some great videos on ""Setting up a bass guitar"".. It will need it.. after I adjusted the neck and action it plays ok.. I would have given it 4 stars but I had to basically finish the job they didn't do in the factory.. Like fixing the knobs.. all in all not bad for beginner or intermediate..",1
1446,"I just bought this for fun and to see what a cheap recorder really sounds like. There's some serious pitch issues on some of the notes if you play with proper fingering techniques. Notes are either too flat or too sharp, though a few are dead-on. If you are even slightly serious about music, and you don't want to have messed up pitch, it will be better to spend more for a Yamaha or Aulos for more consistent pitch. You do get what pay for. I just wanted a crystal purple recorder, and I got just that. I'm probably not going to play on it anymore at this point, but it's really pretty.",1

1463,"I hate having to keep my guitar in it's case to use this, so essentially, I bought it and it sits without being used, as I want access to my instrument. I bought a room humidifier instead.",1
1464,"Good, but doesnt last much!",1
1465,"I liked the coating for sliding smoothly up and down strings, and got the custom light gauge to save my fingers while learning. I'd played the guitar for years, but it was a 12 string with half the strings removed for fingerpicking, so the spacing wasn't perfect and when I got the new guitar, I started spending a lot more time practicing.
I had tried a guitar with heavy strings and it sounded great, but killed my finger tips, plus some of the ragtime blues I play requires bending so I started with custom light.
These strings last a long time, but the way I use them the coating gets kind of fuzzy and frays, but that doesn't affect the sound or the ability to keep using them.
These days with the heavier ""light"" uncoated D'Addario, I take a Planet Waves microfiber cloth, hook it under each string one at a time from bass to treble with my little finger, then press the fabric around the string and slide it up and down the length each time after playing. That makes uncoated strings keep great tone a LOT longer. At first you can feel the cloth dragging at certain spots then sliding smoothly. It works, and if you need to clean the cloth it just goes in the washing machine with other clothes, and comes out perfect.",1
1466,"Pretty good product. A little small, and somewhat thin, but the weighted corners are nice. For me, and the way I set up my drums, the bass drum ""stop"" just wouldn't quite work the way I'd have liked it to. For others it may be fine, but it put my throne back just a bit too far off the edge of the rug. I ended up having to use it backwards, with the stop under my throne. Seems to be of decent quality, though very lightweight, and the neutral color is a plus. If you were trying to protect a fairly nice wooden floor, you may have to use an extra layer, but its not bad. I had been using an expensive rug made for a living room floor every weekend under my kit, and its thickness and 5x7 size is great, but its a pain in the ass to carry and weighs a ton.",1
1467,Just not used to it. Haven't used it much. It doesn't feel secure enough.,1
1468,"OK, the whole band bought these things - one of the guys made a bulk order. The light seems great and looks as though it will solve our problem because snaking extension cords for 16 players is a nightmare. Those 9 LEDs really put out. This happened after one of our poorly lit gigs where my tiny Mighty Bright Duet with its little antennae was the only respite. Afterward I researched better options, then as I said one of the guys took the lead to get them.

The question: An adapter is supplied that apparently serves as both charger and on-the-grid power supply. But the directions say very clearly ""Caution: When charging, please make sure the switch is in the OFF position. If you turn on the light when charging, the AC adapter will be easily damaged by strong electricity. Please be careful with this operation.""

So those instructions would seem to eliminate AC, plugged-in use, since that's exactly the same configuration as when you're charging... and obviously you would then turn the light on... which is exactly what the Caution says not to do. Duh? Can anyone figure that out? (PS - you have to stop a minute and think it through!)

Another discrepancy is that the box states ""Powered by AC adaptor or 3X AA batteries"" whereas the slip of paper instructions say ""Powered by AC adaptor or Polymer Lithium Ion Battery"".

I am hoping this nice bright light will work in spite of these not-good signs but do worry about the manufacturer's obvious lack of attention to important details.",1
1469,Sounds O.K.  But the white coating comes off almost immediately.  When I was touring I had to change snare heads every other night.,1

I'm not a big guy either so it's not like my leg would have been particularly heavy. I'm not even super mad about the dollar I wasted, more annoyed that I have a reminder of the dollar I wasted bent into an L shape hanging off the bottom of this thing all the time.",1
1471,pretty nice fuzz. can get nasty....doesnt sit well in a mix for me. Sold mine and bought a Pharaoh. Extremely happy with it.,1
1472,"The pedal is definitely made of lower quality materials / processes than a similar Boss pedal, but I assumed as much going into the purchase.  In particular, the moving pedal part can be slightly wiggled from side-to-side (left to right) with your hand.  That doesn't happen on a Boss pedal, which feels to be made of much thicker, stronger-feeling metal.  I don't have any experience with other noise pedals in this class, so my review is solely based on this purchase, not in comparison to others.

As a mute pedal it works fine.  The noise reduction part is where the 3 stars comes from.  The threshold knob seems to work as I would expect, where turning it up equates to raising the volume level at which it will cut noise out.  The decay knob is the goofy one, and perhaps it's my ignorance...  but my experience is that no matter what I set it to (but particularly higher levels), not only is the decay affected, but the ""attack"" is severely lowered in volume.  For instance, from dead silence to slamming on a loud chord, the volume will start at about 1/2 of what you'd expect (or less), and slowly increase.  That seems wrong to me, but like I said, maybe that's how they are supposed to work.",1
1473,"They are okay.  i like the sound, but i find the treble strings too slinky after a week of playing.  I prefer regular slinky.",1

BUT, they are difficult to manipulate which greatly reduces its usefulness. I found it difficult to plug my inputs/outputs on my pedal board because these are just not bend friendly. The connectors are then protected after the metal with a plastic covering. Again, neat and feels nice and sturdy, but adds to the difficulty of manipulating the cable.",1
1479,"So the one studio monitor that worked sounded great. It has much better quality than the old Logitech computer speakers and woofer that I used in the past. Every syllable spoken is so much clearer with these monitors. Wish I had known about these gems a long time ago. Now on to the monitor that did not work.

When I plugged in the monitors and flipped the switch to the on position to test them the KRK light did not come on. I went to the KRK troubleshooting website and tried all of the suggestions (checking voltage, checking fuse, etc.) and the monitor still did not work. I contacted Amazon for an exchange but unfortunately because the items have magnets in them, Amazon can only provide a refund or credit to my account. So after I received a credit to my account I ended up having to order another studio monitor to replace it. Now I have to wait another 2 weeks for audio from the right channel.",1
1480,"A little ""fappy"" lacking the ""crispness"" of ultex. I realize now that ""fappy"" is a term I have clearly made up. I am saying it doesn't bounce back as quick and stays bent a bit longer than a harder material. The good news is picks are cheap and you should decide for yourself which is best for how (and what) you are playing at the time. I use different picks for some different songs types. They are cheaper that effects boxes. The Shark is a nice grippy feature and as you know sharks must keep moving to stay alive. But having the shark move locations a bit from pick to pick is not ideal. ( see what I did there?). Still worth a shot..just throw the picks you don't like at your adoring fans or just chuck em at your enemies. Either way, win win...Hope this helps.",1

Just to make sure the product you bought is legit or so they claim... I was looking forward to testing out some of the amazing sound packs and synths this product came with, but refuse to be spied on to use it. I own my crap on my PC and I shouldnt have to agree to have a big brother looking over my shoulder, when Im a grown man! That and I bought your product! If I knew about the spyware and lack of trust they have in their consumers, I wouldnt have bought it and with with a different company!

1485,"This might be a good enough fogger for a kids party or small effects, but for an adult or for really good effects this would be inadequate.

We have another fogger, which makes it easy to compare. I thought THAT one was pretty basic, but this is not even that good. First, the machine does not come with even a little sample bottle of fogging liquid, which seems a bit mean. You're all excited to make fog. The box arrives. You tear it open. Oh, mum .... didn't you think to buy fog liquid? No, I thought it would come with some. Oh, mum you're a failure, you are. What a horrible scene -- when you were only trying to do something fun .... ANYWAY, buy some fog-producing liquid when you get this.

Secondly, the reservoir is really small. Also, the power cord and the remote are not detachable and they're very short, so the machine needs to run near an outlet (unless you also get an extension cord when you get the fog liquid) and you have to be quite near the machine to pump the ""remote"". It puts out little puffs of fog every once in a while, but they aren't big enough to make much of an effect, unless you are going for a 'patchy fog' look, and maybe you are. There's nothing wrong with that. Finally, it is VERY noisy as it produces its little puffs of fog! Distractingly loud.

So, in contrast to the basic fogger I already have: this holds less, has shorter cords and is louder.

On the positive side, it has cool blue lights.",1

Even if you hang on to the entire bundle of strings when you attempt to pull out a single string, more than one can and will come out at once, especially on the wound strings. It doesn't happen every time but it does happen. Not a deal breaker but it sure makes a (Bleep!) mess.",1

So inevitably the slide will not be making contact on the highest or lowest string from time to time.

I realize that tone is subjective, but I tried Elixir PBs on two very different guitars (small-body 000 and big ol' dreadnaught), and I didn't care for their sound on either instrument. However, Elixir 80/20s sound great on those same guitars.

Your mileage my vary, but I've spent a lot of years (and money) trying to get good natural and amplified acoustic guitar tone. Strings are a big part of that equation, and for me Elixir phosphor bronze strings didn't cut it.",1

1508,"This unit does what it is supposed to do and does it well.  The pads are fairly responsive and they seem to be pretty sensitive, but I have had a bit of a problem getting ghost notes out of the snare pad.  I have attempted to change the sensitivity, but it is still difficult to get a good feel with ghost notes.  With this said, this product is not very expensive and DOES work very well for less subtle technique.  I have found it to be perfectly fine for straight-ahead playing.

I am using this to program midi drum files in Pro Tools, so I connect it with USB and let the USB port power it.  This is very convenient and simplifies connections by limiting the number of cables running around.  The only problem is a slight delay in response.  You will want to work with it until you figure the offset and play accordingly.

My main complaint about this unit is the size of the pads.  The pads are a bit small if you want to use the unit for fills, or real-time playing.  You will find that the default drum sets have the high hats in strange locations, so you will want to modify the settings to your own taste.  There are some sets in the higher numbers that have the hats on the right, which helps.

The bottom line is that you will have a hard time finding a better unit for the price.

These clamps should be considered the INDUSTRY STANDARD.

UPDATE: Sometimes the camp has a tendency to slip on the pole after you have tightened the wing nut.
A small piece of gaffers tap applied to the inside grip area of the clamp will prevent this.
Try not to over tighten the clamps large wing nut. Over tightening just stresses out the clamp and cuts a groove in the seating surface. If it wants to slip, apply the gaffers tape (as above).

UPDATE No 3: As of 9-16 the price has increased to $12.00+ per clamp! As these continue to rise in price, it may be cheaper to replace the 1"" light stands so the 1"" adapter is no longer needed. Aluminum clamps are WAY less expensive. Why is this clamp so expensive?? Hmmm..",1

The stiffness, size, and all of the other attributes that make it great can all be found in the regular Jazz III pick. For me, the raised surface is like driving on rain grooves. The pick actually gets ""squirrely"" on me. I have medium-sized hands and my grip is not the best to begin with anyway. With the regular Jazz IIIs, on some faster songs it seems I get a kind of ""seal."" I don't get the same seal on the Max Grip.
Also, in hot settings, sweat gets down in the little grooves, making the pick a little slippery. I believe these raised grooves actually reduce the amount of good skin-to-pick surface contact area.
Maybe over time I could adjust but after a few weeks of trying both picks, I am not a fan of the Max Grip.",1
1526,"When the jamstik came out I was so excited the world finally had a compact midi guitar that, supposedly, worked wonders for the expert and the beginner player. I went to the apple store and planned on purchasing it but, before I did, I read the reviews. The reviews were underwelming and the word 'lag' was everywhere. I decided to wait for the next iteration of this potentially amazing instrument.  I waited and waited, then, the Jamistik+ came out.
Granted: I am a guitar noobie; I know how to play chords and strumming patterns but I play mostly acoustic and cannot play solos on electric guitars. That being said: this guitar is not for me, but let's start from the pros.

Positive aspects
The latency in this iteration is negligible. I  experienced lag but only when I was using  bluetooth headset. With wired headphones there was no lag at all. The strings feel like a real guitar. The action is manageable for beginners but you will be sore after a few hours of playing and, of course, since there are real guitar strings you wll have to develope calluses. The fact that you can sound like a piano by playing a guitar is pretty sweet. I was afraid it wouldn't work picking the strings with my fingertips rather than a guitar pick, since I read it in a previous review, but I had no problems once I set the sensitivity to minimum (highest sensitivity). The instrument does not feel like a toy. It is heavy enough to feel sturdy and the battery lasts forever. Easy to pair. Fits in any bag. Light when compared to a normal guitar.

Now for the negative aspects.
I play with my acoustic resting on my leg, the Jamstik+ is too small for that. The Jamstik+ has only 5 functional frets and I relized it was gonna be a problem playing this guitar when I started doing bar chords. The stick it is too short and light to quickly switch to bar chords and back to nornal chords. Also, chords don't sound like chords, they sound like individually played strings but at the same time. On a real guitar the sound from all the strings in a chord blends togheter to form a beautiful, full sound, this felt artificial...well it is artificial.

That being said I feel that, If I was playing solos witha  distorted electric guitar sound, this Jamstik+ would suit my needs. Also, if I would have played with the included strap, standing like you play most electric guitars, I would probably have had a different experience. But I don't play that way,  This stick, as many small keyboards, only has a small range. I undertand that rage is sacrificed for portability and I would have overlooked that if the chords played sounded like chords. But they didn't. Also, there aren't many apps that allow you to use this stick as a midi input but, I haven't tried to look for them that hard so don't uote me on that.

Overall, I have returned the Jamstik+ and purchased a portable guitar from another manufacturer that I will not mention because I deem it desrespectful to Zivix. Zivix is pioneering this sector and I think they are doing an amazing job at it. This time their product did not suit my needs but I will definitely try their next version of this item. I believe in their products and company.",1

I did not realize this when I bought it, but after replacing the batteries a few times I went to a local music store and asked for a light that you could plug in to the AC.  They sold me the Encore model for $35, it is brighter, includes the AC adaptor and a nice carrying case  After I got home I figured out that they sell an optional AC adaptor for the hammerhead for about $10, so for only $5 I could have just bought the Encore model and been better off.  If you are going to get one of these hammerhead lights, go ahead and spring for one that includes the adaptor, it will save you a lot of money in the long run.",1
1531,"I played one at GC two weeks ago.  In search of a new classical.  I have 2 now.  and want a knock around.  First thing I noticed is the nice workmanship.  Very attractive guitar. Next the action ... way too high. Third the sound ... not bad, not great.  Overall a nice guitar but nothing to get excited about.  I was hoping for a broader tonal balance between the lows and highs.  Not that this sounds bad, it doesn't sound bad, it just doesn't sound as good as I was hoping, having read the reviews.  Still a good value for the $$.

3/25/16.  I'm still looking for a good low cost guitar ... hoping to find a  nice used one.  I've concluded that it's very hard to find a really good classical under $1000 and actually closer to $2000.  <sigh>",1

1535,"Like all the other Vine Voice reviewers I was only sent one speaker.  I was really hoping to compare this A-B to my existing pair of consumer grade M-Audio monitors.  The M-Audio's are probably the most popular home/amateur speakers simply because they are affordable.  These RM-O7's are way above my price range.  Heck,  even ONE of these RM-07's cost three or four times as much as a pair of M-Audio's.  And the RM-07 is huge and weighs much much more.  So hey, if you're in the market for a $1500 pair of heavyweight monitors for your pro or semi-pro studio then maybe you'll want to buy yourself a pair of RM-07's.

The subs are plugged into a surge protector outlet strip, which controls when my subs and other media devices come on, and which has the ground prong any way.  Needless to say, you know how inexpensive the 2 prong adapters are, compared to this hum filter.  I suggest others give the cheaper method a try before spending money on this filter.

1544,While I do like it overall as protection for my ukulele I think the interior design is not that great.  There is no inner storage and I have to use a rolled up towel under the neck to really stabilize it.

They are ok but was thinking of welding small piece of steel to front of base to help keep from falling forward. Padding on top ok. Is in two strips on each end about 6 inches apart. Good for speakers deeper than that.  Sometimes is hard to keep speaker from swiveling too easy but not much of an issue. Would recommend these if you get a good price. Probably among most functional actually in taller adjustable affordable stands.. Not some premium gear or anything, most stands aren't.",1

1550,its aight,1
1551,"This is a double-pipe instrument.  It's made entirely out of CANE, which is similar to bamboo but much more fragile if you've never seen cane before.  Cane is a beefy reed grass that grows in swampy areas; it has hollow chambers separated by natural closure points much like bamboo.  But unlike bamboo, cane is very thin and it WILL BREAK if you are not careful.  So BE CAREFUL with it.  This instrument might be good for older kids, but not younger ones or those with ADD/HD who don't know how to take care of their stuff.

Each pipe has three sections.  There is the long piece with the finger holes, the ""mouthpiece"" is in the middle and plugs into the top of the finger-hole section, and the reed is the skinny piece that plugs into the mouthpiece.  Now, this reed is unlike most woodwind instruments you've probably seen before.  The bottom is open and tapered to fit snugly into the mouthpiece.  The top of the reed though, is CLOSED by that natural cell barrier of the cane.  DO NOT cut this; it's supposed to be that way.  (Duh, it comes with instructions.  Try reading those before you go crazy.)  One side of the reed has a section that has been slit.  That is where the air gets in when you blow.  You don't blow through the top like a clarinet or recorder; you blow through the slit in the side of the mouthpiece.  That is why the top of the mouthpiece is closed: it directs all of the air down into the pipe.  In order to do that though, you have to fit the ENTIRE reed (both of them) in your mouth so that your lips close around the mouthpiece.  (Ew, gross... putting this tar-coated string in my mouth.  Yuck.)  The instruction book says you can adjust the width of the slit by prying it up a little bit with ""a piece of string"" or your fingernail if it is too tight, or if it is too wide you can try to clamp it down (not too tight!!!) overnight.  It's easier to open it than to close it, so I don't recommend messing with the slit unless you absolutely need to.  All three pieces are tied together with a piece of string.  The string is coated in TAR because this is a very old-fashioned instrument, and the tar is meant to keep the string from unraveling or rotting.  So don't mess with the string once you get the two reeds swinging freely so they can reach the top of the mouthpiece.

To play, you don't put your fingertips over one hole like a flute or clarinet.  You put your WHOLE FINGER across the two holes that are next to each other on the pipes.  Then you uncover one or both holes to get some interesting sounds.  Both pipes are supposedly tuned to the same note, but it isn't exactly perfect so there is supposed to be a tiny amount of reverb between them.  There is one section in the instructions that says ""until you get good, practice outside away from anyone you still want to keep as a friend.""  So true.  If done right, this thing has a nasal but interesting sound.  If not done perfectly, it's one of the most annoying instruments ever.  Keep that in mind and be nice to your friends and neighbors.  Practice somewhere deep in the woods.  Or maybe on the moon.

I bought this because it was only a few dollars.  If you're paying more than $10 I don't recommend it unless you grew up in the Middle East and are looking for a reminder of home.  The construction is flimsy--it's just cane pipes and tar-coated string, you have to have a gigantic mouth to fit the reeds deep enough to actually play, you have to be able to do ""circular breathing"" to play it right, and the geometry of the air-hole slots on the reeds is really odd.  I don't consider it a waste of money, but it's going to take some real effort to figure out the right way to play this thing.  This particular one is built cheap, more like a toy version of a real instrument.  So the two tubes probably aren't quite in tune (should be the same note on both), you'll have to adjust the mouthpiece air slit, and you'll have to teach yourself how to breathe the right way to get air into the instrument.  You might even have to get a digital tuner and use it to file down the end of the tubes until it's in tune.  Good luck.",1
1552,"This is a good deal, but noisy in comparison to other OD pedals. I ended up getting the Silver Pony kit from BYOC.",1
1553,"Attractive, easy to use, nice sound but NOT nearly as dampened as you would expect/want. The dampened sound is still plenty loud, so this is not for late night practice.",1
1554,"This is my first time trying Elixir strings. Im a huge Martin Life Span strings. These strings did compare to their martin counter parts. But had several advantages and disadvantages that I noticed. A major advantage that I loved about these strings was the smoothness. The strings are slick, and when sliding up and down the frets is almost perfectly silent. Another advantage was the packing, individual packaging per string was nice.

Something I dislike about these strings is that they sound great when played individually and picking. But when strumming the quality of their sound greatly diminishes.

So My final conclusion and the reason for my score is very personal. I love chords and strumming more so than picking, and i find that Martin strings have better tone with strumming than these strings. If I was a huge picker I would stay with these strings. All in all still a good set of strings.

Note: I only have 10 hours of play time on these strings. If they warm up to the guitar I will change my review.",1

Then I discovered that it is difficult to tighten the vertical tube sufficiently because the whole thing turns on itself and theres apparently no way to tighten the bottom part .

The uke sounds decent enough, it stays in tune (Aquila strings), the tuners are nice.  It is lightweight, and I can take it in a boat, in the rain, to the beach, etc and don't have to worry.  It looks cute, more an orange than tomato red, and it is lightweight.

1580,"The U-30 is a decent starter's ukulele, no matter what color you get, but it is not without its flaws. The tuners feel cheap, but they are functional, much better than friction tuners on ""toy"" ukuleles. The body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease, but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers. The string action is low, making it perfect for fast strum patterns. Even for a soprano ukulele, this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain, which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more ""Hawaiian"" sound, but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic, unless using a microphone. The worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings, it takes forever to stretch them or ""break them in."" This means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song, so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner. Chords that use the first fret, such as F and A sound distorted for some reason. Replacing the included strings with Aquila strings makes this ukulele much better, but the added cost puts it in the price range of what I would consider a true starter's ukulele, the Lanikai LU-11. The included gig bag is almost useless, it has absolutely no padding and is very tight. In conclusion, its low price and distinctive high pitch ""Hawaiian"" sound make up for its shortcomings. I would not recommend this as your only ukulele, or even a starter, since the problems with first fret chords will train your ear in a wrong way. I would recommend the U-30 as a backup or ""disposable"" ukulele that you can take anywhere, without fear of damaging or losing it, but for a little more money, you can get better.",1
1581,"The bag itself is ok for the price. My problem is that it's called a ""Jumbo Gig Bag"" maybe I'm an idiot, but I thought it would fit my jumbo size guitar. It does not. It is not long, wide, nor deep enough. Perhaps I should have busted out the tape measure before ordering.",1

Cons:  The plastic is a bit flimsy, flexes way too much on the end of the tray opposite the cup holder.  Transmits a LOT of handling noise up the mic stand, which would be a deal breaker for a lot of pro artists.  I personally don't like the hole in the bottom of the cup holder, prefer any spills or condensation to be captured rather than having it drip onto the stage or carpeting.  Cup holder should be a bit deeper.  The ""O Tray"" is better in regard to all these Cons.",1

1592,"So far it works well.

My concern / complaint is that the mounting holes are not even side to side, so that if you mark and drill your wall in a line to keep the thing level when you install, it will actually be skewed. This is so simple to do in production that the way this is done is almost inexcusable. These guys need to fabricate a simple drill press production jig to insure consistency and quality of their product. This is something that we were taught in Jr. High Wood Shop class. Too bad these guys didn't take the class.

The block is not sanded to a fine grit before finishing, so it has a rough feel / look to it as well. Although the finish is applied thoroughly. The sanding like the drilling could be easily handled by machine and simple jigs. I am not saying dump a ton of money into labor on these as that would ramp the price up a lot. Just design and build some production jigs to do the job right. I would be embarassed to have something like this come out of my wood shop!

The hook itself attaches securely, and is easy to position for various headstock shapes. The metal used is solid, and well machined, not cheap cast junk pieces. Honestly this is where the hanger shines. This is really well done.

There is ample padding to protect my instrument properly.

Overall, it's usable, but the cosmetics and alignments of the wood block will get on your nerves if you have even the slightest hint of a perfectionist streak to you...",1
1593,"I wanted a nice quality guitar strap, and from the pictures, this would fit the bill perfectly. The quality all across the board is fantastic. The issue, however, is that it's not brown like the pictures. A previous review stated it would be a bit darker, and I was ok with that. But it's not even brown. It's pretty much black. I'm very disappointed that the photos are so drastically wrong on color. I checked the tags and they say C-22 as is the item number for this particular strap. It's just inaccurate pictures.",1

1599,"The light weight and battery powered capabilities are this amp's best features.  It can produce pretty good volume for such a small amp, but 6 watts and a 6.5"" speaker can only push so much volume at the lower end.  Lower register notes or chords on an electric guitar can easily overwhelm the amp, producing a rumbling muddy mush of sound.  It has a nice range of effects, but you get far more options from a basic $50 multi-effects pedal.  You can run a mike into it (you'll need a 1/4 jack or adapter), but the vocals won't be a heck of a lot louder than singing out loud without distortion.  Unless the battery powered capability is crucial, I'd pass on this and get a basic 15-20 watt amp and multi-effects pedal for the same price.  You'll get a much better sound.",1
1600,"The quality of the back plate is just as good as more expensive options. I have never purchased a pickguard or back plate that was not beveled, so I was surprised that this one had a straight cut. I went ahead and beveled it myself with a file, but it would have been cleaner if a bevel router bit was used. I peeled off the protective plastic before filing, and then I noticed another layer of plastic. The holes did not line up on my Korean Squier body, nor does it match a MIM backplate. So maybe the holes are for USA Strats. I just drilled new holes in the guitar body.",1
1601,"Honestly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's an EQ. A parametric one, sure, but it's a bit weird because when you turn a certain band all the way down there's still a substantial audible level of it. You really need to combine this with a regular EQ pedal if you want full function, at which point I don't really see the point for live performance, which is the only reason you'd ever need a hardware EQ. For recording, it's much more visually pleasing and practical to use a plugin like Fabfilter, which is incredible BTW.",1
1602,This is a decent sounding pickup and for the price you just cant beat it.,1
1603,ok... they're finger picks!,1
1604,"This is a fine guitar, but it isn't amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.

My remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that ""real"" Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.

The guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a ""full-sized"" guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.",1

1606,"I wanted an inexpensive gig bag for a cheap Mitchell acoustic someone gave me.  I plan to use the Mitchell for a knock-around where I don't want to take my better guitars.

1609,"It's okay.  I need to put a little cloth (I use a little microfiber towel) or the head and neck aren't snug and the bass (Studio 4) shifts around.  Not a huge deal, but obviously this case is for a variety of models and mine is on the small side of the supported range.

The little storage compartments don't seal, so anything small (picks, allen keys, etc) ends up falling to wherever (so, put stuff in a baggie or other container).

Kind of fiddly to get the halves to line up to close properly.  Like, it *seems* closed, but the clasps don't want to line up, so you have to wrestle with it a bit to get the edges to ""mesh"".

The lock is an absolute joke.  I don't think tools would be required to break it.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you could accidentally break it and not even notice.

More important on playing a few notes the air seemed to shake the mp and I could feel the mp vibrate too much,sort of like a piece of paper. Of course I have not played outdoors with this mp which is the intention of the product. A standard goodmp you would not feel the vibrating air stream! I would not reccomend this to anyone.

Not having control over the color/tone of the reverb is the biggest draw back, and eventually I think anyone will feel that limitation.

I have never plugged it into an amp or listened to it through headphones.  Playing from the built-in speaker it sounds a bit much like muzak/elevator music.  The Country Cartidge sounds authentic and the Strangers in the Night cartridge is fitting for this type of sound.  While listeners know the songs and enjoy the Lennon and McCartney cartridge, the sound does not come out anything like The Beatles or any other 'rock' sound.  All of that being said, if you don't have a piano player or guitarist in the house to entertain company, this is a great way for a 'no-talent' like me to do it!  Might also be fun at the local Moose Lodge or at church.  They have a Religious Standards and Religious Favorites cartridge that might be used there.",1

Also, the small semi-circle for the controls did not line up with the guitar control plate.  This required a significant amount of trimming to make it work.

1637,"Fri 9/05/2014. There were at least two things wrong with the launchkey mini:

1. After power-on, it'd work more-or-less (see #2), but if left alone for a half hour or more, when I returned it wouldn't, as tested with the famous free MIDI software MIDIox. Pressing keys, nothing. This was cured by (a.) changing from the hub it was plugged into to a more direct USB connection and, on the provocation of Novation, (b.) plugging into a *different* USB hub. I suspect the number of other devices plugged into the first hub may have been a factor (?), which include an Akai MPK mini, a beautiful Xkey, and even an Arturia Minilab, all of which are comparably-priced small keyboards which seemingly have no comparable problem. Even a Novation launchpad mini didn't quail....

2. Consistently at power-on and after a pause, with whatever USB connection, pressing a key repeatedly shows, as expected, a burst of MIDIox traffic but then nothing for about 10 or twenty keystrokes; and then it resumes. Naturally I noticed this when checking #1.

THE FIX

Novation support has been assiduous in trying to clear this up -- perhaps if you're looking for help, a negative Amazon review'll do the trick -- and after downloading a firmware update (which I probably tried and failed to find before), problem #1 seems cured. Problem #2 still occurred -- but only the *first time* after power on. ... I write ""seems"" only because I don't have a carefully-maintained lab and things change all the time, although both problems occurred quite consistently for weeks, after I first noticed.

It probably *won't ever* fail on your setup -- especially if the launchkey mini you get has the updated firmware already -- and the other ""white knights"" I mentioned above may well set your PC on fire. I don't know. I'm still giving it three stars because it's been entirely too much trouble and if I wasn't a lunatic I would've just left it on the shelf weeks ago. ...

The original phones came with a 1/4"" male plug and a 1/8"" adapter. The new ones came with a 1/8"" plug and a 1/4"" adapter. The first thing I noticed on the new pair was that the stereo separation was very poor. The left and right channels were pretty close to being the same. I tested the old headphones and the separation was noticeably better. But on the new set it is pretty poor, probably about 75% crossover on both ears. If you don't care that much about stereo channel separation, and are willing to peel off the plastic film off the foam ear cans when it starts shredding off, then this is a decent sounding set of earphone for the money.
Discovered a work around for the separation problem. Using the 1/4"" adapter that came with the set, I then use a 1/8"" adapter over the 1/4"" adapter, to bring the jack back to 1/8"". Using the two adapters on the 1/8"" plug seems to restore the stereo separation.",1

I bought this intending on buying a pair of headphones that would be able to provide good amounts of bass without compromising sound quality, but this didn't do that at all. When I 1st listened to them it sounded like the bass was replaced with treble, it was an indescribable experience and was horrible. As I burned it in for an hour it sounded much better in terms of sound quality, but there was very little bass. The overall sound quality was actually less than that of my laptop's speakers believe it or not, which makes these only worth about $60 at most.

However compared side by side, this sounds entirely different from from the Para, this unit is  much tinnier, and it has far less gain using the Radius pickup.  The bass trim does very little for mando.
It does work better on guitar, but still a big difference in tone.

Alone it may be a valuable addition, like most LR Baggs products, it is  very solidly built, and the tone might work fine for your needs, but it is NOT a Para Acoustic DI Junior.

They're sturdy enough to hold your guitar, and I also keep a heavy towel draped over mine, partially to keep off the dust, but also act as padding if it should get knocked over by one of the pets.

It's very easy to assemble, and the strap hook is solid. The base is very solid, and the design allows you to place it back into a corner quite well...something I really like about it. Overall, a very nice guitar stand for the money, but not impressed with the weld on the neck holder.",1
1677,I opened up the microphone to see what kind of element it had and it looked like one of those cheap 10 for $3 condenser mic elements. Doesn't sound too bad just next time I'm going to spend a little more and get a Blue.,1

1680,"The JD-Xi a powerful synth with a great drum machine and awesome sequencer but it has very limited envelope controls on the panel. This would've been fine because one can still modify ADSR in the LCD screen but Roland went with a clunky interface controlled by arrows instead of knobs with features hidden by a ""shift"" button. This slows down workflow and on the fly creativity ESPECIALLY since saving settings takes at least three button presses. Shift+Write, enter, enter. If a sequence happens to be playing then one has to stop that first before saving.

The interface is fine if you're creating/writing at home but given the portability of the JD-Xi, the clunky controls get in the way of spontaneity and the ability to capture the moment anywhere without stopping the groove plus the home user would better served by a full sized synth anyway.",1
1681,"Built nicely, but did not work with my Blackstar HT 100. Sent it back.",1
1682,"I recently purchased a Rondo Music SX JR Jazz short scale bass natural finish left handed. The strings on the bass sounded great but I had to switch the strings around because I re-string right-handed. So I bought these because of the name.
The packaging is very good quality, as are the strings. However, I found the E string to be too fat for my short-scale bass and the lower notes (E through A) were very dull and lifeless. I can't say I get a snappy tone out of the other strings either. I use Hartke Hard Attack 95's for my full scale basses and they sound piano like. I can get that Chris Squire Ric type tone out of my Ibanez bass.

I like strings light-- they seem to be brighter and more ""piano-like"" than thicker strings. Summing up, strings were way too thick for my little travel bass and they were pretty dull and lifeless. My next step is to try the extra light 95's Rotosound 666 Swing Set bass strings by Rotosound.

As we say on Talkbass, your milage may vary. Give them a try if you like thick strings. Obviously well made, just not my cup of tea.",1
1683,"I bought these for my Fender Squire. Unfortunately, I didn't expect that the hole for the Squire is drilled and tapped all the way through the bridge so when I dropped a spring in it just fell all the way into the back of the guitar. I suppose I could put a setscrew in from the back for the spring to rest on, but it's not worth the hassle since I never use the tremelo arm anyway. I'm sure it's a great product, it just didn't work for me and so I'm posting this in case anyone else is thinking of trying these with a Squire.",1
1684,It looks great as for tuning I see a lot of reviews as tuning takes time for New instrument to adapt in strings stretch body stretch takes many tunes especially on wood as I bought this guitar and Luthier I have no problem with mine only wish had better inlays in fretboard but cool paint job and what the neck you want for 40 bucks .tuning takes time I'd buy again for 40 bucks or whatever .actually is purple but looks blue in photo and for my daughter not me but I do play it just needs tweeting and tune time,1

Before you order these check to make sure. They are built well and are an excellent product, For quality they deserve a ""5"", but since I had to open the package to try them out and the shipping to return it would have cost almost as much as the pickup itself it now resides in a parts drawer - I almost rated these a ""2"" because of that.  More than likely they won't work on your guitar - hence a rating of ""3"".",1

1689,"its a pretty simple device so kinda hard to get wrong. The overall quality and strength is fine, i don't worry hanging a $2000 guitar from it. I felt like the bend in the hanger arms could have been designed a bit better. Also it doesn't hold acoustic guitars as far away from the wall as i'd have liked. would have been nice if it came out another inch further from the wall.

Overall for how cheap this is its a good product but i'd rather had an option to spend $10 more and gotten a great product.",1

I ordered two of these and they're both the same way..: very disappointing .",1
1691,"i needed a volume pedal, and the small footprint of this product was appealing. Having a wah built in was an added bonus. I already have a Morely Bad Horsie wah which I love, but being able to have a two for one setup was appealing, since space on a pedal board can be at a premium.
Well I will say that the volume function works well once you set the parameters correctly.
  Can't say the same about the wah function. The sweep of the wah is very shallow, in fact it is so shallow that it is almost like an 'auto wah' pedal as opposed to a full function wah wah pedal. Don't try to play ""Voodoo Chile: Slight Return"" with the wah function..it just doesn't have that deep sweep like my Morely or a Crybaby. Not that it sounds bad, not by any means..it's just that it won't allow you to be as expressive as you might like.
  given the price it's still a great deal...and doesn't seem to add a lot of noise. For the price I would have been happy if it was only a volume pedal, so I really have no complaints. I'll just have to hang on to the Bad Horsie...which isn't a bad thing!",1

1698,"I don't need the built-in microphones for my purposes, but wound up purchasing the Sonic Port VX over the Sonic Port primarily because it will keep my iPad charged while using it with an electric guitar. Disappointing that the original Sonic Port doesn't have that obvious functionality.

I can't speak for the microphones, but otherwise the Sonic Port VX works flawlessly as a guitar input for my iPad and then outputting to both headphones and an external PA, mixing board, or guitar amp (it also outputs to the headphone jack and the 1/4"" outputs simultaneously, though with a single volume control for both). Awesome that the left 1/4"" output sums a stereo signal when used alone into a guitar amplifier - that's a big plus over using Apogee Jam or an iRig Pro. The Sonic Port VX works far better than the iRig 2 I was using before and eliminates a lot of hum and noise present with the iRig 2. When connected, the Sonic Port VX also unlocks the iOS mobile POD app which has now made my old PODxt pretty much obsolete.

Unfortunately, the Sonic Port VX housing is made of plastic, and feels pretty cheap as a result in comparison to my old Line6 PODxt, which has a metal housing and feels far more robust. Not sure why Line6 would decide to make the Sonic Port VX out of plastic when they market it as being a portable recording solution, and thus would be subject to a fair amount of abuse. Loved that my PODxt had a durable metal housing. Feels like this would get damaged pretty easily if you're not careful. The microphone stand it comes with is also made of cheap plastic and probably won't endure much abuse either.  Nice that they do include a 5/8"" to 3/8"" microphone stand adapter so you're covered if you need to mount it to pretty much any microphone stand though.

Very disappointing that Line6 does not include a 30-pin connector for older iOS devices like they do with the regular Sonic Port. So beware: Sonic Port VX only comes with a Lightning cable. Had to track down and separately purchase a 30-pin connector in order to use the Sonic Port VX with my older iPad 2 ( Part #: Line 6 21-34-0230 3-Foot iOS Cable), which works fine except it won't charge older 30-pin devices (minus a second star). What will definitely not work is attempting to use the USB cable supplied with the Sonic Port VX and an Apple USB camera kit with a 30-pin connector.

In sum, it works great, but only three stars for lack of a more durable housing and full backward compatibility support for older iOS devices.",1
1699,It did not fit the hole I hoped.  It is is a drawer waiting for a place to go.,1

1701,"I bought the 76-note version of this bag for my Casio WK-3000 Professional Series 76 Key Digital Recording Studio Styled Keyboard, and it did NOT fit.  After about 5 minutes, I gave up, and returned it.  I later had to settle for this 88-note version, which is obviously bigger than what I need, but at least it'll fit.

Pros:
- Not expensive compared to other cases I've seen (bought mine here for $43.32)
- Extremely light-weight
- Should protect against wind/rain.
- The customer service (my return transaction) from J&R Music and Computer World went pretty smoothly.

Cons:
- Misleading representation of product (i.e., it may NOT fit your keyboard because it is so tightly designed)
- It does not seem to protect against impact/drops.

Overall, I wish I didn't have to buy this bigger version for my keyboard, but at least I have what I need now.  This is definitely an improvement from carrying my keyboard fully exposed.  You don't want your hands to accidentally rip off your keys as you carry it, and you want to have some confidence when carrying it outside with the weather.",1

1711,"First and foremost the included screws are worthless. I strongly urge people not to trust valuable instruments to those things.

The coloration of the wood varies greatly from one to the next, even though you've got the same wood. Now granted this should be expected somewhat because wood grains can vary and that's fine. But just know that you're very unlikely to have them match if you use more than one. If you want matching then choose one of the darker colors where it's the stain that matches up.

The hook part itself isn't bad and I don't have any concerns about it doing any damage to my guitars, but out of 3 different guitars (2 acoustic, 1 electric) two of them end up hanging by the tuning knob on at least one side. Get a measurement of your neck/headstock and compare to this before buying. Otherwise plan on the need to tune your guitar each time you take it off the wall.

Aside from the absolutely worthless screws the overall quality is good, but I'm not pleased with the color variation or the improper fit on what I consider standard sized headstocks.",1
1712,Great deal for the low price IF you get a good one. I've sent back two already and probably won't order this one again. The first send back was due to shipping damage which is understandable occasionally The second send back was due to the bridge snapping right off the soundboard when tuning to concert pitch. No excuse for that!  I also noticed when I returned the 1st guitar for the 2nd one the price had gone up by about $4.  The people selling took my advice though and swapped out the cheap junk they were including with some very useful extras such as foot stand and tuner.  A good starter guitar for a student IF you get a good one.,1
1713,"Good theory, but I thought they'd be wider. I play at a high angle and these still have a tendency to turn a bit and let the strap slip off if the hole is loose.",1
1714,I purchased these strings because the used guitar that I bought from a friend had them on it already. I needed to replace some individual (broken) strings and I was a bit rough on the old strings. I've gotten used to using Gore-Tex type strings which are much more durable. These have a good feel and tone though.,1

1727,"The title pretty much says it. The sound on these is fine. I'm not an audiophile or pretentious enough to try to 'impress' by throwing out terms I've heard others use. I have these hooked up to a digital piano and I like the sound they produce. The problem is volume.
I have seen other speakers used for this purpose and assumed they would have the volume needed to at least fill up a small room (living room) with sound. With the volume at 10 on both keyboard and speakers, these are loud enough for me to hear but if there were any conversation going, these would not have enough power to overcome the background noise. I have tried both direct via 1/4"" mono cables and using the headphone out into the 1/4"" inputs.
I will keep these since they do the bare minimum I was looking for--providing sound for monitoring my practice times. But, if I were looking for something that I could use in a small/intimate performance situation, these would be returned for something with some more power.",1

The chair itself gets the job done, better than a regular dinner table type of chair. The angle of the back rest is perfectly fine for my purposes. Cushions are soft and comfortable. The chair height is slightly adjustable, but it's such a pain to do it that it's unlikely you will want to mess with it too much. Set it to your desired height the first time and you should be good to go. It does not swivel. The chair feels stable. Decent chair for the price, nothing astounding here.",1
1748,"The item description for this is misleading, it is not what I would by any means consider a 'beginner package', so I'm sure many people will be rather disappointed when they open the box and find a ukulele, and a cheap fabric carrying bag.  That's it.  There are no instructions or directions or paperwork of any kind included in the box - it seems like paperwork is missing, there is no information about how to tune or take care of the ukulele. The outside of the box (which is touted as a 'colorful display box', whoopty-doo!) has a picture of a guy who looks like Weird Al Yankovic's older brother and it says 'Digital Download Lesson with Ukulele Bartt'.  If you go to Bartt's website there is indeed a beginner lesson you can download there - if you want to pay for $14.99 to download it.  None of it is free.  So again - I'm confused as to how this is a 'Beginner Package.'
As for the ukulele itself - it's ok as far as ukuleles go, but not as nice as the ones they have at the music store that would cost a little bit more.  My husband is familiar with guitars and how to tune them, and was able to take care of that part by going online - there are free videos and apps you can use to tune it.  And we found some free lessons online (not Bartt) to get us going and after a few hours I was able to strum some chords into a simple song, he was a little further along but knows some chords and notes so that was expected.
If you're just looking for something to tinker and play with - your kid says they want a ukulele and you're not sure how committed they're going to be to learning - then this is a good choice.  If you are committed to really learning and plan to pay for lessons than I would invest in something a little nicer.",1
1749,"TAKE MEASUREMENTS of your guitar before buying. This case is MUCH oversized and seems more appropriate for a jumbo than a dreadnought. I own two dreadnought guitars; neither of them fit snugly.

1750,Great brand. Great stand. But for some reason it didn't exactly fit my Yamaha PSRE253 keyboard. I wish I knew why. Shalom..,1
1751,"THE SKINNY:
 Was encouraged by the size, the weight, the simplicity, and the cost. While the controller is just *fine* for a beginner, its quality matches its price:
1. keys are very decent for the price EXCEPT after 4 months of light use (3x week) 4 of the keys now squeak (like a small squeaky spring) EVERY time they're depressed. WD40 did nothing to resolve this (last-ditch effort after trying endless to solve the issue).
2. pads (rarely, if ever, used) feel fine, if not a little too stiff.
3. additional buttons/encoders feel just fine.

FEATURES/SOFTWARE: basically non-existent. The only thing that comes ready-to-use is the OCTAVE DOWN/UP buttons. Aside from that, better be comfortable assigning MIDI controls with your DAW software. Comes with standalone software I found to be repulsive, tedious, and rarely working. You have to essentially make changes to parameters (say pitch or velocity) on the ALESIS software on your computer and then ""send"" it to the controller, doesn't happen real time as you're changing it.

BACKGROUND/PERSPECTIVE:
I'm using this with Logic Pro X and using it almost exclusively as a controller to play/control plugin synths and samplers. I've found that, in the end, I rarely use a controller's as a shortcut to manipulate settings and parameters in Logic Pro X as, in the end, it was far less time-consuming, frustrating, and efficient to simply use my mouse.

I've purchased/returned/sold approximately 6 MIDI controllers in the past 4 years. Unfortunately, it's extremely difficult to find exactly what I'm looking for as the mid-range controllers ($300-500) tend to oversaturate the thing with pads, sliders, encoders, and screens -- all of which cost money to build/design, essentially taking value away from the quality of the actual keyboard (translation: a $300 controller with loads of features and snazzy lights and screens will typically have a similar quality of key-build as a bare-bones controller for $125).

Therefore, I'm simply looking for a mid-range ""basic"" controller with QUALITY keys, software (if necessary), touch response (velocity accuracy and sensitivity), and a few BASIC knobs/encoders/sliders.

CONCLUSION:
Poor man pays twice. If you're at all particular and care enough about buying reasonable quality (enough to read this entire review) then you're probably like me: this won't suffice. Don't hassle yourself, spend a little more money. Next order for me will be the Roland A-500 or A-600.",1
1752,"-------- What you use this software for --------

1) Remove vocals to convert songs for Karaoke (you can also change pitch).
2) Isolate instruments for music students to learn from (tempo control can slow it down so you can hear every note).
3) Apply limited audio effects (like echo or reverb)
4) Remove an instrument, instruments or vocals from songs so that you can add new ones in another software program (like Audacity).

--------  Installing the software --------

My system: Win7 64-bit, 16GB RAM, i7-920 processor

Installing this software was a mess. Not only did the installer take close to thirty minutes to complete, but it didn't give me an option to select which drive I wanted to install the program on. Because I run my OS on a SSD, I don't want to install third party programs that will use up space. I have a separate HD for that, but this software forcefully installs on the same drive as the OS (sorry, but that's just bad programming).

-------- Importing music files --------

When I opened the program and went to import music, I realized that MP3s aren't compatible. Nor is FLAC. In fact, the only file type you can open is WAV (44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, 16-bit, stereo or monaural) or AIFF (44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, 16-bit, stereo or monaural) (Mac OS version only).

Alright, I get that. I get that the file needs to be uncompressed in order to detect the full sound spectrum. But, what I don't get is why Roland didn't provide their own conversion tools. You'd think for the price of this software that would be a given. Unfortunately, it isn't. So, if you want to work with MP3s or other file types, you'll need to use other software to save them as WAV or AIFF. Thankfully, there are many free options out there that can do this, such as iTunes. But remember you can't export into MP3 either, so you'll need to convert it back with the other software too.

-------- Isolating sounds --------

I found that the software did a pretty good job of isolating sounds. The controls are easy to use and lets you listen to changes on the fly. There are times you can't isolate things, for example a guitar and a piano might show up together. If so, they cannot be separated. And there are times the isolated sounds(s) are there in the background, but just faded.

Overall, this software works fairly well at doing what it is designed to do. But for the cost, I think there are one too many flaws.",1
1753,"I would say the coolest feature of this mic would probably be that you can switch from a cardiod, to an omnidirectional pattern, then I suppose to a ""figure eight"" pattern. Admittedly I haven't used all three of these functions, just the cardiod and the omnidirection pattern. I suppose some people will like this mic. At times I like the sound quality from it, but mostly the audio I get from it is really kind of bland and unpleasant. I've tried to use it for voclas in a hip hop song- not a good idea. The vocals aren't very clear at all imo. I did get it used from a guy on craigslist, but it seems to work ok regardless. I just personally don't like the sound or the ""flavor"" you get with this mic. It's too chromatic and hollow sounding. Not even up front or warm like say the MXL V67G which I owned briefly. Although I really don't like that mic at all. I would say if you're choosing between this and the MXL V67G get this one for sure. But I'd probably recommend a Shure sm58 over this any day even though I've never owned one yet. At first you will want something that ""sounds"" professional but as you go on with audio work and vocals you will want something more ""clear"" and up front. Not something chromatic, muddy, or flangy. The MXL is more hot and up front, but it's also really muddy. This mic isn't as up front, but it's really flangy and kind of hollow sounding. Both cases are examples of mics you probably don't want to own as you progress with vocal work. I am still searching and finding better microphones and price range doesn't necessarily mean a great mic although as a general rule probably the more you spend the better the mic will be.

So far the best mic's I've owned are the MXL 2001 (deosn't do too well with high's though, better for people with a softer voice like myself, btw you absolutely need a pop filter with this mic, whereas you dont' really need one with the Behringer B2 Pro, which is one of it's good points). The Blue Bluebird (great all around mic for vocals, although the vocals tend to come across as somewhat soft. But this mic is a great all around mic for different applications. Professional sounding for singers and rappers on songs, and also great for podcasting although you WILL need a pop filter for this mic). And that's about it for good mics I could recommend. As I said I'm still searching myself for a good all around mic. The Behringer B2 pro is OK if you find a good deal on it. I would NOT pay $150 for it though. Imho it's worth about $70, which is about what I paid for it used.

Pros:

-Don't need a pop filter
-Passable mic for podcasting or voice overs
-Has different functions for different purposes
-Probably a pretty good mic for recording multiple people on one podcast (although I haven't tried it yet)
-Probably a pretty decent mic for starting out podcasting if you can get a good deal on it, maybe

Cons:

-Not a good mic for song vocals
-Flat, chromatic, hollow sounding
-Just don't like the ""flavor"" of how this mic sounds, some might though
-Doesn't' seem to sound ""professional"" to me, rather how a cheap version of a pro mic would sound",1

1763,"These always seem like a good idea because they're low-profile, but they lean your guitar too far back, and if your guitar has an irregularly shaped body(in my case a Fender Jagmaster) then you have to lean it all weird.  Probably better for acoustics than electrics. I may have to resort to the standard neck/body-holding stand.  I can see how others may like it, its just not my jam.",1
1764,"I bought this to use in my garage/shop. I've also used it by the front door as a place to put my shoes on. I don't use this stool for guitar practice. I actually use a Gibraltar adjustable drummer's throne for that since the Gibraltar is MUCH nicer than this stool.
There are some pros and cons to this stool.
Pros:
Fender logo
Vintage looking sparkly bright red side wall.
Vintage looking metal frame
Comfortable height (24"" model)
Swivel seat

Cons:
Metal frame rails are uncomfortable on bare feet.
Cushion side wall (red banded part) is hard (seems to be plywood) and is uncomfortable on the back on your legs
Cushion is covered in vinyl and will stick to the bare skin of your legs.
Expensive for the type of stool it is (you're paying for the Fender logo)

Overall, I'm pleased with the stool and it's fine for short periods of sitting. I don't think it's comfortable enough for focused guitar practice. Decent shop stool.",1
1765,"It is not what I was looking for. Although, it is a very good product. If you change frequently your strings it is a great deal.",1
1766,"I am a 20-year musician and my 7 yr old daughter recently (before Christmas) stated she wanted to start learning to play guitar.  I purchased this thinking it would be a good starter guitar, not wanting to shell out bunches of money for something that may or may not stick with her.  While the build of the guitar seems solid enough, I cannot keep the top two E and B strings in tune.  This is a nylon stringed guitar and I understand the process of new strings stretching out, but those 2 strings will not stay tuned.  On top of that, I actually have the guitar tuned down 2 full steps b/c I fear the tension would cause harm to the next and top.  I did not expect a lot for a guitar at this price point, but it is impossible to teach on a guitar that will not stay tuned.",1
1767,"I've been using the snark for a year or so now, and I always have the suspicion that it's just telling me what I want to hear - that my guitar is in tune, when in fact, it's not.  The other day I had to go from standard tuning to DADGAD, and had about 1 minute to do so (plenty of time) but after the tuner said it was in tune, it was time to start playing and it was, well... noticeably out of tune.  After checking each string multiple times!  Very frustrating.  I guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy.  If you want something that usually puts you in the ballpark but may betray you when it really counts, then go with the Snark.  It's better than other clip-ons I've used, but still not cutting it in my opinion.  I play a Taylor 414ce.  A plus side is that you can buy a five-pack of batteries on amazon for 2 bucks - shipping and all.  You will need them sooner than you think :)",1

1771,"The tuners seem to be a good value for the price.  However, you would be best to replace the screws.  The screws are not heat treated.  I had 1/3 of them break during installation.  The head snaps off or the philip head breaks out.",1
1772,Are just fine..',1
1773,These are not the same size as the knobs which came with the bass so plan on replacing both or more if you have them.  They work but seems they cuts some corners and you are not going to be able to keep one as an extra.  They work but hard to be super positive about them.  MAYBE.,1
1774,"As most probably have experienced, these work great, staying accurate and helping you tune no matter the audio conditions around you...until the arm holding it to the clamp snaps! It's great to have range to move the head of the Snark around so you can see it no matter where you attach it, but that joint is the Achilles' Heel for the Snark. I've broken two, and have since moved to other tuners that function the same way, but do not feature a snapping arm!",1
1775,"You don't get what you pay for. Buy the other amp it has a larger speaker and form factor. This thing is tiny and tiny and full sound are generally counter unless your owning a Bose like acoustic system.

If you use headphones you will likely be more than pleased. It's only when played acoustically that you ""might"" be unhappy. For 50 dollars it's not, IMO, worth it, unless you are really looking for that form factor an willing to compromise on sound.",1
1776,"While the unit is adjustable for variety of instruments, has a nice carrying bag, folds small, the neck restraint strap comes off too easily to keep the instrument from being accidentally knocked off the stand. FYI, the cradle for the neck is 1 and 15/16 inches (4.9cm) wide at the mouth and narrows pretty quickly. In case you're thinking of putting a bigger instrument in there.",1
1777,"Expected poly strap with leather ends, like I ordered before, but these are poly strap and poly ends. Seems cheap, and don't expect it to last as long as the leather ended version of this same strap.",1
1778,Lasted a month,1
1779,"Most better quality leather guitar straps are typically $20 or more, so in retrospect, the low cost of this Planet Waves Black Leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag.  I bought it anyway, hoping that it would be a decent product, but unfortunately, upon receiving it, I was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the item.

While the strap appears to be 100% leather, and isn't a piece of junk, it doesn't appear to be of very high quality. The leather is thin and soft, and I would not be at all surprised, if the edges soon begin to curl, and the strap begins to wrinkle. I don't expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts, to hold up well long term. If you use this strap, you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system.

I have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years. The leather is thicker and stiffer, and has resisted fraying along the edges. While the leather has developed some cracks, it is still holding up fine, and there is no chance that the strap will tear. I could be wrong, but looking at the Planet Waves strap, I have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long.

If you are a casual player, this strap is probably fine, although strap locks are recommended. The leather may start to curl up and deform, but the strap certainly isn't going to fail immediately. While serviceable, more serious players, or those with an aggressive style of playing, might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap. I decided to keep this strap, but it is installed on a secondary guitar that I don't play that much.",1

After mounting the thing and getting everything set up, I noticed this and had to pull it and tighten them down. One is completely missing. The other side was tight. There are no washers, though, so I don't know if they will stay tight over time. I'm happy with the build quality, otherwise.",1

I did a search and found that there are mods I can do to the circuit board to regain my old sound, but they do require some soldering skills. In short, I think the product quality is fine, just don't expect it to sound or work like an original Crybaby. It's mainly a matter of taste and what you are used to hearing, so some people may like this sound as well or better.",1
1796,"I bought this for carrying the ever-increasing collection of chords I've accumulated as I've done live sound and music productions over the past five years.  The concept of the bag is great -- dividers for cords so you can store them upright, for example.  The material is thick and tough, and there are lots of pockets for odd-sized items.

The part I didn't like about this was that it's hard to transport it.  I have to wheel my equipment on dollies to the performance area for the jobs I do, and have found it's better just to use a plastic bin.  Inside the bin, put your properly coiled cords in other smaller bins for different sized items, and store extension and instrument/microphone cables on a caddy that allows easy roll-up, such as this https://www.amazon.com/Bayco-KW-130-Storage-Center-150-Feet/dp/B0000BYBVT/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1482661903&sr=8-6&keywords=extension+cord+reel

Take it all and put it in a bin like this:

You can put other things on top of it without them falling over as you wheel all your stuff to the performance area.

But the people at Phitz were very gracious for my return, and even sent me a shipping label, the cost of which they will deduct from my refund.  They made it easy, were responsive, and gracious about the return.  I would buy from them again given the quality of their product and the ease of returns, if necessary, should I ever need any of their products in the future.

1808,"The capo is a wonderful tool for the guitar.  When new innovations are made, they are generally priced higher than their older counterparts.  The ability to exert the desired amount of pressure that you want from a capo was very intriguing to me.  For chording and the ability to move the capo quickly, I give it high marks.  If you bend a note and you don't have the capo tightened down enough, the string will stay bent.  That is a definite minus.  I think it's a great invention.  I just think it costs way too much.  There are other capos that do essentially the same thing now for 1/3rd the price.  Try some less expensive one's.  You'll save a lot of money.",1
1809,"Ok, this pedal SOUNDS great!  True bypass, built like a tan, harmonizing or whammy(up or down)...its great.  It SOUNDS great, looks great but...maybe its me, but I hate the ergonomics. The pedal is like a wah, in that it can be set in any position and left there.  On a wah, thats great, you can use it as a sort of booster.  But for whammy, its kind of annoying.  I would prefer it to return to zero.  You know, like a real whammy bar.  Also, the pedal itself isn't comfortable to play for extended lengths of time.  Its a cool pedal that sounds great, it just needs a redesign.",1
1810,"A while back I had bought this pick, and it was wonderful for a short time. I thoroughly enjoyed playing guitar, and was even better at some things because of the different variations of holding this particular pick. The only complaint I have about this pick is the fact that it wears out rather quickly. For the price, you'd expect it to last longer. Within a week of playing, for about 1-2 hours per day, I barely had any pick left. I buy 12 packs of regular picks for around the same price as this single one and each pick lasts me about a month (provided I don't drop it or misplace it). I did really like this pick, though. I loved the fact that no matter what I played, I never once dropped it during a song.",1
1811,Cool product but I don't expect the strap to last too long because it's elastic... Pounding your foot on the ground is gonna break that thing eventually...

1. I discovered that the designers were, apparently, not musically inclined as they didn't realize that there exists a 3/4 waltz beat. No one waltzes anymore you say? Tell that to Norwegian Wood. This shot the first star off.
2. Tried like crazy to figure out a way to use the second foot switch to add a fill whenever I wanted one. Couldn't come up with the solution so I emailed tech support at Korg. Guess who never responded - not even with the old ""We've received your email and will respond soon"" auto reply. Zing! Another star shot off.

1825,"I sold off my PMD 620 when the 661 came out.  The 661 has a plethora of new features, dual VU meters (one on the OLED display and one on an LED bargraph display which can be turned off to save battery).  \\

The big plus for the 661 is that it can record from MIC or LINE differential (XLR) inputs while most ""handheld"" recorders offer only mic recording, thus introducing noise from the internal mic amplifiers and dc/dc converter needed if using +48vdc phantom power to run the mic.  Line has none of that and hence a substantially better s/n ratio.

Since the 661's introduction at about 600 street, the price has dropped about 100 making it an optimal competitor with digital inputs, line (3.5mm TRS) inputs, line (XLR balanced) inputs, and mic (xlr balanced with 48vdc phantom if needed) inputs.  That's 4 input sources from a handheld unit, but sadly only 2 channels.

I did buy the zoom h4n but found that to get true 4 channel recording you had to go into the unit at mic level which introduced alot of noise on all 4 channels - I prefer the line inputs on the marantz due to the better s/n ratio.  If money were no object I'd buy 2 marantz units and sync their clocks, then use cubase to precisely get the 4 channels in sync (or adobe soundbooth).

Today the PMD 620 is the blow-out product.  Before buying look at the 660 (also blow-out) and the new 661 as record decks.  While the zoom offers some great features, it does so by questionable techniques, such as using a 0-100% attenuator to offer so called ""line in"" while leaving the mic preamps turned on.  That is not true line = in, but a workaround to attenuate line level signals to mic signals them re-amplify them to line level inside the recorder, which is why it has such a high self-noise level.  I do like the quad recording mode on the z4n

Regardless of which recorder you choose, using the sanyo 2700 mAh batteries charged the night before use will give you longer runtimes than AA alkaline, approaching the runtimes of lithium batteries.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanyo-2-700-mAh-AA-NiMH-Rechargeable-Batteries-4-Pack/dp/B000IV413S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanyo 2,700 mAh AA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)</a>",1

I later noticed I had a ""low battery"" reading ( I guess I missed it due to the dim readout).  After replacing the battery, the readout was easier to see, and the sensitivity of the tuner improved.

1836,"This isn't a good beginner guitar unless you know how to work on guitars or you are willing to put, at least, $150 - $200 into having a luthier perform a good setup, nut and bridge replacement and fret leveling.  The body, neck and head-stock are all pretty solid, the top appears to be made of spruce and it sounds like spruce.  The braces inside the guitar are a little thick and stiffer than they need to be for a 3/4 size guitar which can dampen the tone a little but after the mods and work it sounds better than anything in the $300-$500 price range that I've heard.  The neck came completely de-compensated, I had to string it to pitch and adjust the truss rod out of the box.  Once the truss rod was adjusted, to proper string relief, I noticed the nut wasn't cut properly - I have really strong hands and I had a hard time fretting any of the strings at the first fret because the nuts were cut too shallow, the strings were a mile above the frets.  There were two high frets at 12 and 15 - the first two strings (high E and B) completely bottomed out on these high frets - so I had to level and re-crown all of the frets that are over the body.  All of the frets had REALLY sharp ends so I had to file and polish all of the fret ends so that they wouldn't cut my daughters fingers - they were that sharp.  I replaced the stock plastic nut and bridge with bone ($5.00) and the stock plastic bridge pins with ebony ($5.00).  The tuning keys are nothing to write home about but they work, seem pretty smooth and fairly solid - it stays in tune.  I replaced the stock strings with Elixer light strings so that my daughter would have an easier time fretting notes and fewer blisters.  After all of the replacements and added work this guitar sounds like a $400-$500 guitar but it took a lot of work to get it there.  Don't expect this guitar to play well out of the box, it's a good project guitar and looks decent but it's not a good guitar for a beginning student, definitely not for a child - this guitar might make them quit guitar before they've even started.  Children need a guitar with light strings, low action, no barbs and level frets, this guitar doesn't have those things.  The case is not padded, the tuner is of questionable quality, the strap is a standard, cheap, acoustic strap, strings are like brass twine.  For an economical and high quality replacement I suggest buying the Blisstime 6 string acoustic guitar bone bridge saddle and nut and Blisstime ebony bridge pins.  These three items will improve sound and playability 100%, over stock, even if you don't cut the nut to proper height - just pop them on, tune up and play",1

1847,"The Cordoba 15CM is a notable competitor in the crowded sub $100 concert ukulele segment. The most impressive feature is the sustain, even for a concert, you would not expect a ukulele of this price and size to have this much sustain, perfect for hammer-on. It's excellent sustain is comparable to what you would find on Martins and Fenders that cost two to three times as much. This sustain feature does come at a hefty price, the wood used for the construction of this ukulele is paper thin, making the instrument very light, but also very delicate and easily cracked. The light construction of this ukulele will make it a problem for players that live in places with much variation in humidity and temperature, things that can crack your ukulele easily. The strings are set low, making it great for fast strum patterns. The biggest problem I can find with this ukulele is this annoying ""thump"" you hear every time you strum. The thumping is a consequence of the light construction. To prevent the thumping sound, you have to strum very lightly, which of course will cause your volume to be low, and will also affect your sustain. The thumping is the Achilles heel of this ukulele, I have tested several 15CM and they all have this problem, so it is part of the design. More expensive Cordoba concert ukuleles do not have this thumping anomaly. This is a popular ukulele, so this means that players of the 15cm have learned to use the ""thumping""  as part of their performance, or have learned to minimize or avoid it. Competitors from Lanikai and Martin do not have this thumping and offer a comparable sound. Like Lanikais and Martins of this price segment, this ukulele is made in China, not Portugal or Mexico.",1
1848,The Boss CEB-3 Bass chorus sound is too light for me so I may end up looking for something else.,1
1849,"The height is perfect for the low action I wanted on my cheapy violin. The self-adjusting feet did their job and it feels stable. However, the string edge was twice as thick as it should be, no bevel. And the string grooves were only lightly marked with tiny notches, not actually cut in. Not only that, but the distances of the notches were incorrect. The spacing was a full millimeter too wide between each. It seems like this was half-finished and somehow made it past quality control. Instead of sending it back, I finished the bridge myself and corrected the groove spacing.

Not everyone is capable or has the motivation to finish and fit a bridge on their own. I gave it three stars because it had the action I wanted without a lot of expense, but if I couldn't fix the other problems myself I'd have given it 1 star. Maybe my suspicion is correct and I just got a mistake that made it past quality control. I doubt it would have so many great reviews if they were all like mine.",1
1850,"I had to spend another $40 to buy a separate phantom power supply for my microphone, because I learned after purchasing the Behringer that the preamp in the mixer supplies about 1/4 the voltage needed to fully power a condenser microphone.  At first I thought the mixer was faulty, but a quick check of message boards and the schematics of the unit itself revealed the low phantom power output. Other than that, it's great-I just wished Behringer wouldn't advertise it as having phantom power-because it doesn't work (my microphone ""power"" light barely lit up and the mic had to be cranked up to the Max setting to even register-and when you did it was full of white noise with little microphone signal).",1
1851,I have this attached to an On Stage KS7150 stand that is supposed to be compatible. I've been playing around with this for a few days and I just can't get both sides even no matter what I try. The rear entry slots on the KS7150 are not positioned as wide as most keyboard stands so the stabilizer bar that's included can't be used. It should still line up even regardless of me not using the stabilizer bar. So I have to rate this 3 out 5 stars for that because it's very annoying that my top midi keyboard has this weird lean to it. I'll be looking to see if there are some alternative options.,1
1852,Got it to boost a Les Paul through a Marshall DSL40. In my experience it was too muddy with my setup. It does work very well but i wouldn't advise using with a Les Paul or any guitar with tons of low midrange. If you want warm overdrive then this is a good pedal to get.,1
1853,The recipient of this gift indicated that it was functional and worked well enough to justify purchasing a second one to use in another location.,1
1854,"These are the Kongin KM-208, that Neewer is selling, and there are various reviews on YouTube. I didn't expect much for the price, but I am somewhat surprised.

First of all, I wanted more than one mic. Other sellers wanted a lot more money for a pair of two mics on two different (or multiple) channels, etc., and ALL of these cheaper lavaliere mics have mixed reviews. But these Kongin KM-208 were so cheap that I risked it and bought a pair of them. The good news for me is that, as you may have read in other reviews, these are made to work on either of two different channels (noted by red or green LEDs - on both the transmitter and receiver). Someone at the seller's business took the time to figure that I needed the two different channels so they wouldn't interfere with each other, and sent me the two different models without my asking for it/them. BIG plus for the seller's reputation! As to the issue about the 1/4"" plug on the receivers: I have a Zoom H4n recorder which has these jacks built into the unit (where the XLR inputs are), so no need for 1/8"" (3.5mm) adapters. These fit and work perfectly with my camera rig. (See pic)

Common to what others have said (and made YouTube videos about) these are not very good quality. But that can be overcome pretty easily. The transmitters have a native *hiss* to them - that is, with the microphones unplugged from the transmitters and the receivers switched on and plugged into the recorder, there is an unfortunate hiss you hear very clearly (which goes away when the transmitter is switched off). Some of that hiss can be overcome using a simple program like Audacity (free) to mask it. If not for the hiss these would sound pretty damn good. But filtering that hiss completely leaves the audio track sounding like it's in a tin can.

Bottom line is although these are not high-quality, they are worth the $13.26 (Amazon Prime) cost. So $27 for TWO wireless lavalier microphones, shipped and including tax it's better to keep them around for non-professional use than to return them.",1

On the other hand, if you are buying a new stand, the bag comes with it...",1
1858,No difference in sound quality but I guess it serves a purpose if you want the mic closer to our mouth while videoing or something.,1
1859,good,1
1860,I purchased these because I was expecting there style (T3) to work better than a traditional pick. It does not make any difference to me and my playing style. I'm a strummer in a rock/country band and what's more important to me is that the pick does not slip out of my hand during a performance. These are a bit slippery for me. I drop them more that I would like.,1
1861,This is the large? I can't see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all. The lines for the strings and frets are very close together.,1
1862,"Very simple sounding fuzz.
Was enticed by some online demos that sounded really good.
In practice...just so-so really, and not awfully versatile, kinda thin sounding.
I enjoy many more fuzz pedals more, hence the only 3 star rating.",1
1863,"Not bad, could be better.",1
1864,"Decent stuff, comparable to fast-fret, not quite what I wanted though. I was hoping for a cleaner without the lubricant. Lube will protect your strings from corrosion if the instrument sits without being played for a while, the trade off is that it dulls the tone.",1

1868,"The base is adequately heavy, and the tripod legs are rock solid.  The center clutch cannot be tightened down enough to prevent the upper shaft from rotating.  The boom hinge (the part that sets the angle of the boom) never quite locks the boom at the desired angle.  It wobbles a bit, and lets to boom drift if you don't crank the knob down enough to seem too much.  The boom is strong enough, but thin.  The part you slide it back and forth through to adjust it's length is a little loose.  The knobs that tighten down the boom do not feel like they hold the boom firmly enough to keep it from sliding or rotating.

In short, the stand mostly works, but never gives me a feeling of confidence that I can count on it.  (Except the base.  The base is rock solid.)  So how do you rate this?  4 stars because it works pretty well at a decent price?  Or three stars because I can't trust it?  I'll go with three stars.",1
1869,It works... I just have to figure out how to use it and where to place it on my effect chain.,1

1872,"It creates some reverb. There isn't much distinct sound variation between the various settings and the sound overall is grainy quality. If you're working with logic or live you probably will find your software reverbs infinitely more useful and this unity isn't of sufficient quality to give you the warmth of analog. It's a fine toy, worth the price. Don't mistake it for high-quality or versatile gear.",1
1873,"I installed this on my Epiphone Les Paul Special. This did improve my guitar's tone and sustain, but it caused the G string to sound muffled.

I'm just using it on a partscaster spare, so I don't care all that much, but it's probably half the weight it should be.",1
1876,Is good but cannot be combined with other units.  Totally separate parts.  On Stage website shows that the replacement parts are the same and that is not true.,1
1877,"If you're not too fussy and you want to file a bit on your frets, this will do the job for not much money.  The stone is too course to use for ""fret cleaning"".  I ended up spending a lot more to get a good three sided fret crowning file and a fret end dressing file, as well as a separate fret cleaning kit, even though I'm not a luthier and expect to only do a very little bit of fret work and maintenance.

The first job for the blue abrasive stone in this kit was cleaning up the sharp edges on the two thin stainless fretboard protectors in this kit before I'd let them anywhere near a fretboard.  I'd usually prefer to use blue painter's tape to mask off the fretboard when working on the frets, but the tape wouldn't provide enough protection against the coarse stone in this kit.  I'd use blue tape to hold the stainless fretboard protectors in place, because if they slipped off, a single pass of that coarse stone would dig a gouge in a fretboard.  Be careful!  Go slow and use a very light pressure.  You'll need some 320, 600, and 1500 wet/dry sandpaper at the very least to clean up the frets after using this coarse stone.  Or use medium, fine and superfine ScotchBrite with the fretboard protectors in place.",1
1878,"The feel of these strings is good, but the only problem I have is the sound just is not something I like. I wanted to give these a shot because of the price and the feedback I was reading. I would have to agree with other users on this. The sound is sub par at best.",1
1879,"Pretty decent small boom and very suitable for voiceover work or a small project studio. I use this for voiceovers as well as for guests in a small production studio and it works well enough for that.

1902,"It's inexpensive. The overall fit and finish are okay-to-great. Attaching a boom arm and a Shure-type SM58 Mic puts the stand into the ""tippy"" mode. For light-weight direct Mic attachment and as a specific-use or ""starter"" Mic stand it's okay-to-fine depending upon your expectations. I've added a 6# base counterweight accessory item which seems to solve the boom-tippy situation.  At the end of the day, for the price paid and with REASONABLE expectations ... it's FINE!

Bought this stand as a test to replace some tripod stands.  The tripods take up a lot of floor space and present ""navigational"" (tripping) issues both in the Garage Band (actual physical band, not the software/game variety) and Stage set up modes.

1934,"I received this lighting rig today, which is amazing given that I just ordered it a couple days ago. It came sturdily shipped, however the word CHINA was brightly emboldened on the outer box; my first clue that there may be set-up issues. I wasn't wrong. The stand came in a box with loose fittings (screws, etc.), and the lighting cans and 'brain' in separate boxes.

Everything looked well enough, however there are no real instructions that come with this. I'm surprised that I'm the first one to make light of this, at least of the many positive reviews that I read before purchase. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, however it's always nice to get a hands on 'screw this here first, then add this on after', etc. Don't rely on the pictures on the box! According to the pictures, you hang the cans with the label showing on top (I think even in the ad it shows that). That's wrong, if you do that your gels fall on the floor. The labels go face down.

Also included is an 'allen' wrench, for which there is no discernible purpose! I couldn't find one thing on this set-up that has need of an allen wrench. ???

The lights themselves seem to work well. The gels didn't fit that well into the sleeves for the cans, but that's tolerable. I promise to add a star or even two, to my review, once I take these out to a gig and see how they perform. But the lack of any substantive, illustrative instruction can only allow for 3 stars at this point. Even some suggestions as to how to get various results from different settings on the 'brain' would have been nice, you're just left to experiment in non-performance environs.",1
1935,Disappointing so far I have it being run by the QSC GX5 amp using their built in crossover and it just does not thumb loud enough for me! Maybe I can make it sound better after connecting a good EQ to it!,1
1936,"I love the microphone, but the cord is crap. Wheres the tip? The tip of the jack broke off INSIDE my practice amp. Now, Im getting the cord refunded and replaced, BUT my amp STILL has the tip of the jack broken off in the jack port. How is a replacement of the cord equal and fair? Its not. I wouldnt even know who to contact about it. Disappointed.

Also, the mic doesnt articulate as much as it looks like in the photos, but my main concern is the cheap cord and an amp I need to take somewhere to get fixed now.",1
1937,"This is a relatively cheap and easy way to plug in. All you need is an electric guitar, some headphones, and this. No amp, no cables required. The sound quality is low, but it's not a bad thing. The low-fi sound can be utilized. I use the pocket amplifier with a bass. With nice headphones it sounds as good as my practice amp. I can walk around the house playing electric bass freely. No wires.

And surprisingly, it came with a set of batteries.",1
1938,"I give it a three for the price. It use it so my drummer can at least hear what is going on, and it works good for that purpose.
Yes there are better units out there that can cost up to $1000 but this gets the job done.
It distorts easy and I've found that the best way to  fix that is to turn the output on the mixer way down and use the Takstar's volume to get the volume up. To much volume coming out of the mixer will clip this thing very badly.",1
1939,"I've been searching for a pick that I won't drop when my hand gets sweaty. For a few years now I've been using Snarling Dogs picks because the grip on them is so excellent. The downside for me was the material they are made of.  Too plastic feeling and sounding. These Clayton picks are the right material. They sound and feel much better. The grip material on the pick isn't as good as what's on the Snarling Dog picks, but it does a decent job and the tone is so much better I can adjust.  These Sand Shark Picks are also reasonably priced.",1
1940,"Good sound for recording and playback, perfect with iPad and MacBook, my only concern is regarding Midi, I have a very big latency problem, I was unable to use it as a midi interface.",1
1941,Works great just wish they made it a little longer. 2 feet barely makes it to the output jack,1
1942,"Tried this unit today and I am a little disappointed in the volume. I am playing a set of electronic drums through this system utilizing Behringer 12"" PA boxes. The sound is OK but lacks a bit of bottom end clarity. Also, the stated output of 250 watts into 8 ohms would be music power at the most. I think probably around 100 watts RMS per side. For the money though, it's a bargain.

1943,"First let me start with the good. The amp is built like a champ. Very solid construction and looks really, really nice! The knobs all have a nice smooth taper and the jacks all seem to be of good quality. The battery life in this amp is really great and if you are plugging into the amp and using headphones it does have a good sound. I have throw this in with my pedalboard for trips so I can use all my pedals into and amp, and it works with headphones. The sound of the amp by itself is, well sad really. Not sure what all the other reviews were going on about but this amp sounds like a set of crappy pc speakers un am amp, which is what this is. The tone knob only takes the tone from muddy to tinny. The gain is very toyish sounding but you can get a nice overdrive out of it. The volume is way loud if using gain, but clean sounds are hard to get if using hum-buckers. Overall it looks awesome on the shelf, sounds good with pedals or without into headphones, its light weight, and its a pretty cool little amp if you ask me. Just be honest with yourself and know that you are buying a 1w guitar amp with 2 cheap computer speakers inside and that it will sound like cheap 1w computer speakers and you'll be all right.",1
1944,"I will start by saying that this item was returned to seller. I bought this to see if it would suffice in quality to put on a custom zebrawood deep hollowbody guitar that I picked up on the cheap. The unit arrived fine and seems as though it will function fine. The issue is with the finish and the fact that the spring was set into the bottom of the bridge with epoxy. One could rectify the glue issue with some work I'd imagine but the current glue job looks like crap.

The main issue is that there is a chrome bubble in the lower bridge area and two sharp nicks taken out of the handle, as if something sharp was whacked into it several times. This left two sharp spots in the leading edge of the handle.

As I said, this will function fine from the looks of it but if your worried about anything close to perfection in finish, you may want to keep looking.",1
1945,"I bought this humidfier for an newly purchased Acoustic guitar with the idea the it was going to fit some how between the strings without being so big it would pull the guitar out of tune.  Good grief, it doesnt even fit between the strings. Maybe Im missing something here but this is almost impossiable.  I ended up hanging it between the sixth string and the soundhole.  Am going to drill holes in the plastic top piece that lays on top of the strings and put a small wire hook on it so it hangs under neath the strings like the original picture shows.  Other brands such as planet wave have the same string pull problem.  I already had the Planet Wave humidifier and thought this one was smaller and would fit between the strings better.  The thing I do like about it, is that it doesnt leak onto the guitar label once you find a way to get it into the sound hole.",1
1946,I was very satisfied with the construction of this harmanica holder. Very easy to assemble and only a few adjustments to lock down your harp. I recommend this item to biginners as well as intermidiates.,1
1947,It's ok,1
1948,"On the description it says audio interface, you can not use the cue on the sound card unless you configure your dj sotware (trakto) as mono, an it works ok, if you are a club DJ you will notice most of the clubs allready work on mono, so not a big problem, I won't use this card as a DJ set up but it does work ok, great sound.",1
1949,"its a cheap and small guitar amp with no adjustment for mids. What do you expect?
It sounds alright for the guitar I'm pairing it with to give to my cousin.
Throwing my bass tuned to ADGC with some compression and overdrive through this amp sounds killer however, don't reccomend it for long term use, might damage the poor thing tho.",1
1950,"Does the job when the strings are filthy, but still have to use other means to get them really clean.",1
1951,"Kind of just is what it is. It's funcational, but not the most aesthetically pleasing tool there is. If there was a cover over it it would be much better. I might just end up putting some bandanas over it or something. Eh idk, can't really find a product online that has the sides covered. But hey, it works.",1
1952,"Not real happy with this but then I wanted to save some money.  Not a very good decision on my part.  Should have shelled out the $30-35 for an actual Fender or Fender licensed pickguard so I'll eat this.  But I'm posting so YOU don't have to make my mistake.  Not knocking the company either, they tried but just didn't get it right.  See the pics.",1
1953,"The ukulele is more toy than a ukulele. Decidedly a toy in appearance and materials. Having said all that, there is a ukulele sound even with terribly cheap plastic strings it came with: No the strings on it are not Aquila nylon or fluorocarbon. If you put a set of Aquila strings on it the sound does improve a bit, but then you've spent another $10 plus labor to accomplish that.  So my dilemma; invest more for strings on what I regard as a uke-toy or go the extra dollars and get a Kala Waterman Concert? Oddly enough after going cheap on the strings, the manufacturer has produced a neck and correct scale but set up quite a bit high at the bridge.  I ended up putting on new strings on it and  lowering the saddle over 1/8th""; producing passable sound for an inexpensive  beach ukulele.",1
1954,"My only problem with this pop filter is that the neck of the product is VERY hard to manipulate and it won't ever stay in place. Otherwise it does its job just fine, just a pain to get into place.",1
1955,Pricing is wonkers!,1
1956,"Actually, pretty good, for the price and for the amount of FX included.  This thing will get anyone through the doldrums of not having any sort of effects at their disposal.  I've seen and heard people using this unit - or similar units - for the last 25 years.  It's real simple to use, and utilizes no true skill to program.  You can use it for most instruments, also (although I wouldn't personally use it on electric or acoustic guitar, as there are better boxes out there for those purposes.)  I've used it on keys and bass, so far; both sound great, when processed through this.  It is also a USB unit, so you can plug it directly into your computer.  Worth the money.",1
1957,"The normal click sound is decent. (The voice count option is annoying at best, but you do have options.) It's a good little metronome unit but it also has temperature and time readings, which is just strange. And we don't read Celsius in the US, and most people here don't read military time either. If they were going to make this with a clock, put our normal time and Fahrenheit readings on it! Besides, it's a metronome, why would anyone need the temperature? That part is annoying because you can't turn it off and after a bit it goes back to the 24 hour time readings. I would not buy this again because of that alone. It would be better without all the extraneous stuff.",1
1958,What can you say.  This thing is what it is.  No more no less.  If you wanna raise the strings......here you go.,1
1959,"Decent, nothing more. Seems to vibrate on some notes on some strings, causing loss of tone and sustain. Bought this to compare to the Lotmusic version, which seems much more solid.
Use this one when the bridge on your sits close to the body, since the Lotmusic one is a little deeper on the bottom.",1
1960,"They work.  Right angles are not flat, so pedals must be separated by about 2 inches.",1
1961,"the clasp broke within 2 days, so I used Velcro ""spots"" and repaired it....just OK.....wouldn't buy again",1
1962,Worth the price. They work. But the tray is plastic. If it falls itll likely break. Prob will fall its heavier than youd expect,1
1963,"I ordered this ukeout of pure curiosity. It's different to say the least! Seems well constructed,the sound is not like a wooden uke,it is after all, made from plastic,has a empty barrel sound? Difficult to explain. This is a fun,take along uke,not to be taken to seriously. With that in mind,and the low price point,and the Aquilla strings,seems worth the price.",1
1964,"Well...the title of the review pretty sums it up. This is made in China....it sounds and feels like it was made in China. It has a very difficult time staying in tune - and that's not because of the Bigsby tailpiece alone. The neck feels flimsy to me....Its a 'D' styled neck, not too wide but kind of thick. It's set neck, not a bolt on and these would normally be quite stable, but it doesn't seem so to me. If you handle the neck even slightly rough - suppose your really getting into a lick or playing a tough series of chords so you grasp the neck strongly while doing so, the thing can get out of tune...it can not take it. I have quite a few other guitars and this seems to be a problem with Epiphones in general (I had an Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro that had the same problem - but this is not a problem with the other guitars I own - Yamaha, Gibson, Fender and Aria). I like the P90 pickups...not bad for this style guitar. The workmanship is average - typical Chinese quality - okay if you don't look too close.  The upper master volume knob doesn't seem to have much of any effect and all the knobs are misaligned and on somewhat crooked. The placement of the Bigsby can interfere with adjustment of the volume and tone controls, but they don't seem to really have the same dynamic range of tonal effect you'd expect anyway. Overall, if this didn't look as nice as it does, I wouldn't care for this much at all, but Epiphone has put together a very beautiful looking guitar that sounds ...well, okay.....so for the price, it's a decent buy. If this were to be your only guitar and all you had to spend was $400, I'd tell you to buy something else..like an Ibanez  - but for a 2nd or 3rd...4th or 5th guitar, this is okay and looks great hanging on the wall....and doesn't sound terrible...just okay",1
1965,"I was really interested in the M3 and checked with the Fender forum and I found that there is a problem with the M3.  You can go to the Fender forum and read about it under the Mustang amp section.

To make the long story short, some(not all) M3, M4, M5's have what is decribed as a ""fizz"" on the clean setting when hitting the low e string.  Sometimes it's noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible.  Some people think it's the power supply but nobody knows for sure.  Apparently, Fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a 'fizz' problem.  There is also a sample sound clip there on this 'fizz'.

Like I said, I just want people to know about this before buying a M3. Now, I am considering the M2 which also has the 'fizz' problem but with the the software fix released from Fender, there is no 'fizz' in the M2. I don't know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because I didn't get the M3, but if I bought it, I would give it a rating of 3 stars because I don't like this 'fizz' on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me.  If it didn't have this 'fizz' I would give it a 5 star rating.",1
1966,"Important controls like volume and sliders are VERY cheap feeling.  Sound is good and clear.  Buttons seem to be accurate.  Jog wheel is adequate, but I wouldn't plan on doing any serious mixing.  Perfect for ceremonies, emergency backup or backyard parties.",1
1967,"First off, this thing works as advertised. It's fine for what it is made to do, there are just a few areas I wish it was a little better in. For one thing, it is very tall. That's great if your keys player isn't also the main vocalist.

Ours isn't short by any definition and the second tier goes to the top of her shoulders. They made absolutely certain that you weren't going to have a problem reaching the back of the lower tier keyboard. A height adjustment of the tier would have been GREAT.

The second thing that I thought was weak was the replacement plugs that come with it. They have these huge tassels on them that look ridiculous. We just continue to use the old plugs when the top tier isn't needed because the tassels would look strange hanging on the front.",1
1968,Vater makes their 5A bigger in diameter than some and the added length made these really heavy. Felt and played more like a heavy 5B. I couldn't use them.,1
1969,"First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them, they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.

Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable ""plinking"" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.

So, too bad.  I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material.",1
1970,This is just great! It was exactly what I was looking for and at a fair price as well. It was a little smaller than I had imagined. I highly recommend this product.,1
1971,Made a little cheap but it's holding up. For the price I would buy 2 more.,1
1972,"I was looking for a nice set of gold strap buttons to upgrade my Les Paul and purchased these after seeing the many positive reviews.

I genuinely prefer the added safety that oversized (aka: mushroom) strap buttons provide over many factory style buttons in keeping the strap in place while moving and playing...inexpensive insurance for any instrument!

I purchased my buttons from the seller ""Greenten"" as they had the best price with Prime shipping.

Unfortunately, the buttons I received aren't nearly as nice as the pictures show.  The buttons I received have a noticeably rough surface and the gold plating is a much brighter yellow than the gold hardware I have on any of my guitars.  The buttons won't be as noticeable with a strap installed, but there is much room for improvement in the finish department.

So, while the strap buttons will get the job done, they appear to be of rather low quality and don't look nearly as nice as most stock gold hardware typically does.

If you do decide to take your chances on these strap buttons, I'd recommend avoiding Greenten as the seller.  Perhaps some of the other sellers have nicer versions in stock.

All in all, these strap buttons are ""ok"" for the price, but I wouldn't recommend them for a nicer instrument.",1
1973,The clamp spring is not strong enough,1
1974,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this.
Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.
I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!

I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.
I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.

If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood.",1
1975,"Yes it cleans. 6 pack ? not nearly enough. I feel like i need to ""save"" them for important use since there are only 6. so basically i hardly ever use them. haha. it does a fine job of cleaning though.",1
1976,"If you want a good (build) quality, good sounding (mostly) digital modelling amp that is at a good price, then you've come to the right product. If you want a plug-and-play, easy to use amp that requires a short learning curve - then you've come to the WRONG product. I'm not computer illiterate and I'm not a musical gear newbie - but I found this amp to be a HELL of a confusing product to use where you have to muck around with the 'FUSE' software to even get it to work properly - there is NO easy to understand paper manual, EVERY preset comes drenched in HUGE reverb that once you turn it off and think that you've saved it - next time you turn the amp back on the massive, gloopy reverb is back. I was sold a dog by an overzealous salesman who didn't want to ensure I knew what I was getting - he just wanted to shift units - so I soon took it back. Unless all that software and editing cr4p is your thing - don't buy this amp if you are merely a guitarist who wants to turn it on and merely PLAY. All that 'community software' stuff is junk. Fender: there are a surprising number of musicians who don't care about your silly 'FUSE' software. But at least you're smart enough to make the very good 'CHAMPION' range of digital amps - they lack most of the fiddly junk and sound almost as good as the Roland Cubes and Blackstar ID series.",1
1977,"All of the effects on this unit are adequate. The box is well made, but plastic. I wouldn't suggest this for playing out, but for home use it is a solid addition. It allows me to ""play"" with some sound effects that I wouldn't have otherwise paid to have.",1
1978,"Sound is good.  The screw holes in the pickup stripped quickly, which has never happened before, and I had to screw it into the body, which is not my preference.",1
1979,A little too thick for the guitar they were put on.  I'm sure they are great on the right guitar since the lighter gauges are nice.,1
1980,Works fine but is very cheap feeling.,1
1981,good for what you pay & clear sound,1
1982,"Right, so.

This Ernie Ball tuner with stand is something that would come in really handy in a guitar/ukulele shop.  The stand with clamp is clearly meant to be used when setting up a stringed instrument, or replacing strings.  There's a button that allows you to ""Change Modes"" from Guitar, to Violin, to Ukulele, etc., but really, if you know your instrument, you'll know what each string is supposed to be tuned to and thereby know how far off you are.  If you don't know, then this would be highly useful! (BTW, the button for toggling modes is also the Power Button)  The clamps on said stand have silicon rubber grips, so they won't ding up your headstock.

The tuner *does* come off of the stand, so you can use the tuner on its own.  The tuner uses a standard 3 volt CR2032 battery found in all digital clip-on tuners. Ernie Ball made it easy to replace the battery, which is good thing because...

I pulled the plastic battery protector and fired up the tuner.  AND... wow, the screen was really dim.  They promise a ""vibrant LCD display"" but boy was it not working as advertised. (Side Note: ""LCD display"" is redundant. Much like ""ATM Machine"" or ""IRA Account""... sigh.)  The whole thing seemed to function correctly, but the screen nearly unreadable.  I nabbed a fresh battery from my stash and tried again. Still, dim display. I tried to get a picture of it, but the screen is so reflective, all you see are my knuckles holding my phone.

I do like this thing, and might still use it when doing my yearly string replacements on my guitar and ukuleles; but this screen is just sad.",1
1983,"These are fine, but not as good in any category as laBella  760 flats. I would say that they are a little better than Rotosound monel flats due to their more consistent strings to string output.",1
1984,Okay seriously? I had to drill a hole near the bottom of the strap so it would fit me. And it's STILL is too big. Yeah it's great quality but at least mention that it's like 3XL! Definitely not for people under 6 feet tall.,1
1985,It works. It's overpriced. The quality is ok. I made better ones cheaper using Amphenol ends. But these did the trick till I got the good ones soldered up.,1
1986,I prefer the 515 pick over the 514.  This seems to have a louder pickier sound but not as good quality as the 515.,1
1987,Made well and seems like it will last but it remains to be seen. The only thing is that the seat will not spin if you lock it in place so you can pick it up by the seat but a non issue for me.,1
1988,It's a sturdy cable and a bit heavy.  Beware if you own a Telecaster.  The right angle quarter inch will not lock inside a Tele.  I have given this cable away to a friend of mine that owns a Stratocaster and it fits like a charm on his guitar.,1
1989,did not realize 39 inch was not full size,1
1990,"This is a budget vibra-slap that works well enough. The sound is sharper, more metallic and the sustain not as long as more expensive versions I've tried.",1
1991,good,1
1992,"It's hard to knock this for what it is, it's a good swab, but I had to knock off points because the handle keeps pulling off. I've resorted to the hot glue gun trying to fix it now. It needs a different method for attaching the wire structure to the plastic, this doesn't hold it well.",1
1993,A little disappointed.  The rubber part goes too far down onto the pick and catches on the strings.  I do like the sound so I will play with it a little and see if I can make it work.,1
1994,This clamp matches well with the microphone gooseneck.  It secures the gooseneck on a table edge nicely.  The only problem is that the plastic pad on top of the clamping screw broke into two halves when I tried to tighten it by hand.  It would be a one-star review had I not found a piece of non-skidding furniture pad that fit the screw to repair it.,1
1995,"It's compact, metal, it seems pretty durable other than the small toggle that scares me a bit.  That hot/warm switch is a nice eq option, though.  It's a fairly dark OD pedal, and I find I usually run the tone wide open or close to it--with some setups it's too dark.  It seems to be true bypass.  Interestingly, with no power (and it can't take a battery), you still need to click the switch to get bypass--otherwise, no signal.

Word on the street is that this is based on Mooer's Green Mile, which is supposedly based on the Ibanez Tube Screamer.  Relative to the TS, there is more gain with this pedal.  The TS gives better high-end, but the hot switch gives you better low end than a TS.  As an OD pedal, this is a decent buy, a lot more practical and durable than many you could buy at this price, but not one that kills on sound alone.  I think the Behringer TO800 is still the best TS808 clone out there in terms of audaciously faithful sound/circuit reproduction.  You can get a lot of good, useful blues or rock sounds out of this pedal, but it's probably not gonna kick your favorite Screamer clone off the pedalboard.",1
1996,The item works but the red is nothing like what was pictured. The one we got was closer to orange than to red.,1
1997,"It is definitely worth the money.  I am a semi-professional musician and this pedal has served me well.  I wish it was made of the same high quality casing as my other pedals, but for $20 its worth it and it tunes perfectly and hasn't failed me yet.  Definitely worth it, unless you are looking for a sturdier pedal.",1
1998,A bit too soft but given the fact it does say made of suede you should expect it to be super soft.  Better for lighter guitars IMO,1
1999,"While this product has a very good reputation, it did not compliment the sound of my Vox ac15c1.  The cleans were good, but JJ's seem to sound better in my v1 and v2 positions.  Again, I am sure that they would work well in other darker sounding amps or stereos--just didn't give me the 'wow,' that I wanted to hear.",1
2000,I just bought my fourth one. They are perfect. Very accurate tuning and they don't compete with my capo for space on the headstock. I love that you can clip it on the backside and flip the display around. And that makes them invisible to the audience. The swivel feature makes it work on all of my guitars' different headstock shapes.,2
2001,"These are a great replacement/upgrade for Fender amps. Many Fender combos come with those metal feet, which I think are not good features. Metal feet are not friendly on wood floors, they don't really isolate the cabinet from the floor, and they're just so darn small. I've removed the metal feet from all my Fender amps and replaced them with these Peavey feet, which remind me of the hefty rubber feet that come on Vox amps. Sure enough, they're just perfect! They're just the right size to provide isolation without looking ridiculous, and if you have something like a Vibrolux, they're small enough to coexist next to metal amp corners.

Comes with mounting screws, too. These screws are PZ type, not Phillips head, so just be aware of that and use the correct drivers for them, and you'll have no problems at all.",2
2002,Sound great,2
2003,"I used these for 2 arts & motion classes. They were great quality. We even embellished them with beads, gems & hot glue. All of them worked. Loved the color variety.",2
2004,"Solid build, quality product, inexpensive.",2
2005,perfect little tray for what I needed,2
2006,"The Bach Silver Polish Cloth does a nice job, but like all Silver Polish Cloths I have tried, it gets dirty pretty fast.",2
2007,"Handy, compact ruler!",2
2008,"The Texas special pickups bite! When you want a beefy solo, they full the bill. It's  no that they don't sound beautiful clean, playing chords, but it is a lead guitar at heart! In surf green, I get complimented before she comes out of the case. Then when you slip into that first soaring lead, jaws f'ing drop! I had a mid-70s strat that I was forced to sell a few years back and I always would talk about how much I miss her. This fat mama, does everything she did with lower action and a little more attitude. All in all, I can't recommend it highly enough. Amazon made it easy.",2
2009,amazing,2
2010,I've been searching for a decade. These are the ones.,2
2011,Great sounding analog phaser. I get a bit confused with the 3 way switch and sometimes accidentally engage it when stomping it on or off on a dark stage... but overall I love this thing and the couple other Earthquakers I have,2
2012,"Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others.  This is not true isolated outputs, but it is quiet and that is what counts.  I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best, mainly because of the 500ma output.

2018,"I'm using these for an 11 channel pre-amp/amp configuration. They work. They're a good length for my application, and the colors are convenient for keeping the channels separated.

I'm not sure what would make these particularly better or worse than any other XLR patch cords. The main thing you try to do is keep your AC current cables away from your low voltage / DC cables, and never run them in parallel with each other, so I don't know if these are particularly well shielded or anything else special, but they do the job (connecting a pre-amp to an amp) and they are easy to work with (which is a big bonus in tight places).",2

2022,"I have a boss DD3 but I love the sound of a nice analog delay.  I had bought a EH Memory Man some time back but I found it noisy and a bit of a tone sucker.  I bought this pedal because I had recently gotten the BBE Soul Vibe which I love(see review).  So far all the BBEs I've tried have been well made, have ture bypass and, most importantly, sound great.

I had been looking at the Ibanez and a couple of other analog delays but these pedals can be quite expensive.  Amazon's price(as usual) was the cheapest through GTPro.

This pedal gives a very warm, lush delay.  You get two seperate delay times you can switch back and fourth from.  The delay times are short at 330ms, but the sound is beautiful.  It was much quieter and sounded much more natural to my ears than the EH MM that I had.  Perfect for slap back or just nice early delay sounds.  For example a little dirt/fuzz and you can nail the Red House solo tone.  This is a great compliment to a digital delay which can handle longer times and crystal clear sounds better than analog.

My only complaint is that, although you get two delay times you can switch between, you only get on mix and one repeat knob for both channels.  Having separate EQs for each channel would really make this an over the top knockout.  However it's still a great pedal especially at this price.  Since I've gotten it I find that I just get it set and leave it on all the time.  It adds wonderful depth to my tone.",2

2025,"I have two Snark's, the SN-1 and SN-2. I've had the SN for years and It has been as accurate as any foot pedal tuner and you know how much they cost. I really like the SN-2 even better because of it's extended range and built in mic. The build quality and gripping power of the jaws is very impressive. I own 12 guitars and it fits any and all of them tightly and the swivel head feature allows viewing from any angle. I will never own any other clip on tuner!",2
2026,"I recently went back to Analog into my Tube Amp.
This I have in my Serial FX Loop.
It does very little to color you're tone, but it sounds so sweet.
I use 1 setting for everything. 9:00 mix, 1:00 Delay, 10:00 regen, Mod ON.
My Cleans are incredible, feels and sounds like I have so much more than just a delay on it.
Same setting works great to 80s up my Crunch Tone.
Same setting sends my Leads Soaring.

2030,"I was extremely pleased with this microphone. I had never used this brand before, but received a discount to give them a try. I was looking for a microphone for my MacBook, and this was a compatible option. It was practically plug-n-play.

The sound is pretty good. I don't think Beyonc will be recording on it, but for chatting, and gaming, this works really well. The sound is about as perfect as I need it. This was a massive upgrade over my laptops built-in mic.

The only drawback I've noted is that it's very lightweight, and when on the stand it's rather top heavy. I've knocked it over a few times, even just moving the USB wire. It's a minor inconvenience, but doesn't detract from the usability. As previously stated, I received this item at a discount for my honest review. I honestly an glad I took the chance on an unknown, to me, brand. I'm looking into their other products.",2

But the once that they give , they just sound freaking amazing.... The Halo function ... Pffff amazing for solo playing.... This pedal is a MUST in every pedal board! Got rid of my holy grail and got this gem... Digitech definitely is stepping up... Got the Obscura Altered Delay a couple of weeks ago and I'm still trying to tame that beast... Don't hesitate...

2037,"This has been a great first guitar. If it didn't have an Applause logo I think I could pass it off for an actual Ovation! I've had it for a good 6 months and it still smells new. The guitar fits nicely on your lap due to the curved back, the color is great (fretboard, headstock, body), and the sound is amazing. The guitar also has a nice feel on the back of the neck. You have been warned though that the body and tuning pegs are fingerprint magnets so if you want it looking good be sure to give it a wipe down every now and then. The B string broke after about 4 months of playing casually everyday and there is an ever so slight buzz when you do play. I'd stick with using light strings after the stock strings pop because the thicker you go, the more apparent the buzz is. But again, the buzz is slight. Also be warned that this product is for the guitar and the guitar alone. You WILL have to buy your own strap and I would recommend buying a case. Overall, for a beginner, this guitar is great. It's comfortable, feels good, and most importantly sounds and smells great.",2

I hate when you buy a strap and the pieces that connect the guitar and the strap are flimsy. these are not. they are nice and thick and give me confidence my bass won't slip out and fall..

2048,"As mentioned in another review, reeds are difficult to remove from this holder, especially if you insert them with too much force.  Additionally, and related, the part that holds the reed in place is hard and inflexible.  I'm noticing a ""dent"" on the top surface of the reeds stored in this holder as a result.  Determining whether or not this affects the sound or longevity of the reed is beyond my playing and listening abilities, but if you are very picky and protective of your reeds, you will probably want to look elsewhere.

The Conn-Selmer reed holder, similar in appearance and function, seems to work much better.  Instead of a hard piece of plastic serving to hold the reed in place, it uses an elastic band for each of the reed slots, making it much easier to remove reeds and not denting them.

Update 12/3/13: I've warmed up to this reed holder a bit more, and upgraded to 4 stars.",2

It made it uncomfortable to operate the treadles of the loom.  This bench is fantastic, sturdy, and the height is adjustable, which makes it far more comfortable to sit at my loom.  The height also adjusts downward, to suit my sewing machine table and set-up.

It is Lightweight which is good for carrying but is definitely not as sturdy and stable as some other options that cost way more.  With that being said, it is sufficient for my needs and I am not exactly a light hitter.

It holds my Djembe just fine and the Gon Bops Djembe Cajon even better.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.  I have even taken it to Jams but mostly use it in my home.

It is well worth the cost of the unit and would almost buy two of these rather than 1 heavy duty stand..  Thanks for the good product!",2
2058,"I need to convert to a pair of headphones at church when I am playing the drums in services,from a PA monitor that sits behind me in the floor. Currently I play with a pair of blue ear protection ear muffs which work fine. But I have been desiring to go to headphones. I took this amp to church and used it one time and it worked ok. However,when I plugged in the jack cable from the monitor to the amp,it only gave me a mono signal and I heard the music out of one ear only. I need to get a stereo adapter to give me a stereo signal so I can hear through both earphones. The separate volume knobs makes it good to adjust the volume in the earphones themselves.

2061,"You've probably already watched 100 youtube videos spelling out the details.
These are my thoughts as they pertain to my situation - I play guitar in a worship band (similar style to jesus culture)

PROS:
* Expression pedal control over feedback is excellent.  Can create some really fun pad sounds.  I'm using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yamaha-FC7-Volume-Control-Pedal/dp/B000UJHIS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yamaha FC7 Volume Control Pedal</a>&nbsp;and it works great.
* Only analog delay <$200 that has tap tempo
* Nice warm fuzzy analog tone

MEHS:
* The tone is very warm, and I like it, but if you're expecting a tone quality like diamond or strymon or even just a carbon copy, this will disappoint.  Don't get me wrong - it's good.  Perhaps even great.  But it doesn't stand up to ""the best"".  It's also less than half the price of ""the best"".
* This pedal has introduced a faint hum when used directly in my amp's FX loop.  It's not strong, but it's noticeable.

CONS:
* When you tap tempo with a sub-division, the LED flashes also change to reflect the sub-division.  I wish it just continued blinking at the originally tapped quarter note tempo.  Not enough to take a star off, just a personal preference
* If you're playing, and tap a new tempo, the changing delay times will cause the existing delays to go crazy.  This is a cool effect if you're playing with the delay KNOB, but when you're just trying to get the tap tempo ""just right"" it really messes up your playing in the song.  Unless you're completely silent, you can't tap in a new tempo.
* Not really a con, just an FYI - this delay will NOT give you crisp, perfectly repeated notes that mimic exactly what you played.  For that you need a digital delay.  This particular style analog delay is much warmer; an almost ""muted"" repeat.  It's meant to enhance the overall tone, not multiply the number of notes being played.",2
2062,"These are just re-branded Kaces soft gig bags. For the price range, this is the best padded bag you are going to find, period. They are perfectly adequate for basic passenger vehicle type transportation. I wouldn't recommend using them for investment grade guitars, but for mid to low range guitars these are perfect. They fit most standard Strat/Tele style bodies, as well as most head-stock styles, reverse or standard; including the infamous hockey stick styles that give so many other bags trouble. My Kramer Baretta and BC Rich Gunslinger had no problems. These cases will also fit the Fender Stratacoustic, albeit snugly.",2

The stupid plastic things made by Fender and others break so freakin fast, they're not worth the trouble and for the life of my I could never hear any difference in the tone of my guitar depending on the pick used. The thickness of the pick affects the tone, but not the material the pick is made of.

This pack comes with 12 picks. It had been a while since I used these and I seem to recal the .60mm pick being a little thicker. So I might move up to the .73mm. But in any case. Great picks.",2

I read on another eventide pedal review of the same thing happening so Amazon must have mixed up stock placing SPACE pedals in a place that was meant for a different pedal. I sent it back, was refunded, so all is well. I then ordered this pedal elsewhere and received it A-OK. As for the Pedal, it is a 5 star pedal all the way. I have had the Hall Of Fame, Stereo WET and Hardwire Reverb. This literally kills them all. Lush, organic, and HUGE. No noise. It is a high quality effect and it shows. Using it with a Fender Princeton Reverb along with a Carbon Copy delay. Superb.",2
2079,"These cases can be great, but be careful as they are inconsistent in quality. I own two of these cases for my Schecter Stiletto basses, a Stiletto Custom-5 and a Sam Bettley Stiletto-4.

I've had the case for the Custom-5 for 2 and a half years now. It fits the larger 5 string body nicely. The lining is still in great shape and hasn't bunched up at all. The latches are also still spot on and I've never had to jiggle the lid to line it up. The case isn't ideal for anything more than the car or a van ride, but is a 5 star case for protection and quality at the price point.

Now, for the second one.. When I received this case a month ago, it smelled terribly of plastic and I had to air it out for a few days before I could put my bass in it. The lining feels stiffer and was already bunched up in several spots, unlike the other case. The 4 string body fits a little more loosely than the 5 string, but it doesn't move around during transport. The latches don't always line up and I find myself wiggling the lid to get them to shut. It definitely feels more cheaply made but the cases are from the same production run, so be careful what you get.

Pros-
+Decent protection
+Only case that fits the Stiletto bass properly
+Lining gets the job done
Cons
-Quality control-make sure you get a good one
-Oddly sized storage compartments

Note- If you own a Sam Bettley Stiletto bass like I do, the strap mount is in a different place on that bass than other Stilettos. It will miss the lower strap mount cutout in the case. I made my own depression by hand where the Sam Bettley's strap mount is and now it fits perfectly into the case.",2

With the Tascam, I had great difficulty getting volume out of my condenser mics; basically I had to turn the gain up almost all the way to get a reasonable signal. The phantom power/mic inputs on the 2i4 are vastly superior. I can get a very good signal from the mics, in fact, I can even max it out! The same goes for my acoustic guitars. I have one guitar that has a very quiet output; with the 2i4, again I can max out the signal.

I've captured the signal from the 2i4 with Audacity, GarageBand, and Ableton Lite with no difficulty. The signal comes in very clean. As a fingerstyle guitar player, the 2i4 will give me a lot of flexibility with my recording. This unit will improve the sound quality of my recordings overall. So, it was a great purchase for the price. I'm looking forward to many great recordings with it.",2

2116,"I have spent some time with this instrument (albeit from a different vendor) and think it is a professional-quality instrument for an intermediate instrument's price.  It is especially well-suited for modern finger-style playing.

The parlor guitar all but disappeared in the 1960s with the advent of popular folk music in club and concert venues.  Most pro performers then preferred ""dreadnaught"" guitars for greater volume and projection in large, miked venues.  The novice player looking to purchase a ""better"" guitar quite naturally followed the lead of his idols, not thinking about the more intimate settings in which they would perfom.

Now the 0 guitar makes its return - the machine you see in photos of Robert Johnson and Charley Patton!  The Blueridge BR-3X1 is offered in either mahogany (341) or rosewood (361 - my own preference).  Lutherie and quality control are outstanding.  The guitars project as well as the bigger boys, and their tone is woody and ringing.

I'd never buy a guitar I couldn't play for a while, since individual instruments can vary niticeably.  Look at the seller's return policy and factor in the cost of shipping if you're unhappy.  Still, I expect most players who want a ""guitar sound"" will be very pleased.",2

2118,My favorite pics,2
2119,As advertised and a worth every penny.  Used this on my three guitars the day it came in the mail.  Very satisfactory results.  Thanks.,2
2120,Everything ok.,2
2121,"This is a great sounding warm & natural distortion. I've tried the MXR Classic Distortion, & Distortion III, and the '78 Badass Distortion, and they were just lacking something to me.  This has the crunch I wanted & still sounds natural with NO gritty fizz.  Also, this works well with the Cry Baby wah even when I have the volume boost engaged. The wah volume boost was a problem on some other Distortion boxes because it Over-drove the front end and caused it to lose all tone and turned to mush. I basically set the M75 with all the knobs at noon as the starting point and it sounds very good just like that. I then tweak the 3-band eq very slightly to suit the guitar or amp. Works great with both Tube & Solid State amps. Great purchase, very happy with it.",2
2122,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to shell out 400 bucks on a pair of monitors and stands but after receiving and using the Rokit 6 set up I am now a very happy customer. The sound is amazing. The stand is very easy to assemble and the whole set up is very sleek looking. I recommend these to any DJ hobbyist and anyone into home musical production. These are worth every penny.

******UPDATE*****
After about a year and a half with this set up I have come to this conclusion, these stands sucks. The stands are ultra wobbly. They were pretty bad right out of the box but I thought it was because my carpet was so high. Now that I am on solid ground I now see that these are just poor stands. I fully recommend the speakers, but if you can try to get different stands.",2
2123,"Very high quality sticks. Feel and sound matched. The wood carries more vibrations back to the hand compared to hickory, so beware if you have sensitive hands. However due to being a harder wood it doesn't dent on rimshots like hickory sticks do. Overall a very nice set of drumsticks",2
2124,"Not sure what comments can be made for this guitar being that the Yamaha FG series is the most popular series in the world. I guess that speaks for itself. It's a fine looking guitar and it sound pretty nice. It has a fairly slender neck which makes it user friendly. Not sure whether it's popularity is due to the guitar itself or Yamaha's marketing skills. The bass seem a bit strong. Not as well audio balanced as some guitars in this price range and maybe the sound isn't as well defined as others. However, no two guitars sound exactly alike and I'm sure some FG models sound better than others. I use it as my practice guitar and it works well for that. If the frets get worn or if it get damaged in a mishap, no big deal as this model is very easy to find if I ever want another one. I enjoy playing this guitar but personally, I feel the Alvarez AD series has a much nicer overall sound and it's very easy to play. For more serious playing, I pull out one of my Alvarez instruments.",2

The dynamic response and the sounds produced by the TD4 module are amazing. It got even better when I changed the original snare pad for the PDX100 mesh head and the original bass trigger for the KD-9. I'm also using a double bass pedal Mapex Raptor. The frame is very steady and barely shakes or moves. I connect it to my desktop and record the drum beats using Addictive Drums. There's nothing better at this price point.,2

I can see both the launchpad or the APC as viable alternatives based on ones preferences.

2159,"I bought this in 2011.

This is an amazing portable recorder, even to this day (They released a new version this year in 2016). It is not just for musicians, but also sought after by filmmakers.

The whole look of it is just beautiful and professional. Even the built-in mics not only look cool, but it picks up audio really nicely. However, what attracted me the most was having two XLR inputs on this handheld device that provides 48v phantom power using two AA batteries (I use Eneloops because they're the best)

I love that they made the navigation a scroll wheel and you can just push in to enter; I'm so glad they didn't make the enter a separate button because it really makes navigating smooth.

Not only is it just a handheld field recorder, but you can also connect to it to the computer using mini-USB; then it becomes a USB audio interface and I'm able to record audio directly using my favorite recorder like Adobe Audition and even Skype. It even has built-in effects like reverb that you can add real-time.

This is just an absolutely beautiful well-designed work of art product. This is definitely in the legendary category.",2
2160,"I think for the price range, this mic is pretty unbeatable. I bought this mic after using the Audio Technica AT2020USB, and it was definitely a good mic. I ended up returning it though because I wanted a bigger jump in my audio quality. I'd say as a first XLR mic, this one is definitely a crowd favorite and go-to. I ended up going for the Shure SM7B, but again, this is a huge jump in price. I'd recommend this mic for those starting out on YouTube/Twitch interested in using an XLR mic. Audio Technica makes really good products all the way around, so you can't go wrong.",2
2161,"Honestly I originally bought it thinking it was a guitar strap with a button holder included. I was wrong when just the little strap came, and I laughed at myself. But knew that i would definitely need this, and proceeded to order a strap. My buttons has a picture of a star on it, not like what is pictured. Honestly I would have like the picture design because the start feels to country to me for some reason. But it is made of good quality material and defiantly nicer to have than tying one of those rope things around it. My only gripe is that when I'm standing with it, the strap pulls back and touched some strings slightly and makes the sound duller.

Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, I try to make my reviews as honest and through as possible, so that another person can know exactly what they would get.",2

I found my acoustic instruments sounded softer and more pleasant. I was already detuning my electric anyway so I didn't notice a change. This thing makes detuning easy as well. I like the metronome but I don't use it. Just a bonus. Basically this was everything I wanted when I got the korg GA-1. It's basic. This one does it all. And the seller was great. Fast shipping.,2

2176,Great Product Great Service,2
2177,"I bought one of the ""acoustic"" versions of this stand,  and liked it enough to order another.  Some people say it's not compact or light enough, some say it isn't stable enough (this part I now agree with -see update) -  Folded or unfolded, this stand is compact and not overly heavy - despite the brand name,  I think it's more of a permanent home stand than a travel/stage stand.  Once the back wooden feet are opened up to the maximum angle, this stand is  stable - Most any floor stand is not going to be impervious to kids and critters on the loose.  The one possible issue I see with this stand is the pointy front supports might not work well on a deep shag carpet or other uneven surface. Does display your guitar nicely.

***Update 3/4/16***

Now that I've checked out some other guitar stands, I've changed my opinion on this stand a bit and knocked off  couple stars.  I still  like it, and if you are careful when removing and replacing your guitar it does the job and it looks cool, BUT I've come to the realization that they should have designed a locking mechanism (especially on the back legs)  so that once the stand is opened, it doesn't easily fold.  Other stands I own (the K&M triangular stand and the OnStage tubular metal stands)  lock into open position, or are at least rigid enough in open position to allow you to pick up the stand and move it (while it stays open). With this stand, the back wooden feet move too easily, even if you don't physically move the stand from one spot to the next. If the back feet move from their optimal open position, the support this stand provides becomes dubious. Definitely not a stand for a hectic stage (or home) given its current design.

****Update 5/11/16****

Thanks to a suggestion by Milton C., There IS a fix to the 'floppy feet' problem - You can take a hex wrench and tighten up the play in all of the moving parts to make them stiffer, yet still foldable  - if you are not going to fold the stand at all, you can tighten down the screws even a bit more(don't go too crazy or you could split the wood). I tried this, and it works well.  :)",2
2178,ok,2
2179,Was very happy with my purchase!!,2
2180,I really like this brand of products. I have their tripod stands already and wanted subwoofer stands for when I include the subs in the set up. I had ordered Pyle Pro tripod stands before I purchased the On Stage Stands branded tripods and it was a big mistake. They were cheap and nasty. They were scratched up and I returned them. I learned my lesson so when it was time to order my sub stands......it was a no-brainer. On Stage Stands brand are really nice and are very strong. The mechanisms are reliable which is all that matters to me. Can't beat the price either !!!!,2
2181,Fit perfectly with my telecaster.,2
2182,Great quality. Does what I needed!,2
2183,"This is my second One Spot adaptor, having lost the first one.
The power cord holds up and is beefy and of good length. The adaptor easily powers 6-7 pedals on simultaneously, and I've had no hum issues anywhere, including the studio.

I use good interconnects for my pedals, high quality guitar cables, and I keep the connections and guitar electronics clean and in good condition to minimize any problems, just as general good practice. It's ultimately the multiple connections and complex signal chains that cause cumulative noise issues.

I considered a different, more expensive supply as a replacement, but ended up buying this one again. Why throw more money at something I've never had an issue with?",2
2184,Great product and great service!,2
2185,"Well, for me, this is a Five-Star item. The only negatives are the slight delay in the harmony outputs and the fact that you really have to tinker with the settings to get the most out of this unit. Just be patient, learn the thing's attributes, and you'll be rewarded. Just as good as the TC Helicon comparable item and it's a lot less expensive.",2
2186,"I really like these, easy to use and not pull your guitar out of tune.",2
2187,good enough. thanks.,2
2188,Worked like a charm.,2
2189,"Earlier in the year I bought a Yamaha 3/4 size guitar - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283XPNQ/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which came in a cardboard box, not a case, so have been keeping it on a stand until now. But a relocation is in the offing, and we need to move 2600 miles to a new home, making the cardboard box rather pointless, so I ordered this case.

It is a serious gig bag, well padded, no loose ends, properly sewed, with two zips that open 60% of the bag for access. It comes with a padded neck rest with velcro band to hold it firm. The fit is just right, the guitar sits comfortably within, snugged in but not tight. I took it with guitar inside for a drive in the Jeep, and played it ten miles away, in tune, nothing altered, so this bag is a keeper.

I would recommend the guitar in question to anyone wanting a travel guitar, that is easy on the fingers.",2
2190,"I evaluated this on the basis of making music demos using a professional DAW (Tracktion 3) on both a laptop and desktop. (I bought it for remote recording with my laptop.)

Regarding latency, the built-in audio interface responded to buffer settings in my DAW, with the default setting at 52mS. I was able to reduce the settings to about 20mS, which is still too large for real-time monitoring. However the ""direct monitor"" function on the mic worked fine and my DAW compensated the latency and lined the recording up correctly. On my laptop I had to run Tracktion's ""auto-detect"" function to set the latency compensation correctly. (You can confirm compensation by holding your monitoring headphones up to the mic to record the sound of your DAW's click track. When you zoom in, the recorded click track should fall within a millisecond or two of the beat markers.)

Regarding noise, I recorded myself speaking directly into the mic and compared against my usual recording chain (1"" condenser/preamp/24 bit sound card). After matching levels, the G-track's noise measured only about 6 dB higher. However the character of the noise had a high-frequency emphasis which I think is an artifact of some USB mics. So subjectively I think you can expect about 12 dB worse signal to noise ratio compared with a professional condenser mic. The mic is probably not a good choice for recording quiet sources, but is ok for its intended use of close-miked vocals. You probably won't be bothered by noise recording loud instruments like drum or amped guitars. (Also note that the popular Shure SM57 dynamic mic also has significantly higher noise than the studio setup against which this comparison was made.)

Sound character was fine, though as with most condenser mics I like to apply a broad EQ peak around 1-2kHz to flatter vocals. The mic was not too sensitive to plosives -- as long as you hold the mic away at least 8"". I'd recommend a pop filter or wind screen, homemade or otherwise. I didn't try it on guitar or other instruments, but suspect the high-frequency emphasis would work well for most applications. Anyway I'm a firm believer that a mic's character can easily be changed to suit your needs with EQ plugins. (But don't expect to magically gain the transparency and low distortion of high-end mics.)

The various switches and volume knobs are very useful and logical, the headphone jack is well-placed, and the mic has a nice heft and shape which feels comfortable in your hand. Solid little stand too. A surprisingly high-quality kit for the money.",2
2191,"As Advertised,Fast Delivery,No Problems,",2
2192,Overall a very good pedal.  Happy with it.  Very well made.  Great construction and durable.,2
2193,bought for my wife for when playing drums.  its a good product.  good output to the pa.  tried it also on my guitars and it was accurate.,2
2194,"I purchased this from guitar center because I had a bunch of gift cards. This unit is very good. It is not the best but for the price the tuner and looper alone are worth it. Most of the presets are crazy metal garbage but it isn't very hard to change. It does have the disadvantage of not being able to stomp on and off effects but this can be solved by making a few patches in a row the add or subtract different pedals from your chain and just switching between them. Also the expression pedal can be set to control things like volume or gain so you can adjust on the fly, the tension is also adjustable. All in all very good and for the price it can't be beat.",2
2195,My strings broke and I needed them to be replaced. This did just the trick,2
2196,"The only thing I agree with the first reviewer is the price is a bit too high. Other than that, the one I just bought yesterday (used by the way, still like new) does not have any issue the unlucky person got.
The pickup is there, solid. Both knobs (volume and tone) do what they are supposed to do. The action is low, no fret buzz, sound good plugged to any of my two amps (one is portable, 180watts, the other is a power mixer). No humming either (I tried one at GC and that one hums !!!).
Without plugging in, the sound is just OK for practicing. I also have the Fender 53S (solid top) that sound a lot better, but this one is an acoustic only, costing 300$ brand new.

One thing I learned about buying mandolins: the playability of the mandolin bought from stores is random especially for the low end ones. Most of the time, some adjustment has to be made before it can play well: for example adjust the bridge position to get correct intonation, bridge height so the strings are not too high, but not too low causing fret buzz, tighten screws whererever they are so they do not rattle. So far I have bought two from stores, had to return one, the other one from online and luckily it is well constructed. Also bought 2 used ones (Fender 53S and this Fender 52E), happy with both of them and that all I keep to play at present time.

To avoid all those headaches, buy them used locally, it's cheaper and already has all the adjustment you need (if not, don't buy unless it's a real bargain and you know how to make these adjustments).",2
2197,Works as advertised!,2
2198,"Sound on these is beautiful, rich, and not overbearing to the point where you start losing sound! It's also extremely comfortable and portable. Having the three different cables is nice because I can just unlock the one from my phone or computer, lock in the 1/4"" one, and instantly switch over to my audio mixer without the need for an extra jack (even though the 1/4"" jack unscrews off the coiled cable)",2

2201,good sound - change those strings - you will  be glad you did,2

2204,"Used this to replace a messy Boss daisy-chain cord. Seems to work fine, and I guess the isolation helps a lot because I no longer have to run a ton of isolation transformers when I'm using multiple amps and FX loops together. Fits nicely on the underside of my pedalboard. Has options other than 9V, which I can see being useful but all my pedals are 9V so it doesn't matter to me.

The lights are pointless. They're either all on, or all off. I expected it to light up only the outputs that are used. I keep the lights off because they're those super-bright, blinding, searchlight blue LEDs",2
2205,Used to replace a single-ply pickguard on a Nash guitar. Worked well. Too many holes for a 52 tele but no big deal.,2

2207,Best Metronome. I love Korg products and this does not disappoint. Helps guitar practice immensely! Very happy I got this.,2
2208,"For the price, it's hard to beat. Clamps on easily to your instrument, and the LEDs are super bright and easy to read in the dark. The only downside is that they're relatively small and very easy to leave at gigs.",2
2209,"I've had this strap for years and, minus the discoloration from years of use, its still like new.
The clips still work like day one. No frayed ends. My guitar is safe and sound",2
2210,"This is a great pedal.  The delay effects work great (ala Welcome to the Jungle intro).  But the big benefit is minimizing the delay and using it more of a chorus pedal with a slight delay/reverb, which really adds nice ambiance and clarity to all tones, dirty and clean.  I actually prefer it to a straight chorus pedal. Its really versatile pedal for all tones, with multiple effect choices around the delay.  Also, because it remains in the analog domain, it really does not alter the tone and it remains full and warm (unlike some thin digital based pedals). Now I know why I see it in some many pro's pedal boards.",2
2211,"This was the perfect pedal board for me.  I could use it to travel to gigs, but actually it is just an organizer of my pedals at home.  Works great.  I highly recommend it.",2
2212,"I looked at the 15s and the 10s and always wondered if they were as good as I'd heard, but the asking price at the retail music store was pretty steep.  Then ironically, I found a pair at a pawn shop, the PS-2As and the pawn owner had the pair priced for half of what the single unit cost! (He thought they were overseas junk).  I grabbed them and haven't looked back.  These babies have been pumping hard for me now going on two years.  I use them at weddings and birthday parties from 25 up to 300 people.  I put them on 8 foot crank stands and have even knocked out the fly holes and put in c-clamps to hold extra lighting right on top of each cabinet.  Now I am seriously thinking about picking up a pair of the TS115As, sounds like these are as good as their baby brothers! Light weight, rugged (I dropped mine from a loading dock to the ground 6 feet below and aside from a scuff, it turned on and cranked full power.  Still does!  Yeah sure, you're not going to do any raves with these.  But for something that is easy to set up and haul around, you can't beat these speakers.  In my opinion.",2
2213,Perfect fit for short scale Fender Squire bass guitar..love it.,2
2214,This Bigsby really heightened the sound of my old Les Paul guitar.  Real Neil!  So much mass the guitar sounds a lot like Les Paul's 'rail' made from a section of railroad track.  This model is also used on Gibson ES 330s and 335s.,2

So far this is the only windscreen I have seen available for the Tascam DR-07 MKII recorder.

2225,"Generally, I try to avoid anything and everything made in China, especially with guitars....but, I have to say, this is probably one of the more decent ones. Sticking to the original standards of a pine wood body and alnico 5 pickups, give this guitar the edge that the untrained possibly even trained ear wouldn't pick up on....possibly even prefer over the 52 American reissue. If you're brand spanking new, looking for cheap and quality, or even a seasoned Tele/Strat player looking for ""something cheap for jamming purposes"" I'd say go for this one. 4 stars rather than 5 due to minor adjustments needed at unwrapping...Make doubly sure the screws and output jack are tightly secure, and it's safe to say it's going to need a nut upgrade. I've only owned it for a couple of months, so I cannot vouch for its longevity but will update if necessary.",2

2231,"I am new to the world of harmonicas and have been learning to play for only a couple months. I have a couple Hohners, an old Echo and a Bluesband. After alot of research I decided my first serious harp would be a Seydel Blues Session. I am very happy with that decision. This harp is loud, easy to bend and makes even a bad player (me) sound good. It made me see what a waste of time a 5 dollar harp is, beyond just deciding if you were going to get serious about playing. I love how these are hand made still and it just feels like a quality instrument. I still want to try a Suzuki Promaster, but my next purchase is going to be a Seydel 1847 Noble. Okay thats a bit pricey, maybe a 1847 classic....",2

2241,"I like this pedal. I'd compare it to the morning glory or other low game pedals. This takes it a step further by adding treble in the bass knobs. You could fine-tune it from in front of your amp instead of going back to the amp controls and having your knees and feet here the sound from above the speaker projection.  It's my main source for tone.  I leave it on all the time. Built like a tank , all their petals are built solid. Not Rippin sustain overdrive. Just a glassyy crunch",2
2242,"I love the heavy feel responsiveness to very light breath and loud volume.. The black finish on the covers is very smooth and more comfortable to amy lips than any other harp I have played... I played it and a Bluesmaster, both in the same key of A and found that they both sounded exactly the same... That is not a put down of the Hammond but a testament to the quality of sound the lesser priced harp has.. The Hammond has a luxurious feel to it that makes it a joy to play but both it and the Bluesmaster shares the same reeds.. The opening at the back of the Hammond  other Promaster models is larger than the Bluesmaster models and the Promasters also have an aluminum comb that a seems to allow for cleaner  more refined sounding single note blows and draws.. It is probably not at all apparent when playing through an overdriven amplifier but it is to me when playing without amplification and my hearing isn't all that great..",2
2243,"Best strings I've used in my life. I've been looking for strings that utilize a wound G that weren't too heavy nor too light, and these delivered. D'Addario has always made great strings and I have yet to encounter any that broke on me. Though these strings are advertised for Blues and Jazz (which they are still great for) I would honestly recommend these to Metal players as well. For people who are always changing the tuning on their guitar, these string can take whatever you throw at it. I change my tuning anywhere from E standard to Open C and these strings handle it like a champ.",2

2254,Bought this for a friend of ours who likes purple and didn't want others stealing his capo. He uses the curve at the top to hold his cigarette. I've bought this kind for my husband before as well in black. They work great for changing keys without having to completely retune the guitars to another key in the middle of a gig. I have several musician friends wanting me to order this capo for them in different colors now. The seller sent the exact item pictured and the shipping was quick. The price was pretty good too considering how much our local music store charges for a capo that doesn't stay. This one grips the strings tight enough not to shift while playing. Easy to put on and move as well. Would definitely purchase again.,2
2255,Price and service,2
2256,"I bought this tuner primarily to have it as my primary buffer on my pedalboard. It definitely surpassed my expectations. I actually didn't know you could daisy chain this with other pedals to provide even more power! That's super cool. Of course, they wouldn't be fully isolated but that's super handy if I were to just go jam somewhere and I wanted to take a smaller pedalboard. Or even on my main pedalboard, I can add even more pedals! What's not to like.",2

2262,"Just replaced Nanoweb coated Elixer 80/20 PBs with these on my Santa Cruz OM/PW the other evening.  Distinct and bright; I just love a new set of strings.  I'm sure these uncoated strings won't last as long as the Elixers, but they're a great short term improvement.",2
2263,"I'm predisposed toward D'Addario products.  I've used their strings for quite some time and always found them to be high quality.  That quality extends to this line of cables. This is a heavy-duty guitar cable that has flexibility in spite of its heft.  Components are solid, with a noticeable gold tip.  Planet Waves claim special qualities for this tip.  Compared to most cables, it's a bit more bulbous.  The claim is for better contact.  Possibly true--I plugged it into everything I've got and had no failures.

The only place where I might fault the cable is the lack of external strain relief and sealing.  While there is relief on the inside of the jack shell, there's none on the outside.  It's possible for dirt to get into the cable and possible for a good yank to cause a little damage.  Aside from that, it's a perfectly good cable.",2

2269,"Nice, very useful.",2
2270,"This is pretty much the only capo that you will ever need. The only downside, if you consider it a downside, is if you don't like the adjustable tension. If you just want a capo that you can move to any fret in seconds, then get a capo that's like that; this capo is more for people that baby their guitars and don't want to mess up the tuning or are delicate about their strings. This is clear in the description and picture though, so you should know what you're getting.  Also, I've found that this isn't good for partial capo-ing, where you only put it on, say, the first five strings. But with some fiddling, it can work. This is the capo I use for playing at home for my more expensive guitars that I want to take care of, and it does that job spectacularly",2

2287,"I purchased the PO-20 immediately after buying the PO-12 Rhythm, and while I have not tried all (most) of the Pocket Operators, I felt like those two were the first that I should own.  The Sub (PO-14) and Lead (PO-16) have some great sounds, but also some forehead smacking limitations (No sharps or flats?! Scale essentially locked to C major!?).  But the PO-20 Arcade is a treasure trove of 80's nerd nostaligia along with a rich combination of rhythm, bassline, lead, chord, and drone possibilities that make this the type of device you can make some pretty interesting loops with just a little experimentation.

If you are unfamiliar with the Pocket Operator gadgets from Teenage Engineering, I'll defer to my other review of the PO-12 for the physical attributes of the device, since all 6 of the PO's are largely the same in build quality and button arrangement.  As I stated in the other review, these Pocket Operators are extremely fragile (and, hence, not really ""pocket""-friendly), but for only $60 they pack amazing functionality and endless fun into a very affordable package.

The PO-20 Arcade really stands out in this lineup due to the variety of what it does.  At first glance, it would be easy to assume it's a niche product for chiptunes or video game-style bleeps and bloops.  While it definitely has a chiptune or ""8-bit"" emphasis to its sounds, it has a surprising level of musical depth.  There are 16 ""sounds"" available, but while about half of them include chiptune synth hits (bass, bass drum, tom, blip, noise, etc.), the other half includes 3 different arpeggios, a vibrato tone, and an echo/reverberating tone.  Morevover, rather than traditional effects (such as distortion and filters), the 16 effects include things like fills, retriggers, glitches, and universal arpeggios that rhythmically and musically modify your pattern on the fly.  It's really quite difficult to explain how this works in practice, other than to say that you can take a pretty simple arcade pattern and morph it into something complex and beautiful just by adding a few effects.

My favorite features (and the ones that turn this little device into a backing track generation monster), are the chords and drones.  Using chords numbered 1-16 (each number corresponds to a preset chord, like Dm, Em, Esus, E, F, G, C/G, etc.), you can program a chord progression up to (I believe) 128 bars in length.  It's a bit of mystery to me what this actually does, except that if you program a chord sequence over a pattern with various sounds, it will tweak that pattern to match the chord structure.  Even cooler, if you hold the chord button and twist the ""A"" (left) knob, it will introduce a sustained ""drone"" chord matching the chord progression you programmed.  This can be further tweaked to range from static chords, to swells, and glitch-style stutters.  All of this is BPM synced to the tempo you set for the song, so you can create loops and even longer progressions and songs that sound like finished products.

The thing I like about the PO-20 Arcade is that it introduces just the right degree of ""hand holding"" to allow someone with virtually no understanding of music theory to create complex arpeggios and progressions that otherwise would have taken a lot of knowledge and time to generate from scratch.  But it does this without going too far down the path of being a music toy, or completely taking the control away from the user as to the content being generated.  If you're not a fan of chiptune or video game sounds in music, then the PO-20 might just not be for you.  But for $60, I think it's one of the better implementations of an entire style of music out of the entire Pocket Operator lineup.  You'd be forgiven for assuming it's a plastic noise effects toy, but with a little work to learn how it works (which I'm still doing), it proves to be much more.",2
2288,"It took me several years of cracked, bleeding fingers to figure out what it was from. My nickel wound strings! My finger tips would get so bad, that I couldn't actually play (which would cause my finger rot to go away). I actually found out using google and ran across a website talking about guitar players with ""finger rot"". The consensus on the site was these magic strings. Not only did my ""finger rot"" vanish, these strings sound fantastic on my electric guitars. They seem to sound bright for a longer time than their nickel wound brothers. The frets do not seem to bother me at this point, but if it starts up again, I will be having a few fret jobs done on my arsenal. Now, I only wish I could find a stainless steel string set that sounded better on my acoustic. The brands I have tried, for the acoustic, sound very shallow and weak.",2
2289,Works great!!,2
2290,"Let me first start by mentioning that I've been using a PS-45 for well over a year at home, in the studio, and gigging. It's been great. That was for my acoustic rig. So when I decided I'd start a second board geared towards electric, I decided to go in search of another skb board. I'm big on craigslist, so when I found the PS-55 for half the list price, in great condition, I was sold.

Since then, I have reorganized my acoustic pedals onto the PS-55 and have been using it.

PROS:
Durable - you can knock it around and feel good about your pedals (still be careful, though). It's a quality molded case with good hinges and latches. The handle is a lot more comfortable too.
Versatile - there are quite a few power otpions. You really have to make sure you know your pedal requirements (voltage, current, ac/dc, and espeically polarity), but from there you can basically emulate every wall wart configuration, replacing all of the extra power supplies and batteries. There are even variable pots that enable you to change the output voltage with a screwdriver...
Quiet - every power connector is isolated, so even with noisy outlets you're golden. It basically does the job of a power conditioner.
Cable Runners - all of the power cables can run underneath the board, eliminating the typical mess of cables.
Size - there is plenty of room to throw cables on top of your pedals or even to stack pedals if you have the need.

CONS:
Big - it comes with the territory, but is notably larger than the PS-45. Wheels may be beneficial?
Power Supply Hum - THIS IS NOT IN THE SIGNAL! The hum you will inevidably hear, I believe, is from the transformers in the power supply. Again, it is not in your signal and you will not hear it through your amp.
Power Cord - is short... But, it's detachable, so you could get a bigger one if you wanted.
No Wart Plugs - shouldn't be necessary, but I use a tube preamp that requires 16V, which is not one of the many options. Maybe one or two wall wart plugs would have been helpful?
Power Switch - like the PS-45 this has no power switch. Why?
Price - I paid $150 for a used one... I don't know that I'd be able to spring for $300...

Additionally, the PS-55 offers an onboard preamp and the option for true stereo output. I don't use either of these features, so I cannot comment on them.

Overall, a 5. I can't justify even half a point for the cons. It's such a nice board to use and is so versatile. As my electric board expands, I may opt for a second PS-55, but that is yet to be seen.",2
2291,"really great amp for the money, DSP features make this amp super flexible!  This 9lb amp replaced a 65 lb amp, so my back definitely appreciates it.",2
2292,They ring true and do not go dead as quickly as other brands.,2
2293,"This is a great drum throne! Super heavy duty construction and 5"" of padding on the seat. I'm 6'3""/250lbs. and I feel like I can play all day no problem using this throne. On my old throne, my legs would start cramping/going numb after 20 or 30 minutes of playing. If you want a solid, yet comfortable throne, I highly recommend this one!",2
2294,"I have had these tuners for a few weeks now, and find no fault in them.  I like the design, the utility and the extras like the drawstring bags that come with each tuner.  These tuners work well.  I compared them with a known good tuner, of another make, and they are right on the money.  You can't go wrong with this product or the company, Nordic Essentials; which sent me an e-mail to make sure I was happy with their tuners.  This level of customer service is, sadly, not as common as it once was.  I recommend these tuners, and Nordic Essentials.",2

2300,"Does Monster's cabling really sound better?

I've bought Monster cables for the past quarter century, and I've also followed some of he debate. After all, Monster DOES tend to be pricey. Anyway, several years ago. Engadget reported the possibly apocryphal story of five audiophiles who decided to do a blind test of Monster's cabling. They rigged up one speaker system with Monster. They used coat hangars to wire up a comparison system. They couldn't hear any difference.

That's the level this debate has sunk to. Let's cut to the chase. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is a five-star instrument cable in terms of its design, construction, and overall performance and durability. Honestly, can you really find anything that you know to be better? I can't (although I know that some people would insist that Evidence and Zaolla are better).

But this is a performance-grade cable. Maybe you don't need performance-grade. My girlfriend got this a year ago, and it has seen very light duty with a Takamine acoustic electric and a $159 Pignose amp. But no public performances. Monster also has $30 instrument cables. These would have suited her circumstances just as well.

By ""performance-grade"", I mean this: you have a two-night gig in Yankee Stadium, stand to pull in a $35 million gate, and want absolutely no equipment surprises. That's when you spend $30 more for performance-grade. For those playing conditions, you get some real pluses with this cable:

1. The materials and construction are extremely sturdy and can easily survive a lot of equipment set-ups and tear downs. If you're performing on the road, you want that.

2. This cable is well-shielded. So are others, but you may not want to take any chances if you're on stage with a band and cables are snaking across each other and crosstalk is a real possibility. You may also want to make sure that your supersized Fender speaker magnets aren't affecting a nearby cable. That's when you want shielding. Playing alone in your living room doesn't require such precautions.

3. The overall bandwidth and transient handling of Monster's cables is undisputed. If you're playing tame folk tunes for yourself, you won't care. If you have complicated lead guitar riffs with a broad frequency range and lots of amplitude spiking (think ""heavy metal""), then you want any distortion to come from your guitar and not your cabling.

This instrument also has about the nicest looking plugs I've ever seen, with their gold and wood trim. They scream ""professional.""

If you play in a band and perform publicly, get this cable. If you don't, one of Monster's less expensive cables should do.

I hope this helps.",2

2303,"Just purchased an used 2001 Seagull S6 cedar top guitar about a week ago at a local music store.  The condition was quite used cosmetically but still in fairly decent shape tone wise and the price was right.  I noticed the saddle was in pretty bad shape with all 6 strings dug deep grooves into it.  I ordered the PQ-9280-CO saddle based on the measurement in the product description.  I was told the shipment would arrive in two days but happily got it in one day :) The replacement saddle dropped in the slot perfectly without any sanding required. The action seemed to be nice with the slightly higher saddle without any sanding down.  I adjusted a little on the truss rod & will play it for a few days before deciding if sanding down is necessary.  I was just amazed the new saddle dropped in the slot perfectly.  If you have a Seagull S6, this saddle is for you.  It sounds good to me :)

3/29/18 Update .. I went ahead and sanded the saddle down to the old saddle height ... adjusted the truss rod a little and it is great now :) very happy with this purchase :)",2

It is really nice to have to practice with especially with my household which is a small house and the violin tends to irritate people sometimes.  I am a beginner so the sounds I create sometimes will make your ears bleed but with this mute they tend to bleed a little less.  The one thing I wish and this is a minor gripe and its merely I wish it would quiet the violin even more than it currently does.  Other than that it does its job like it should even though I wish it could be more muted.,2

One other problem to note is the fact that if one side is powered off for too long, the other side will turn off too. Supposed to be ""power saving"" but could be a problem",2
2319,Works great.,2
2320,Outstanding Lil Uke. I was so surprised to find this on my doorstep today. I ordered this on April 5 and my delivery was due between April 20 and May 5 Super Service!!.Now on to the details.. This little beauty is fantastic in construction and sound its a beautiful mahogany laminate that's flawless in its application and the sound both ac oustic and amped is wonderful (yes it comes with batteries as did the tenor I ordered prior) it's got such a sweet jingle jangle response the action is perfect to me and the frets a fitted to a tee Now I know I'm writing this having only had it for twenty minutes but that's how excited I am! I'll get back to you as I give this piece a thorough tour This is a great add to my Uke stable So pleased! I think this is the best deal out there for a Uke you can grow with!,2
2321,"I just received my Hohner Rocket harmonica yesterday in the mail.  It is quickly becoming my favorite harmonica to take with me whenever I travel.  The harmonica in its zippered case easily fits into my pocket.  That's why I call it my Pocket Rocket.

If you want a great harmonica to go with you and sound great, this is the best way to have both.",2
2322,Nice solution for powering multiple 9v effects pedals with one plug.  The included caps for unused plugs is a nice touch.  My only wish is that there was a couple more inches in between plugs.,2
2323,Allows me to use a small electric driver to assemble my drums.,2
2324,I prefer these. They stay in tune after lots of playing and bending.,2
2325,I bought this because I wanted to apply less pressure when using a capo on my electric.  This is very adjustable and helps to keep from from pulling out of tune too much.  Definitely recommend.,2
2326,"This review is for the Heavy gauge set. I play 1/2 step down (Eb) tuning, and for that these strings are phenomenal. The tension is right, and the sound is FAT and ENORMOUS. I play a McPherson, and McPherson recommends mediums for their guitars. For 1/2 step down tuning, these heavies provide about the same overall tension, which is important for the McPerson tone. I found out the hard way, waiting far too long to make the change.",2
2327,good cradle,2
2328,ok,2
2329,"These are good guitars stands. They work fine, were easy to assemble. Could pay 2 or 3 times more at the stores...",2
2330,"works perfectly with my boss gt 1 does what its made to do not really much you can say, the switches are smooth the unit is constructed very well",2
2331,Works great for my mandolin homie! Now i can jam some crazy folk music or bluesy rock while standing up and dancing about and such! It's the comfiest yo! Totally dope purchase.,2
2332,"These strings sound very nice on my Cordoba C7 CE.  They have that nice Spanish guitar sound that I like.  I would say that the tension is Medium.  The nylon trebles have a mellow tone with just a touch of brightness. The 5th and 6th strings do produce some finger squeeks.  But, most wound strings do anyway.  So, I guess I can't complain.  The ball ends make it so much easier to change strings.  I am happy with these strings.  I bought 4 packages",2
2333,very nice,2
2334,love it!,2
2335,"Good quality springs but I noticed they are a little too long. I used these to put a humbucker in a strat pickguard and the pickup sat too low. I had to cut about 1/4"" of the spring off with a pair of string clippers. After that, they worked fine. No big deal.",2
2336,Won't get a better guitar for the price.,2
2337,Nice and cheap supply with no problems,2
2338,"Boss products have proven solid & dependable in my experience.  This tuner is no different.  Extremely accurate and versatile as both a tuner and metronome.  Works for bass & guitar whether plugged in or not (most accurate with the cable run).  Purchased it for my son to use with his bass and he loves it.  It has both a visual signal and/or audible chirp when your instrument is in tune which is really nice.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the battery compartment cover has a tendency to fall off with even nominal impact.  This is easily countered by taping the cover on at each battery change, but I think that looks cheap and a functioning battery cover is essential to the fit and finish of a quality product from a company such as boss and should be a given.  Battery life is fine and the product is feature laden with an easy to read display.  Shame on boss for the loose battery cover, kudos on everything else.",2
2339,AAAAAA+++++ Great to do business with!,2
2340,"when about these I was not expecting much, but they're fantastic, and have lasted years",2
2341,Works great for the purpose of reducing wind noise. Although it should be remember than a proficient singer or standup comic can use the wind noise sometimes to good effect if they know what they're doing.,2
2342,"It's a screw, but the correct ones for your needs. Not a cheap rip off.",2
2343,It works for me.,2
2344,this snare head sounds amazing on my mapex maple snare! I love the sound of it and how it holds up to periods of playing. great snare head for a good price! I would buy again! and I recommend it to anyone! buy it!,2
2345,"Saw these at my local music shop around last Christmas but didn't have the money for them at the time. Ordered them now with the Freddy ones, and the DANGER Planet Waves strap. Great little set to give to my Fiance for Christmas, a horror film fanatic and guitar player.",2
2346,As advertised. Holds my vintage guitar like a champ. No set-up required.,2
2347,Product was delivered quickly and sounds good on my Fender Jazz Bass.,2
2348,great resonate head with a nice tone and full body sound that brings life to my toms.,2
2349,I have been looking for an instrument chord that can be plugged and unplugged quietly for a long time.  This is the one....excellent in quality and a great buy as well.,2
2350,I have studio in my bedroom that also serves and my workshop and my business office. The ability of this stand to fold out of the way so easily makes it perfect for my use. I generally have it up near the wall and just swing the boom over so I can record at my desk. The chord management also helps so I can leave my mic wired and stowed.,2
2351,Great still learning it though as we speak!,2
2352,"This has been my all time favorite kick drum head. Perfect amount of body, punch and not too much slap. It's great for the punk and ska music I play. If you're into metal or the like, go with the emad. That has more attack but at the cost of the low boomy depth the SKII has. Also you don't need to use any extra muffling or pillows because of the internal floating ring it has.",2
2353,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player.",2
2354,The only problem is there is no way to switch phases without touching the device. otherwise hours and hours of entertainment.,2
2355,"The tones of this recorder is gentle enough to not to annoy my dog. Originally I worried if the size of my hands would be able to play the instrument but after some practices I was able to get my little finger to cover the 4th hole of the RHS. However, at the beginning the notes above higher G's were simply impossible to be played. With a lot of practices I was then able to play two full octaves on this recorder. It's just harder to play then YRA-312B, YRA-314B or Aulos-509b.",2
2356,"Musical instruments are a huge investment. Straplocks allow the guitar or bass to be securely held. They are inexpensive. They do not change the look of the instrument. Not to mention, they are easy to install. They just work. I high recommend them.",2
2357,"Tried one solo speaker to use as my Roland drum amplifier/speaker and found the bass not quite as deep and hard kicking as I wanted even when using in the ""Club"" mode which boosts the bass. When using this with my Behringer powered 12"" subwoofer, it sounds great. However, the whole idea was to get one speaker that could impress as a portable high-end/subwoofer combo and I assumed a 15"" woofer would do the job . Regardless, it's a nice looking and sounding speaker overall but its a bit cumbersome to carry around easily and I'm a fairly big guy. It's definitely a big box and rather heavy though it's marketed as lightweight - not so much. My little Roland cube monitor (30 watts of really sweet sounding highs and mids) teamed up with the Behringer subwoofer sounds better than this speaker for the drums and is probably a little easier to move about. Maybe I already have a nice set-up but I keep thinking the grass is greener...

FYI - this was only intended for electronic drums (new Roland portable kit) but I assume it would sound great for PA use, especially with subwoofers if you use low frequency instruments like bass guitar, keyboards and drums. If I were buying this for PA use, I would probably go with the 12"" version (assuming you have subs) as the price is lower, weight is less and I assume the high end horn is just as loud. For acoustic acts, this is ideal. PS before I returned this I tried my bass guitar through it and it really gets loud and clear but still lacks the really deep bass but is way louder than my Roland/Behringer combo when used with bass guitar. I also plugged the drums into a Mackie mixer, then into the EV and boosted just the sub frequency (63 hz) on the Mackie and EV just got distorted at the low end. Obviously you need subs with this if you want real floor shaking low bass.",2
2358,The bow arrived quickly and I thought is good quality for the price.,2
2359,"Great sound & durable quality, installed on a piccolo snare drum!",2
2360,I ordered 2 bodies because I had several necks I needed to get rid of. First body is free of blemishes and marks and the grain is smooth and even but the second has a few knots and dark patches. These bodies do need a lot of work but if you're good they are worth the money.,2
2361,"Even the Ernie Balls can't hold a candle to these for me. Bought new guitar actually several of late and thought I'd give their strings some use, not D'Addario's. I'm an old very old school heavy strumming some picking player. I destroy in most cases fret buzz etc. But the 10/46 XL work great great sound, though they sing forever, once you strike a note just try to get them to stop. My strat and es339 just sings, still trying to get the amp to accept these is another story. Even the base will blow you out of the area. For a lead player you can bend these off the fret board and they stay in tune, once broken and stretched.",2
2362,Good quality bass for the price. Lightweight and nice finish. Solid construction and very nice tone. Customer service was excellent as well- delivered quickly and the seller responded to my questions promptly and was very nice.,2
2363,Delivery on time fit perfectly no problem you just can't force them on not made as well as the original one's,2
2364,Great.,2
2365,"I got these by mistake when ordering, these 80/20 will be my strings from now on, on my seagull entourage. They make this guitar even more amazing, as they make it much louder and very distinct sound.",2

2370,Macho heavy duty bass bridges just arrived. I can tell you before they are mounted that at this price I am pleased and will mount these in my cigar box guitar bass and they will perform admirably. The fact that they are thick and adjustable will increase the flexibility of tone I can achieve with much effort.,2
2371,"Great strings,  love the nylon",2
2372,"Priced to sell, the integrated strap locks are a winner. I can't give it 5 stars because I'm a fan of leather straps (nylon slides around too easily). Bought this as a spare for when a friend plays my guitar since my leather strap isn't easily adjusted to length.",2
2373,"D'Addario's NYXL1046 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings, I have the Light, are THE best! I've got them on my Fender Strat. I can tune my guitar and play it for a couple hours and still not have it go out of tune. Even if I'm using the tremolo bar and bending strings these things stay in tune. When I get together with other guitar players to jam I don't have to worry about being the one who has to keep tuning my guitar. A couple Ernie Ball die hards are about ready to jump ship and get on the D'Addario Line after seeing mine in action.

I can put my Strat aside, pick it up to play a few days later and it's still in tune. Doesn't happen when I pick up my other electric that don't have these strings on it yet. Either I'm going to have to put these on my other electric or the Fender is going to be my baby who gets all the play time with Mama.

I've never used strings that bend so well. And they don't cut into my fingers as much when playing for extended periods of time. These are miracle strings in my mind.

Most importantly, they sound GREAT!

Good going D'Addario!",2
2374,No issues running lights on this cable.,2
2375,"Buying additional Uke from this company. Solid tuners, material, and craftsmanship. Just a bit plinky on tone, but seriously, an unbelievable buy. Better than many Ukes twice the price! Ships from Asia, so allow yourself about 2 weeks.",2
2376,Arrived on time looks and it is very nice quality for the price. The cover comes off easily but not sure if it's supposed to do that. Have not tested the sound yet but I will update it at a later time. UPDATE: the sound is pretty bright for a pickup of this price and it gets the job done.,2
2377,Great strings!,2
2378,"Just what I needed.... I'm in the habit of rescuing cheap guitars with straight necks and good bodies, and upgrading everything on them to make them really sing.  These nute were for a couple of First Act dumpster queens I found, and they fit perfectly.  Yes, the slots are a little shallow but they're certainly deep enough that while filing them further you won't skip out of the channel.  Definitely a good buy.",2
2379,very nice item,2

2381,"A couple of years ago, I made the switch from the old paper binder to my iPad for lyrics and chord sheets. As a guitarist, it was difficult to scroll or turn a page in the middle of a song. I had looked at wireless page turners for quite a while before I settled on the Cicada. I have used it for several months now, it in a variety of settings and it works very well. I can turn a page either forward or backwards without taking a hand off of the guitar. It's great!",2

2384,great stand......its not as heavy as I anticipated.....durable easy to set up and break down.,2
2385,"I replaced my 12 to 53's (also Elixir) with these custom lights and simply love them.  I basically went to a lighter string for comfort, more than anything else.  I think I've tried every string made (maybe a slight exaggeration), and have no desire to further experiment.  Simply put . . . these work!  As with all Elixir polyweb strings they have a tendency to look a bit worn or tattered as you use them over a period of time, however, they keep their tone, reduce squeak and are comfortable to use for acoustic guitars.  They do last!  I currently use these on a Rainsong, which is carbon fiber and has a tendency to amplify string squeak due to the guitar construction.  Being a loud guitar to being with, you lose little volume (if any) going from 12 - 53's volume wise.

I also used Elixirs on my Gibson SJ-200 and Southern Jumbo (12 -53's) and would never Considered anything else.",2
2386,"This one and the A7515 one together fit my 2017 Epiphone Limited Edition Les Paul Traditional PRO perfectly, and they look great!",2

2405,"First of all, don't expect any new tuner to work as a ""drop-in"" replacement.  Drop-in replacements for tuners basically don't exist unless you have the exact type of tuner, and in that case, you aren't doing an ""upgrade"".  You'll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer.  Or, if there's a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby, have a tech do the work for you.

These tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive, with a nice vintage look.  They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele.  Unfortunately, my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock, which meant that the low E string's tuner was too large - the wing for the screw hung over the edge.  Therefore, I will not be installing these on my guitar, but that is not the fault of the tuner.

Functionally, these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate, and I've heard the hold tune just fine.  Check the back of your headstock for fit, but if that's a ""go"", these are a great option!",2
2406,Does the job of winding and unwinding my uke strings. That's enough for me.,2
2407,"I am replacing an 8 year old Behringer PMP2000, and look forward to getting some time on the X2222USB mixer. I will use it for recording, band rehearsals and for indoor and out door venues.
First thing I noticed is how quiet the X2222USB is, which might have something to do with having an external power amp, but it really sounds good. The pads and sliders all feel good and the overall layout is easy to navigate. I imagine it will sound even sweeter with an outboard EQ, but no complaints so far.  Only drawback is using AUX sends for monitors, which is taking some re-thinking.
 The playback volume CD player and headphone volumes are a bit confusing and the manual is vague on these controls but they all sound really good when the correct sequence of buttons are pushed.
 The USB feature allows for or 2 channel live recording but I am using a ZOOM R16 for 8 channel recording but it is very useful for live demos or capturing song ideas.
 I do wish there was a better manual to understand the switches and pads, but I am working through all of this and so far the X2222USB mixer more than meets my expectations.",2
2408,"A light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar. Good material, good zippers, good design. There are much more well padded soft and hard cases available but they take up a lot more room around the house when not in use.

2409,"This gizmo is smaller than I thought it would be.  I clipped it to the headstock of my acoustic guitar and I found that it's extremely easy to use.  In fact, it can't get any easier than this. I ""swivels"" so that you can angle it to where it's easy to see.  But for me, it didn't work perfectly on my first use.  Even though I tuned each string perfectly (according to this device), I still found that a couple of strings were slightly out of tune.  I ended up tuning those strings ""by ear"".  I can tune a guitar by ear in less than a minute.  But whenever I do that, I can never be sure if it's tuned to the proper key. Now that I am using this tuner, I know that my guitar will be tuned properly (with some tweaks on my part).  This tuner came with instructions and a battery that was already installed.  Plus an EXTRA battery was included.  Can you believe it?  An extra battery is included.  Maybe our world isn't falling apart after all.",2

UPDATE: After having this boom pole for a few years (2 I think) The gold connector that connects the shock mount to the boom pole has stripped, rendering it useless. I have contacted Rode because I cannot find another connector anywhere online so I am going to see if I can at least purchase just that part instead of another boom pole. I will update after I have the answer.

UPDATE II: I was able to get in touch with RODE and I must say they are one of the BEST companies I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I asked them about purchasing the connector and they asked for my address and sent a new one for FREE. No shipping, no charge at all. They said 7-10 business days and I had my replacement part in about 4 or 5 which REALLY impressed me. If nothing else get this boom pole just for the excellent quality, affordable price and UNBEATABLE customer service. I will now by a RODE customer for life!!!",2
2415,good when you don't have an amp,2
2416,This is a great wireless for my guitar!,2
2417,"Really disappointed. Looks very cool but not worth the effort and definitely not worth $50 bucks. I would value it at $10 bucks.  LED light did not work. Directions call for a 3"" hole for the speaker. 3"" is too big. Does not leave enough room for speaker mounting bolts. Speaker Hole should be 2 1/2"". (you can see in my picture the mounting bolts overlap the into the speaker hole)
The chrome corner box trim pieces prevent access to the inside of the cigar box. I left them off. You will have to remove them every time you change batteries.
Before I installed the electronics, I spent a lot of time antiquing and relicing this cigar box. Added a handle. Changed the knob. Painted the speaker grill. I even upgraded the speaker. In retrospect. I would not have wasted my time.
I have a Danelectro HomeyTone mini transistor amp (i paid $19 bucks for) that puts this Cigar Box amp to shame. About all I can say is the Cigar Box amp looks good sitting on the shelf. I doubt I will ever use it.
EDIT 7/25/2017:  After some time and occasional use, I have changed my mind about this amps quality of sound. With the ""upgraded speaker"" I added, the sound has grown on me. It is not very loud but it does deliver kind of a nice vintage crunchy distorted sound. I have come to very much like this amp. My initial review was to harsh. If you like quirky out of the ordinary ""stuff"" this amp is pretty cool. I changed my star rating to a 4 from the initial ONE1 i had posted.",2

2424,"First thing's first: this isn't a normal Big Muff Pi, but instead a kind of second cousin twice removed. The classic Muff sound is a scooped, shimmering, thunderous wall of fuzz that radiates and has endless sustain and layers of thickness. But the Germanium 4 is different - it's really 2.5 pedals in one (overdrive and distortion, and the two together, which I'll count as half) - and the NOS germanium transistors that EHX sourced provide a much more musical, nuanced, flexible, softer wall of sound than the classic Muff. But the sounds are there, and they are fantastic.

Both sides, OD and Distortion, are hugely flexible and usable. They are also really sensitive to the individual guitar - single coils will get a much different reaction than humbuckers. The OD can go from a clean boost to a really thick, gritty overdrive, and the bias control allows you to control compression, aggression, and overall sweetness. The pedal's lone tone control is on the OD side, and goes from fairly bass-thick at 0 to a strong treble boost at 10.

The distortion is great, very very thick but also translucent to some degree - the inherent guitar tone is always heard somewhere underneath the noise. The voltage control - easily the most interesting thing about the pedal - is amazing, as it simulates a dying battery, going from 9v (normal) down to 3v (choppy, sputtery, choking, lo-fi, saggy, super intriguing). The bias control is also very interactive here, just like on the OD side - from edgy and aggressive at 10 all the way to mellow, compressed, and transparent at 0. Everything interacts with each other to a large degree, so it pays to sit and play with the knobs for a few hours to find what you like.

And then there are the two channels together, which is anywhere from thicker, flickering grunge (low gain on both channels), to a raucous fuzz-like tearing distortion with hair everywhere (mid-to-high gain), to endless sustaining wall of musical white noise (everything dimed). Surprisingly useful, and pleasing to the ear - I can't remember the last time I so enjoyed a distortion or OD pedal completely dimed out. Usually the results are muddy, indistinct, ugly ... but the four germanium transistors work their magic.

Also interesting is playing with the amp settings once you have the Germanium 4 settings down. It's fun to add overdrive or distortion to an already distorted channel and see what weird things you can conjure up.

This pedal is capable of both luscious sonic experiments, but also really great straight-ahead vintage blues and rock tones of surprising richness, and also modern indie or shoegazer walls of distorted rhythm guitar. Very versatile, highly recommended.",2
2425,"i'm an Ernie Ball fan & won't deny it. a Mgr. fella' at a local Ken Stanton retail store recommend these awhile back when they first came out and boy was i ever pleasantly surprised! the gentleman's a player himself (in his own band, does studio production &c.) & he was pretty enthused about these suckers so i splurged & gave 'em a whirl. WOW! after slappin' these on my MIJ, mid-late 80's model, Fender Squire Strat., & plugging in, i was blown away. i really really like the way these feel and after plenty of pretty hard playing/ use, these hold up terrific. sure, they're not cheap (comparatively speaking) but i think D'Addario have made one helluva' splash in the ""high-end"" string market share w/ this offering. i prefer the 11-52's and despite the sticker price, i definitely do feel like they're worth every penny given the longevity you'll likely enjoy w/ these like i do. these have quickly become a favorite of mine. i'm a ""hobbyist"" player but i do play quite a bit (13 yrs. & counting); though not a seasoned pro by any stretch i have, over the years, experimented w/ just about every brand of strings available at least once. besides my ""Balls"", these are best!",2

2427,Great stand! Folds down great. Sturdy. Electric and Acoustic on this - no problems! Fantastic buy!,2
2428,"Come quickly, and it's a great tuner. I'm amazed with the technology you can get nowadays for this great price.",2
2429,"I've been working on my own guitars for 30 years and always relied on a folded towel to support the neck and headstock while changing strings, cleaning, repair, etc. This handy little tripod is so much better for working - it features a compact folding style, supporting strength that only a triangle design offers, and a no slip material on the legs to keep your precious axes from taking a tumble. 5 stars all day long!",2
2430,"i bought a white one 9 years ago and still love it and use it today, great shielding no noise and it looks killer and doesnt tangle and the right angle connector is low profile and doesnt get in the way even when plugged into strats its the perfect cable and has been used a lot and still works like the day i got it. great for bedrooms and small spaces too, it seemed expensive at the time but the cable was very cheap considering how long ive had it, high quality and rugged build quality the white is more dirty now and the gold has largely scratched off the connectors but still works like new even after all the abuse its been through. my go to cable",2
2431,"Great strap, love the smell of leather.grafics are cool.",2
2432,These patch cables are kind of cheap and cheesy looking.  But they Do the Job and there is no additional noise,2

2434,Awesome very easy assembley,2
2435,"The plugs are different (smaller and lighter) than the ones used on the GLS cables. They also come with two different cable clamps that you can switch around, depending on the size of the cable that you're using.  A nice touch.",2

Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thak you very much!",2

2439,"i Have two (2) Firewire interfaces. I wanted to be able to use my PC Laptop to record my band and music. Well the only laptop that has firewire is, ""Apple"".  Well I saw that Behringer had a small USB mixer. (Xenyx 302USB) with 5 inputs. Mcrophone XLR/ 1/4"" input.  A line in (RCA) and a 2 track input (RCA). Main Mix output also (RCA). 1/8 jack headphone with a Volume control. The main mix has it's own volume control also.

You have a gain control for the microphone input plus  Pan & EQ. The line input has a volume control also with Pan & EQ  There are two switches one for line in or computer in. Second switch is to select Headphone or main mix.

I Just hooked it to the computer and it loads the driver software.  Comes with a power supply, but it will power up by the computers USB cable. Went on line to Behringer.com and clicked on support, then Xenyx and down loaded the software for Audacity.

Hooked my MP3 player to it by the line input, Recorded, and saved to a MP3 file. Sample and easy.",2
2440,"Works perfect, plus it's so small and light!",2
2441,Good for my acoustic guitar,2

2443,"For a starter guitar, this little axe is pretty darned good! I've got a little trouble keeping it in tune but that's nothing a new nut and a new set of tuners can't fix. I love the simplicity of this LP Special II. It's lighter than an actual LP so I can play it for longer (I like to play standing up, even when just practicing). The tone sounds great. I LOVE the color (I named her Sunny). No issues with the paint job and everything fits together quite nicely. I can't tell y'all how happy I am that I decided to pull the trigger on this purchase!",2

2449,Be warned: using these will turn you into a rockstar,2
2450,"I have been starting to play banjo at home.  We have an open floor plan and the acoustics is optimal for a concert.  However, the sound of my Banjo with Tone Ring and Resonator is quite loud.
The sound of the banjo projects throughout the house.  Getting complaints from the wife and daughter has lead to me resorting to desperate measures.  1) I bought an open back banjo 2) I bought one of these mutes.

I read the reviews, and based upon what I read, it was what my house needed.  This is a brass U-shaped frame with nylon bristles.  Because it is OPEN on one side, it has to be placed with the curved end upwards.  The bristles will hold it to some degree.

If you notice a light or loose fit, then clamp down on it more.  I noticed that my Brass Mute was still pretty loose for a fit, so I placed it under a carpet/rug and pressed down upon the hinge which gave a more snug fit.

The volume is reduced by 1/3.  Overall, I am happy to have purchased this.  On my open back banjo, I place a sock or knee brace inside the pot against the rod, and it mutes the banjo a bit more. The combination of the two allow me to use my picks as opposed to strumming with just my fingers.

Very good item, but Mike's Banjo Mute works better since the assembly screws onto the strings and bridge.",2
2451,Excellent product and seller. Highly recommended.,2
2452,"This sound is an acquired taste- rather messy and hard to control until you get used to it, and it obliterates the sound of the guitar itself- but it is unique, and I dig it for certain kinds of single-note melodic playing. It will not substitute for other types of drive pedals, but I like having it as an occasional extra color. After some experimentation I find that this guy actually works best when you use it to boost a tube circuit that's a bit overdriven already- which is the context it was originally designed for, when you think about it. The tone is much more pleasing, and you get the sustain you want without having to turn the Muff sustain control up too much, which is where you the get the messiness.  It won't do everything, but it does its own thing really well.",2
2453,"I was tied between purchasing the Yamaha-P35 and the Yamaha-P105. I bought the P35. I'm glad I did! It was almost $200 cheaper since Amazon graciously applied a $45 promotional credit. I knew both pianos sounded great, having tried them out at the local music store. The two biggest drawbacks against the P35 were that it didn't accept the full 3 piano pedals (only 1 - the sustain pedal) and that it had a much lower polyphony count. As a 22 year old beginner piano student, I concluded that when my skill level reached the point where these considerations would matter, I could trade in my P35 and buy a better piano or not bother. This piano truly is an affordable and well-made instrument to last a serious beginner student for years. Full 88 keys, weighted - perfect - and I would never buy anything less. I mean, let's face it many beginner students don't stick with the instrument long enough to warrant a more expensive purchase, but it's absolutely essential to get a serious instrument. Yamaha is a great brand. The piano fits inside my bedroom, without fuss. It's light and convenient - a great purchase.

Update:
It's been over a year since I bought my Yamaha P35. Since that time, I've become a better student, playing more intermediate pieces. I've spent many hours practicing on my Yamaha and I still find it satisfying to play and capable for me to practice new techniques. While speakers could be stronger, for the money, this piano was a good choice. A few months ago, I was interested in buying an acoustic - I was shocked at how much I had to spend in a showroom to get an acoustic of equivalent or better touch and sound quality as the yamaha p35. This keyboard is a good value. And, it works just like it did on the first day I bought it - great. I expect to play it for years to come as I continue to improve.

2nd Update (June 2017):
Wow. I can't believe it's been 4 years since I bought this piano. And, it still works great, as I continue to practice intermediate pieces, such as, Claire de Lune, Moonlight Sonata 1st Movement, and Sonata Pathetique 2nd Movement. In a few years, I see myself buying a high quality acoustic but, in the meantime, I'm progressing just fine on the yamaha, with plenty of room to grow.",2
2454,Great picks..especially for playing guitar!,2
2455,They Work Great for polishing Frets!,2
2456,"Love it! Slap it on, tune it up, and slip the appropriate ring in. That's it! No more fighting to get the right amount of deadening. This head sounds GREAT!",2

2458,arrived as described,2
2459,"It's a rubber thing that holds guitar picks and clips to a mic stand.  It's simple and that is probably what makes it great.  It holds the picks just tight enough so that you can grab one out with ease, though they would fall out pretty easy from slight bumping.  Because of the way the rubber grabs a stand, the thicker the stand the tighter it holds the picks.",2
2460,"Nice product, precut and all .., what's not to like?",2
2461,i love this guitar its a little difficult to calibrate but once you get it its awesome best guitar ive had,2
2462,"I pick a lot when I play the bass (fast, rock stuff) and these are perfect! They bend just the right amount so I don't make any loud plucking sounds while playing. They really grip too. Short of using superglue on your fingers, these definitely do what say they do!",2
2463,I love these strings & will order them again!,2
2464,"this mixer sounds awesome! I use it for 2 voices and an acoustic guitar. The fx is great for voice but not so much for the guitar, but it saves you the effort of using separate effects. I recomend it to everyone who is looking for a cheap option with usb and effects. really great!",2
2465,"I received them before due. Packed well, an I'm pleased with my purchase. So buy in faith.  SW",2
2466,Fantastic stand. Works like a charm on several of my guitars.,2
2467,"Works good, and is easy to use ,and very portable.",2
2468,Works great for my daughter,2
2469,Nice microphone and holder. The stand is not Grammy Awards quality but well worth the price.,2
2470,"It took a while to get here due to a stumble and lurch caper with USPS, how ever I have it now and it is quite nice
not a $100 k Tourte but would have gone over well in the day
It is straight and has a proper camber ...Draw to straight is a little over 1000 grams which is on the stiff side (Good wood), which is what I like.
It weighs 68.3 grams and here are no problems with the balance point

The hair took rosin quickly (not always the case) I did some Helmholtz bowing and no hairs broke...typical of a first class hairing job
Based on the one I received I would buy another one! ...and call it a nice utility bow",2
2471,Great stands! They are thick and feel very sturdy. They have a nice ratcheting system to go up and an air damper to slow the drop of speakers but you still need to hold your hand underneath to support some of the weight.,2
2472,This is a great value in an acoustic guitar stand (I use wall mounts for our electrics)  Surprisingly sturdy and dirt cheap too.  These work great for storing a kitebaord as well.,2
2473,These are much softer than my old strings and feel so much better. I'm ordering these from now on.,2
2474,could use a longer neck,2
2475,Great product at Great Price.  Love the add on option from Amazon as I do not have a music store locally. I will use the option as I can.,2
2476,im loving this case a lot i put in my two needles and they fit perfect side by side. the case protects them with no problems.,2
2477,Great Resonator guitar for a beginner. Good tone which is not lost when amplified. A Great buy for the economical price.,2
2478,Only Reso head that I will use. Great tone.,2
2479,Great side pocket could expand a little more.,2
2480,"I love these strings. I have an old, inexpensive Yamaha guitar (my first, and it is 30 years old) and these make that guitar POP. it's amazing. So smooth, last a long time and sound bright all the time.",2
2481,I cannot believe the sound that comes out of this amp.  It's almost hard to make it sound bad.  Every tone is great.  Regardless of what guitar you plug into it.  I'm adding a few Behringer stomp boxes as I go to mold my tone into a more recognizable style (SRV in particular) but this amp just does it and sounds great doing it.  My only drawback is that I'm wishing I would have gotten the 40.  This could probably gig with the emulated output into the PA system but just to show up to practice it wouldn't be loud enough.  But I genuinely love this amp. I urge you to try one and see for yourself.  And the ability to connect it up to your PC or PC based tablet to tweak settings even more is a big help.,2
2482,"I have about 5 different Snarks and they are hands down the best clip-on tuner out there.  I've had several different brands and they ALL suck compared to the Snarks. Never a problem tracking whatsoever.  The most basic model (this one) is actually the best out of all of them IMO.  I've had to change batteries but they last a good while.  The bright dial is perfect in every setting, it's unobtrusive, and it always works regardless of what you're doing with your volume level.  The only drawback at all is that I wish the spring clamp was a little bit more stiff so as to clamp ""harder""; for example on a standard Tele headstock there's not a lot of real estate for it to grab onto so you may knock it off if you're a spaz (I am).  Gibsons, or any 6-on-a-side headstocks, are perfect.  I never plug into a tuner anymore, this is just so much easier to use.  And cheap!  You could buy 10 of them for the cost of a new BOSS--and unless they've improved the BOSS markedly since the TU-2, they work way better.",2
2483,"I read about JazzTone picks at the Jazz Guitar Forum and ordered a half-dozen in several sizes. This is my favorite, and I'll be ordering a bunch more now that I know that I love it and it makes me sound better.
This pick is fast, and unlike picks with sharp edges, it never 'hangs up' on a string. Also, it doesn't ""clack"" when playing rhythimg the way pointy-headed picks tend do. Very smooth and steady.
It's the smallest pick I've ever tried and that's a big plus for me. It doesn't get in my way and it's easy to hold so that only a bit of the tip shows.
It has a better feel in my hand than, say, a Jazz III does. (I played Jazz IIIs for years and like many things about them.) It's thick without being clunky or slick.
My first thought upon using it was, ""Why haven't these always been around? This is the greatest guitar pick I've ever used!"" (And I've used more kinds than I can recall.)",2
2484,Good strings for 1978 Guild D-25; not much tension for older guitar bridge.,2
2485,thanks,2
2486,Wish I had gotten these speakers 1st. Nice sound and not to bulky.,2
2487,Nice acoustic strings.  The sound nice.,2
2488,"Yes, it's an inexpensive beginner set, which is what I was looking for. My 8-year old son loves it, and I use it with headphones to practice. So far, nothing has failed but we have only had it for a month. I wanted to purchase something to see if drumming was something that my kid would be into, and for me to practice quietly. The sounds are about as realistic as you'd expect (don't expect super-realistic sounds), and the pads are relatively touch-sensitive. It's a fun way to start playing drums.",2
2489,Great pedal quick on response. Rapid speed,2
2490,"Picked one of these up since my wife doesnt want all my guitars hanging on the wall anymore. Upon opening the box, the first word out of my mouth was, Whattt? This thing is like Dewalt decided to build a guitar stand. Easy to put together (no tools or brain needed) and sturdy as hell. My Strat is sad because my LP is resting in one of these...and now Ive had to purchase more of them to make everybody happy.

Seriously, if you need a guitar stand, stop playing around and just buy this one.

Note: the model I received did not have a rubbery finish on the comfort grip (if thats what its called. The handle/grip is of a hard plastic with a metal adjustment lever, not plastic like in all of the one star reviews. Perhaps Hercules has fixed the problem?",2
2491,"It's a mic cable.  Nothing wrong with it, nothing great about it.  Fair price.",2
2492,"I have just about every style of capo known to man.  I haven't been happy with the performance of most - too often during a performance I've had to fiddle with retuning after capoing, or getting halfway through a song only to find that a string was buzzing, etc.

The beauty of this capo is that you set the tension, find the sweet spot, and then you should be good to go, with minor adjustments of the screw, only.  We capo at a few different places in my duo, and I do use two guitars with very different neck profiles, but in my experience this capo is the easiest to adjust and most stable during performances.

The quality seems excellent.  I've used these capos - I have a silver and a gold one - for a little under a year on a number of gigs and for many, many rehearsals and so far they're rock solid.  I never thought I'd love a capo this much, but there it is.",2
2493,Light and sturdy and I don't need to come up with any more words - it's a music stand OK,2
2494,"These are the 4th pair of full-size headphones I've owned, and definite keepers. They have a wonderfully detailed sound with plenty of extension and better soundstage than the Audio Technica headphones I use. Bass is light, but still present - it's easy to adjust to the quieter bass after a few hours of listening.

These are also very easy to wear for hours on end - I use these at work regularly for 3+ hours a day. They come with two pars of earpads (leather and velour), and the adjustable headband is far more comfortable than the padded plastic ones on other headphones I own.

Overall these are excellent headphones for the price, although I'd avoid them if you like heavy bass or if you need headphones on the go (they are bulky).",2
2495,"These strings are dark, and have absolutely incredible punch and tone.  These may feel a bit rough at first but they will win you over.  Be careful putting them on as the normal guarantee doesn't apply to these more exotic strings.  But wow, these are pretty great!",2
2496,"I make my own backing tracks with Band in a box and after I finish finalizing the CD, I simply put the CD in this unit and then make the adjustments necessary. You can change the key and tempo which I find very handy. You can also hook up a microphone to sing into and there is also a headphone jack to listen to yourself as well. I bought the CD version, I believe there is also an MP3 version as well. I am happy with this purchase, I have found this unit to be very helpful. The only negative is the power adapter is not included, (you have to buy it separately) so I just use 4 AA batteries, no big deal.",2
2497,great product,2
2498,Great service and the correct size strings,2
2499,They match the Behringer mic set well. Good quality with solid connectors providing true sound reproduction and heavy enough cables.,2
2500,"Great home practice amp with lots of tones. With the FUSE software you can literally create any amp sound you could want. I honestly think this is THE best beginner / intermediate bedroom practice amp on the market.

- The Fender-y sounds are stunningly good, like I can't believe they sound this good on a modulation amp that costs like $100.

- The stock high gain sounds are average. There are better amps out there for high gain, but I think this one gives you a ton of versatility in exchange.

- Aesthetically, looks great, very lightweight so it's easy to

- Even at just 20W it's more than loud enough for my room. I use some studio headphones to avoid annoying the crap out of everyone around me and it's nice that it has a 3.5mm outlet.

- Has an aux port so you can use it as a semi-portable ipod speaker. Since it's so light it's easy to move around the house wherever you might want some music while you work.

All in all, if you're looking for a practice amp that won't break the bank but gives you tons of sounds I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.",2
2501,"I am a long time guitar player and have a collection of guitars. I own electric, acoustic, classical, bass but have never gotten into ukulele until recently.  After doing a bit of research I decided on the Cordoba 20 TM-CE Acoustic Electric Tenor for my first ukulele.  I am very happy with it.  First off, it is a very nice looking ukulele, with a very solid feel to it.  Nothing on this looks cheaply made.  I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice it looks.  I was really worried because this was the first time I have purchased an instrument online and without having spent some real time playing with it.  Plus, I realized I would be getting an instrument right out of the box without any kind of ""setup"" which is not the ideal way of making a perfect match.  I would recommend always playing an instrument before buying it but I will say that I was lucky and it worked out for me this time.  Admittedly, I am new to the ukulele and there is an adjustment to make from the guitar but so far it has been a pretty easy transition.  I am loving this thing.  The tone is nice and I couldn't be happier.  There is a learning curve with the different tuning/fret size/action and I will probably switch out to a low G string but I am having a blast learning this thing.  There are no strap buttons on this ukulele so if you are one to play with a strap you will have to improvise with that or install one.  There are kits and they are easy to install if you want to wear a strap.  If you are looking for a mid range ukulele, this to me feels like a great bang for your buck.",2
2502,Recommended 100 % excellent product,2
2503,"This sure is the easiest, most non-obtrusive, fastest and most accurate capo on the market - just wish they would make it more heavy duty.
I would pay more money for the extra quality.
Gave it 4 out of 5 stars as one broke when I grabbed it the wrong way. I have 2 left.",2
2504,good,2
2505,"Much better constructed than I would have thought for something marketed for kids.  When you want the sleigh bell sound without it overriding everything else, this is perfect.  The other sleigh bells I have are just too loud sometimes, and this is perfect for an accent piece.",2
2506,"First of all I did not buy this amp through Amazon.  I bought this amp at discount as it was a floor model.  The clean tone versatility surprised me, nearly as clean as my much loved Bugera's.  I found it to be the easiest amp to dial in a particular sound that I've ever used. I also find it to be an ideal combination of size and power, with enough ""in your face"" to satisfy those times when a bit of bite is needed.  I will also note that I've replaced my preamp tubes after a month of ownership.  My gut feeling is this has more to do with the rough treatment this amp was subjected to as a demonstrator and not any quality shortcoming of Laney's.  My other amps were new in box and I gave them a gentle burn-in period as I'm doing now with the new tube set in my Laney.  Buy this amp for its amazing sound and versatility as well as its great form.  But as with all tube amps, respect its needs, give it the care and handling it deserves and you'll be as blown away as I am.  Then come back and write your own revue.",2
2507,Great loop station. Was able to learn how to use it in a couple hours.,2

The effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well. Recommended.",2

2517,"I have probably bought more than 20 replacement pickups in my life. I have replaced OEM BC Rich pickups with Duncans with great results, used DiMarzios in a couple of project guitars, and several other Steinberger (Spirit) projects where I have tried both brands.

This may be my overall favorite pickup for tone, attack, and gain. It has a great thick sound with shimmering highs and clear lows. in my experience, Duncan does not make a ""muddy"" pickup across the line.

This is a clear winner for me. This particular model was used in a Steinberger Spirit at the bridge position to replace the Steinie OEM p'ups. The guitar sounds incredible now. This was mainly bought as a travel guitar, but I find that the Duncan SH4 moves it up to be one of the best sounding guitars that I own. I put 2/3 of a set of Texas special Fender p'ups in the mid and neck positions on this guitar, and it is really a tone machine now.",2

2525,"The Gator Frameworks ID series microphone stand is first class! First of all - it looks great!! Sometimes looks add that extra little bit - when you're on stage people will notice it. The base is solid and heavy enough that  a decent weight mic can be used without fear that the whole thing will capsize while you're in the middle of a song. The shape of the base legs and the main cantilever on the boom are more flat than round. There is less worry that the mic will drop when you move the stand around. To open the base and the extensions on the boom, there is a locking lever rather than a screw mount. It is far more stable. The whole thing folds up for transporting - and an added bonus - not even mentioned in the description, is a very nice padded carrying case for the stand. A very small complaint, it would have been a bit better if the stand could fit in the case with the mic clip attached. It doesn't so you have to unscrew the clip to transport the stand. While an inconvenience, it was not big enough to lower the score - a ""5"" for sure!

I've got numerous mic stands, but this is the one I'm going to use the most.

***** Updated to mention that I bought a second one of these stands and it did NOT come with a case. I originally dropped the score by a point to a ""4"" with the absence of the case, but since the price came down a bit, this stand is really a good value - not cheap, but a very good mic stand!",2

2534,FENDER THIN  MY CHOICE,2
2535,Sound great.,2
2536,"Other reviewers have their own purposes for their purchase.  As for me, it was to practice chords long forgotten and decrease the time between the repositioning of chords.  Tuning the strings is of the least importance as I have a guitar for that purpose.  This device helps me practice in the car while I wait for the return of my wife's darting into stores.",2
2537,Thanks,2
2538,"Great practice sticks,  they are light because they are maple , but seem to work good. For the package price, they are about $1.60  a set, cheaper than any store. A great deal.",2
2539,"I have some already, and they work great I bought these as extra because they tend to get beat up, when using them daily during practice time. great price great buy",2
2540,cool product!,2
2541,"Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.",2
2542,"Easy to erect, strong and uncomplicated.  I like it.",2
2543,I love this stomp box although I never stomp on it :-)  Needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you.  My amplifier doesn't have reverb so I route the effects send to it and leave it on.  It has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldn't think about playing without it...,2
2544,"Based on other reviews, I made my purchase. This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough.

Two downsides, both are about the noise.

1. I live on the 4th floor. As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it. This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live.

2. When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise. (Other than the radio part.)

None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.

By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery.",2
2545,Dad was very happy with them.,2
2546,"Everythink  was ok, thanks a lot.......",2
2547,Very good Humidifier for guitar. Holds the water well and does not drip. Easily installed in your guitar sound hole. Seems to give good humidity inside the body. I like it very much. I will recommend it.,2
2548,"Great strings. Rich, loud tone (a bit bright). Long lasting and the coating makes them smooth to play.",2
2549,"Professional quality classical strings!  I love the sound of these strings!  Sweet, mellow, rich, warm, but also focused and clean.",2
2550,Great sturdy product,2
2551,"Good cable, as good as any expensive brand. Thick, a bit stiff and seems to be shielded. No complaints at all.",2
2552,"Bag has decent padding, heavy duty null. Zippers, comfortable to carry with over the shoulder strap, lot of pockets for storage, large pockets are round like shape of banjo and lesson book doesn't fit

Overall very nice I would buy another",2
2553,This is a core part of my rig and has been for about 5 years. It sounds great and it has tons of settings. I never think man...i wish had paid more for my delay or that i had gotten a different one. it sounds like a delay. what more do you want?,2
2554,Here it is music people keeps your ac lines clean must buy on amazon...,2
2555,Great product. Love that it can be easily stored.,2
2556,"What a great deal.  My daughter plays this one when I play the slightly more expensive yamanah one.  This one is fine for anyone to learn on, I'm in my 30's and just started.",2
2557,This case fits my Iommi sig Epiphone SG perfectly.  It's nicely made and supports the guitar as it should.,2
2558,works fine! No buzzing.,2
2559,thanks! it's wonderful,2
2560,"I bought the warehouse deal model for $108.20 so there was significant savings over the new model.  Overall, the item is in great shape, with only minor scratches and a slight separation of the binding in one area.  It came with a gig bag, truss rod wrench, battery, cable, and pick.  Out of the box, there was some fret buzz on the 2nd fret of the D string, but a slight truss rod adjustment fixed that completely.  Acoustic volume is appropriate for an acoustic bass guitar, and the bound fretboard and fretwork is surprisingly good for a guitar of this price point.  The strings will need to be changed, but that's expected for an inexpensive instrument.  Also expected, the instrument is quite neck heavy, which is typical for this body style.  Through an amp, it works fine, providing a typical piezo pickup sound.  The controls offer tonal variation typical for this type of instrument.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase, assuming the guitar holds up over time.",2
2561,"Yes, they are great to have.",2
2562,Works perfect with steel guitar!!,2
2563,I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating.,2
2564,"I am quite happy with this device.  It does not seem to degrade sound quality.  I use it to run one guitar to three amps - 2 Marshalls, and a Blackstar.

Only knock is, if you use a battery, you must unplug the input.  If you don't, it will kill a 9v battery overnight.  Best to get a standard 9v adapter.

I also have a Morley volume pedal (Steve Vai Little Alligator).  I had some issues with it, but found their customer service to be top-notch.",2
2565,"I used this on a recent MiM body/neck, and it fits good, with a few caveats.  First, it has the truss rod adjustment notch at the heel of the neck, and my neck does not, which isn't a big deal to me, but it might be for you.  Also, recent MiM basses (I don't know which year) have the same size neck pickup as the bridge, which may be slightly larger than the hole here.  I used aftermarket pickups, so no big deal, but I did size it with the stock one (from a 1999), and it was too big.  Also, the color of this is more of the ""brown"" tort, which is what I wanted, but if you're looking for the more ""red"" tort, this is not it.

Lastly, and this is stupid, but this has clear film on it, just like a new bass would, but it doesn't have any stickers on it announcing the make/model/series/etc, so it's not as obvious.  Peel that off carefully, starting at a corner, and you're good to go.",2
2566,"I have the thicker version of this pick, and I wanted just a little more flexibility.

Thankfully, they have these in varied gauges, and here there's some give.

I initially didn't like the thicker one, but these have become my go-to pick for my bass, you know, when I'm not using my fingers.",2
2567,"These turned out to be a bit stiffer than my usual PickBoy .070mm. Nice on acoustic, though.",2
2568,"This Behringer interface works great for recording CD'S from albums.
I use the recording software that came with my laptop (Sonic Stage) because I didn't care for the software that came with this preamp. Just like recording albums to cassettes, it takes time.",2
2569,"Certainly a fine humidifier.  Well made, doesn't drip, fits nicely between strings--with no high bump, does its job.  My only complaint is that these humidifiers don't hold much water.  In fact, since I measure my water precisely, I can say that in my experience this model holds just one-third of the water of an Oasis OH-1 humidifier.",2
2570,"Nice lights for the price easy to use very bright, setup quick  and easy.
I liked this product so much I bought a second set and a Chauvet
Obey 3 DMX controller-a perfect fit for my band.",2
2571,"These are very nice strings. Came right up to pitch and are staying there. Smooth feel and nice tone. Yes, they are stainless not phosphor bronze.",2
2572,"Great light! I have used this many times, works perfectly! Multiple settings for the light, having the 2 lights is great when using an open binder for lyrics? You won't be disappointed!",2
2573,"Yes, it blinks only left to right... or right to left if it's upside down....and if the enclosed IEC power cord is too short for your light pole, invest $10 for a 25' long IEC cable and your problem is solved.  They can be found on ebay or amazon.  The Chauvet LED BANK allows the user to daisy chain power from one unit to another so the light stand only requires one main power cable going up (or down).  The units chase setting via sound is easy to adjust/set and beats to be music far better than the AMERICAN DJ LED COLOR BURST = that thing is a waste of time.  At least the Chauvet won't look ridiculous during a ballad as it will chase to the beat.  The ADJ CB will go through its 17 different chases and looks totally ridiculous during a speech or a ballad- almost as cheesy as a lights on a carnival ride.  The ADJ Colorburst has a ""chase setting, a speed setting, and a sound setting"".  The chase (per customer service) can be set to the different chases, although there are no markings or illustrations on the unit or in the user manual to describe.  Also, the ""sound"" knob also has no markings and gives no explanation of how the chase is designed... except the microphone programs it to bounce from one to another of the 17 random chases.  and the chase designs DO NOT chase to the music... only the switching from one to another... but they go so dang fast it just looks like a bad strobe light.

Find the Chauvet led dj bank being sold on amazon for $50-$65 but no less than $70 on Ebay... and ebay is where my ADJ Colorbursts will end up unless I try to craigslist them first.

Be Happy.",2
2574,Looks original on my Fender cab rebuild,2

2579,"The Hohner Special 20 harmonicas are legendary in their performance. My band (Black Valley Blues Band) uses these harmonicas exclusively and when we added another harmonica player, we needed to replace his harmonicas with the ones we use to keep a consistent sound. This is the best deal we have found anywhere on the internet to get the 5 most commonly used keys in one bundle. You're spending less than $150 for 5 harmonicas that would normally cost you about $40 each.

We had one small issue with our purchase: Two of the harmonicas were missing from the package... likely just a packaging mistake at the factory or something but Amazon quickly remedied the situation and sent us out a new set, this time containing all 5 harmonicas. To complete your set, you'd only need to buy 2 additional harmonicas that aren't included with this set, however, Hohner did leave room in the case to accommodate the last two. They aren't keys you'll really be using much so this set is perfect to get yourself started,

Don't start by buying the cheap harmonicas first because you'll learn to play on sub-par harmonicas and will need to adjust to the Special 20's at some point. Start with the best... these harps are made in Germany and are built to last. Do a Google search for yourself and see what the top harmonica players use: Hohner Special 20's

2581,cool,2
2582,This is proving to be a very satisfactory case.  It is holding 8 harps securely and I only wish that there was a model that would hold harps on both sides so that I could comfortably carry another 7-8 in the same case.,2
2583,Great product and excellent company to buy from because they are affordable and ship fast.,2
2584,"Love the sand grip. Tried other types of grip picks to include the Clayton ""Bee View"", and like these better. The sand is stuck on with glue and does wear off, but by then, the pick is outlived its usefulness.",2
2585,Thanks,2
2586,thanks for such a good product to buy it and I brought it to Quito Ecuador in South America and worked great,2
2587,These come in Handy. Fixed some Amp inputs. Very Inexpensive!,2
2588,"I've had a few interfaces in the past for use with Cakewalk SONAR and X1, etc..  I used to shy away from USB interfaces because I thought firewire was better, as in my FA66 which is Roland's older but comparable model.  When it was time to upgrade I went with this model and am pleased with it's operation, construction and visual appeal.  Probably the best feature of all is the very low latency which is critical when recording during the playback of other tracks.",2

2590,"I love this unit, would I bring in on stage in front of 1,000 people.  No, but for a venue of 100+ it is perfect.  Will it replace my large Bass unit? No,  but for about 90% of what I do it is perfect. Would I love it if I was an old time rock star?  I'm not sure, but for an old time bass player it is perfect.",2
2591,"Got this for a Starcaster, just needed something solid and inexpensive. This one worked great, very solid. No complaints so far.",2

2593,amazeballs,2
2594,Great clips for a beginner and like the fact that they are adjustable.,2
2595,"These things are amazing. Had them for a year or so on my Strat, along with a roller nut, and the guitar never goes far out of tune. As the strings get worn you have to adjust, but with these it's extremely minimal. Once you get them set where you want, you can go a few days without adjusting and they'll stay in the exact same spot. I now put them on every single guitar I get -- electric, acoustic, everything.",2
2596,"These just go on your guitar without having to make ANY changes and they lock in place.

I have the 3"" version and I'm going to order some 2"" versions for a couple of different guitars I have.

I believe you will be very happy with these, I know I love them.",2

2602,LOVE IT! GREAT BUY!!!!,2
2603,"If you're using them strictly to add a tambourine effect while you open and close your hats, they aren't that discernible.  You only really hear them clearly if you're hitting them with a stick, in which case they sound great.  Just be aware that they don't jingle very much just closing your hats.",2
2604,Great value!,2
2605,"I love it as it's light and well balanced. I prefer an off center hold so this fits the bill just right. It was inexpensive and possibly my new favorite, even though it will never produce a lot of sound. It is not, however, very good for triplets if you tend to play many of those.",2
2606,nice and soft. great fit.,2
2607,great deal.,2
2608,For the price this ukelele is just fine.  It stays in tune adequately and has a reasonably good tone.  I use it at school with my kindergarteners.,2

2614,"For whatever reason I like braided cables. I have an old Gibson bass with a 3 coil humbucker on it. This guitar has always had a loud ground hum. I used my new Kirlin cable the other day, wow, no hum. I have only had this a couple of weeks but have been playing for years. These cables seem very substantial and very well built. They include a nice Velcro cable strap too. I will update after a couple of gigs.",2
2615,nice little tool,2
2616,"As mentioned this is not a professional ukulele but definitely perfect to learn on and have around.  Ive had mine for 7 years and it is still in great shape and sounds as good as it did from day one.  Ive since upgraded and own a few ukuleles but Im always grateful for being able to afford and start my ukulele journey with this one.  A friend of mine (newbie) picked it up a couple of weeks ago and loved the way it felt and sounded.

If you are just starting or want to give a newbie a ukulele for lessons, I recommend getting this.  Its affordable and if t turns out the ukulele is not for you, it doesnt leave a sting in your wallet.

I do recommend getting a good tuner such as the Snark and a good set of felt picks.  Enjoy!",2
2617,"Very sturdy. Built well, only took a few moments to put together.",2
2618,"One for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great.  I probably didn't need the 15' length, but at the time, this was the only really good cable with 90* angles.",2
2619,"Works great, but the glossy black makes it so any smudge or finger print is very prominent. Needs new strings, or just break in the ones it has with it for a while and I personally liked them because they were a little thicker than normal uke strings overall. It was my first ukulele and definitely recommended for a beginner to see if you really like playing in order to buy a newer nicer one with better sound. But for what it is and the price, I couldn't ask for anything more.",2
2620,Simply amazing does everything it needs to do A+ ily,2
2621,"This is just what the doctor ordered. I bought three and am purchasing 3 more. All of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders. If I switch one mic to another stand, it could not be easier, just a press of a little button. With different shock mounts on different mics, I don't have to worry about re-threading the mounts each time I change mic stands. The time it saves is also invaluable. No problem with quality control on the 3 I now have, and I have no complaint with the build. Great for the studio, where I use mine, would think It would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand, use a clip for that.

Addendum:

I love these so much, I have bought one for each mic in my locker, and each stand. That's a total of 12. None of them have failed after almost a years worth of use, the best invention for a mic since the shock mount. These will save you time, guaranteed!",2
2622,"What can I say, but that I own several Behringer mixers.  I have one to run my home Part-15 FM radio station, I have two for the Internet remotes I produce, I have another two in my home studio.  I bought over 10 for work.  Rock solid construction, easy to use and VERY EASY on the budget!",2
2623,"cant believe the sound quality im recording with a mic i paid under $5 for just as a test buy for fun, i record acoustic guitar with this mic and my classical acoustic that has no pickup, for the $ you cant lose, now if you looking to make proffessional recordings everyone will tell you spend the money and get top shelf gear, if you like me and just looking to piece togther equipment on a budget i highly would reccommend this",2
2624,"I just needed to free up some space in my small NYC bedroom and I didn't want to spend a bunch of money either. I was concerned about the build quality given the price, but the reviews seemed solid so I gave it a shot.

Some expressed concern over the quality of the drywall anchors. However no one actually mentioned them failing or breaking, so I decided not to replace them. And yes they're cheap, but these mounts feel very solid in the wall and I'm very happy with the purchase.",2

2630,"D'Addario strings.  I've been a fan of there stings for over thirty years.  They make a great product and don't overcharge for it.  The couple of times I had a defective string, they sent a replacement in two days!  No questions asked.",2
2631,"I was expecting a crappy low end 10 watt sound with a pretty Vox facade. I was wrong the tone out of both my Strat and Tele sound great out of this amp. It's got a lot of power and volume.

The bass, treble, and gain controls are simple but give you a lot of room to define your own sound. The gain on the clean channel sounds great. The dirty channel provides a great fuzz tone on its own.

When I want a heavier sound I switch to the clean channel and run my effects through it.

I can recommend this amp for a wide range of styles and tones. Everything from thin Tele or Strats to Gibsons, single coil or humbuckers, and even acoustic-electrics; they'll all work great with this amp.

I've always been a fan of the warm Vox sound and they didn't skimp on this small practice amp. This is definitely an affordable, quality amp you can use for practice and even jamming with a band (it does have that much volume).",2
2632,"IF you never owned one of these they are rather different then your typical distortion/ overdrives out there. The fuzz has very little control and is  way over the top to the point you think its going to fall a part. But the beauty is how well these clean up with your tone knob. you have overdrive at 5 or 7 but then you turn you knob to 10 and you have crazy lead notes that not Boss can give you. Its basically early 70's pink floyd solos that are super full. He diddles around until the solo and then bam, he cranks the volume knob and fills the whole song. The germanium version is a bit smoother if prefer but there is not huge difference between the two. Its cool to have around but its more of specialty pedal unless you only play heavier musics from around 1970. There is a switch inside that can reduce  the gain but you have to be careful, go too low and sounds like the battery is dead.",2
2633,DS-1 as it should be. Just a DS-1. I love it.,2
2634,Not like those cheesy ones. This is a quality high mass padded capo worth the asking price. For up to six string instruments. Sorry the reach is short for a seven or greater string instrument necks. really a find in the sometime disappointing music accessories market space. Very useful for electric guitar setups or as a traditional acoustic guitar performance capo.,2

2637,had to repair a set of speakers.,2
2638,"These are a great upgrade to Squier tuners. For $23, they are well worth the price. In my experience, they hold tune longer than Affinity, Bullet, and Classic Vibe tuners. They turn very smoothly and feel substantially better than stock Squier.

Fitment:
Affinity: These are the same size as Affinity tuners. However, you will have to add a screw for each key. Stock Affinity tuners do not have any screws. They are held in place with tabs that you cannot see when the tuner is on.

Bullet/Class Vibe: the stock tuners are smaller. Therefore, you will have to enlarge the headstock holes to 10mm. Classic vibe tuners are decent so I wouldn't feel the need to upgrade. Bullet tuners are terrible so these would be a good upgrade. Buy a reamer to enlarge holes in the bullet.",2
2639,Great sell.,2
2640,Nice stands for the money.  have bought 4 of them so far.  I do wrap the pre-existing foam with super soft old diaper cloth.... if the guitar rests on the foam covered lower arms for a long period of time it is possible to imprint on the guitar finish - especially guitars with a Nitrocellulose finish.,2
2641,Great price! I bought three and will purchase a couple more. I play out and record with them. I bought the 20 footers.,2
2642,"I had no idea this cloth could work so well. I've used this cloth on a 70's classical guitar, a newer Les Paul, a rosewood Strat, and a vintage J-100, all with remarkable results.

Tear off a strip of this cloth and just wipe your frets lightly at first, I'm betting the cloth looks like a coal mine, mine sure did, especially my PLEK cut LP. I keep tearing off strips and wiping the frets and board until the cloth isn't as grimey, then use a paper towel to wipe off excess oil.

Not only does this cloth seem to fine polish the frets, with just a bit of grain to the cloth (not abrasive), and remove all the grime, but the feeling of the frets afterwards is the true reward. Not greasy, or over-oily. Smooth bends and fast runs. My fretboard's look better now than when they were new. I'm here buying another, is why I'm writing this review.",2
2643,Awesome,2
2644,"Nice.  I can duplicate the intro to Magic Bus flawlessly with these. (What year did that come out, 1968?)  They look nice.  I don't know what else to really say about them.",2
2645,"For the price, I think these are outstanding! I simply use these for private use when I just want to crank up some tunes and play a little but I wouldn't be afraid to use these at a small venue. The sound is decent but for the price, I'm not complaining! Glad I bought the 14's instead of the 13's!",2
2646,The only system you should use for acoustic guitar humidification.,2
2647,"i was hesitate at first. The rings were soft foam and cheap looking plastic. But of course I gave it a try. It fit well, only took about one turn of the key to sound good. Once I fully adjusted it and put a patch on it, it was so much better than my remo that I actually laughed. It has made a huge difference and I don't think I'll ever own a different skin.  I've always had a blanket in use and I no longer need that. 5 stars all day!",2
2648,"Sweet product. Works great, easy to use. Your gonna sing more just to hear how big you sound now. Learn to tap dance, because you'll want to tap B side, then A side as you sing verse, then chorus. Have fun.",2
2649,"What a pedal. A copy of a Line 6 echo pedal, the sound is musical and totally professional.",2
2650,Great,2
2651,"This is very inexpensive strap that performs well.  It is comparable to similar straps from Levy's, Fort Bryan, and Dunlop.",2
2652,Works great with my tenor and soprano ukulele. It folds up abd can fit in the pocket of my gig bag. The only problem is it won't fit when the uke is plugged in. It sits very close to the ground and there's not enough room for the plug.,2
2653,"I was hoping that these would fit in a Music Man amp but alas, it was not to be. They were just *slightly* different, and I guess that was what Music Man had to do to not violate Fender's copyrights. Make it visually more or less indistinguishable, but just different enough to not stimulate a lawsuit.

Comments I can make about these compared to their equivalents 40 years ago though: the metal is thinner in the strap itself, but the part seems well cast and acceptable quality. Similarly, the screws are slightly thinner and seem to be a little less weighty than their vintage cousins but the lock nuts should do their job just as well. This is definitely cheaper than finding vintage spec equipment, and will probably perform the job just as well, so on an amp with terribly rusted or missing parts, this will probably do the trick.

Just not on a Music Man.",2
2654,"Good quality, a little on the bright side for my taste. Found out after I bought these that most prefer the G and C string to the A and D strings. But I liked the string enough that I would like to try the G and C strings.",2
2655,the best,2
2656,"If you don't like too much dirt in your tone, this might be the pedal for you.
The Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally.
If you have a fairly clean single channel amp, it won't give you the full crunch or the
extra sustain specially at low bedroom levels.  However, if you set your tube amp to
where it just starts to break up or is already cooking, step on this pedal and you'll be rewarded. If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp, set the gain low and boost it with this pedal. The notes ring clear with the extra bite, and brightness to cut thru the mix.......sweet! You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesn't color your sound.  (No mid-hump)
I use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive, OCD and the dirt channel on my amp.
The pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made.  It's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives.  Instead of a tone knob, it has a ""focus knob"" which controls your picking dynamics and presence.  All the way to the left, the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp.  All the way to the right, when you pick the strings hard, it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence.  The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.
You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.
This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control.  I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob.  At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after, it's a no brainer.",2
2657,"This item delivers exactly as described.  The tone is wonderful and much better than other options which are only a dollar or so less expensive.  The price can't be beat.  We have both the Soprano and the Alto from the 24 series and I don't see how these can be beat except by instruments costing in the hundreds of dollars.  I highly recommend this product, I would buy it again if needed.",2
2658,"Amazing quality for the money.  Interesting, though, that the shipping comments of a year or two ago still apply.  The boxes were damaged upon arrival, one unit was scratched slightly.  All parts and pieces were there, though, so no action was required.",2
2659,"I have same basic type on all my guitars so one strap fits all with little to no adjustments needed and match the other gold hardware upgrades I've added.

It was ok stock,but now it's all WOW !! Next,my Ibanez EX3700",2
2660,This device rocks.  We use two of them in the band.,2
2661,"Way Cool!!!  Planet Waves does it again - quality and ease of use.  This kit comes with 10 feet of cable and 10 plugs.  Enough to string together 6 pedals (do the math), but where this really shines is not adjacent pedals, although that's cool too, but stringing together pedals across your board that need to go in a certain order but are tricky to place in that order.  Case in point, I have 13 pedals on my board right now... getting ready to be 14+  (I know, overkill, right?) - and my delays, which come after my modulation effects, are across the board from each other.  So, the solution is a custom length cable that works and sounds great - this is the kit for that.

The tips of the 1/4 inch plugs are propriety, in that planet waves developed them to fit snug into the input of a pedal or guitar. I have a 20 foot guitar cable with these tips and it is great.  It is super simple to ""solder-lessy"" attach the cable to the plug/tip.  You simply put the cable into the plug with a screw motion and then clamp it down with the screw (included screwdriver).  It's SO simple.  And, for a guy who doesn't know how to solder very well, this is a HUGE plus.

All in all, this a great and innovative product.  I have never received anything from Planet Waves that isn't profoundly cool.  Totally FIVE stars from me!!!",2
2662,"These are the best strings for my Fender Strat.  playability, tone, bends, just the prefect string for me.",2
2663,"One month later update: I still love this guitar. I am so glad I got it. I also bought a hard case and humidifier. Do yourself a favor and humidify your guitar in the case and keep it there if you're not playing it. My guitar stays in tune so much better because of this. I practice a little bit every day and it is amazing that most days I don't need to do more than a slight tweak to get it in tune.

The sound is beautiful. Because I am a dork, I want more guitars but it's hard to imagine getting a guitar that is much better than this one without paying more than a $1,000!  I think this is an awesome guitar and I would not hesitate to buy it for any beginner. I think this guitar sounds and looks amazing.

I have one complaint. I wish it had a little inlaid fret marker for the third fret like most other guitars. This is not a deal breaker at all. It's just a little thing that I wish was different but it doesn't change my feelings about this guitar. That's how good it is. My only complaints are cosmetic. It would be nice if it had a fancier rosette around the sound hole, or more ornate inlays. But, you cannot argue with the sound and playability.

Original review...

I don't know why this guitar is listed differently than the natural finish model. It's the same guitar. I did not buy this through Amazon but rather at a center for guitars, but only because I wanted to play it first. You see, I bought an Epiphone DR-100 through Amazon several weeks ago. I liked it. I began learning to play, looking at justinguitar.com and freeandeasyguitar.com, sites I have no affiliation with, but I find them full of useful information. So, as I was playing and learning more about guitars, I looked at reviews of other guitars. I began thinking about which guitar I would buy if I should continue playing and outgrow my cheap guitar.

I bought the Epiphone thinking that I wanted to make a minimal investment in case I opted not to play. I now think if should have spent the extra $100 for this one. Why?

First, this is an amazing guitar for the money. It is extremely popular and almost universally praised. I have found reviews in four separate places that had tons of praise for this instrument. There was the rare poor review but I guess that will happen. So, one reason it's worth it to get this guitar over a cheap one is because you can resell it easily and probably for not a lot less than what you paid for it. Even among guitarists who are experienced and have other guitars, this model is still popular. If I was to try to sell the Epiphone, I bet I wouldn't get $50 for it.

Another reason is that this guitar sounds beautiful. It is rich and full. The tone is balanced and has sparkle, especially compared to the cheaper guitars I have heard. My son has a cheap Fender model and the Yamaha beats that one, too. It's not even close or debatable in my opinion. Those aren't really bad guitars. They just aren't as good as this one. It also feels easier to play, to me. I feel like I can fret chords better and that the strings buzz less. So, the action (the distance between the strings and frets) is better, or at least just about right. I have gone through measuring the action with feeler gauges and as far as I can tell, the set up was darn near perfect from the factory.

Additionally, I would tell a beginner to get a decent guitar instead of cheap one. Why fight the guitar while you're trying to learn? And, if you really like your guitar like I like mine, you will want to play more and more often! I enjoy picking it up. The neck feels better. The resonance is amazing. I feel a sense of delight and pleasure when I handle this guitar (that sounded dirtier than I meant it to). This instrument is well made and designed. The tuners hold tune and are sensitive enough to make fine adjustments. The finish (I bought the Sandburst finished model) is beautiful. The frets are not sharp and I don't see any flaws in the binding or other areas of construction.

One small drawback is that the guitar only has one button for a strap, on the bottom of the guitar, so you will need something to attach the strap to the other point. I found a thing called Planet Waves Acoustic Guitar Quick Release System here on Amazon that I bought. It is used to attach to the headstock behind the nut without marring the finish of the guitar. This way you don't have to drill a hole in the body of the guitar and risk altering its tone. It installs easily and works fine.

I think this is a no-brainer for beginners. Get this guitar. If you have to save up for it, do it. Or buy one used. It is one of the most popular guitar models for good reason. If you have any questions, please ask and I will try to answer them. I love this guitar!",2
2664,"I bought this to be able to add an additional cymbal to my kit.

It is nice and sturdy and was easy to setup. I wish the ""L"" portion of the arm was just slightly longer, as it somewhat limits what I can place on it (right now I have a 10"" splash but I struggled when I tried to fit a 14"" crash on it since there wasn't enough clearance from the cymbal to the main stand). All in all a good option but make sure you think about what exactly you want to place on here and whether it will provide enough additional reach.",2
2665,It fits the SM58 perfectly.,2
2666,The only strings I will use!!! I compose and play acoustic fingerstyle and these really ring... they last longer than any other string I use!,2
2667,It's a solid throne at a great price point. It has already outlasted thrones that cost five times as much.,2
2668,"These are amazing for acoustic guitar. They're thin enough to flex against the strings, firm enough to play with control, and they have just the right amount of click while strumming. I use these exclusively now for acoustic. They also have a nice bit of grip without being aggressive. I love them.",2
2669,GOOD,2
2670,"They work as stated,a little tight with my Sennheiser microphone",2
2671,Great pick!  Just what I needed!,2
2672,"Very happy with this effect. I should have ordered this a long time ago instead of the Boss Digital Delay DD-6--this pedal is getting a lot more use primarily with my acoustics.  Small and compact, yet solid like the Boss pedals I've always used over the decades.",2
2673,A+,2
2674,"I have some of the other Joyo Ironman pedals and, just recently acquired this one. The sounds are very good quality and, I might add that for the size of these units they are built like tank. Very convienent that these Ironman pedals are a smaller size, work great on a smaller pedal board. Almost all of the pedals I own are Joyo. They sound Great, built well, metal construction, and, are not nearly expensive as other name brand pedals.
This particular pedal has optional settings not found on other digital pedals, really cool. I haven't added this new one on my board yet but, it will replace the green analog delay.",2
2675,As described.  Good quality,2
2676,"These are my strings of choice, and I've been using them exclusively for years.  Perfect gauge for my aggressive picking style on the low strings (I play mostly rock and metal).  Reasonably priced when compared with the likes of NYXL or coated strings.  Spectacular tones when the strings are brand new, but they typically lose their ""zing"" within a week or two.  I've had them on a guitar for as long as 6 months straight and never had a string break on me.",2
2677,"Good picks nice mix, I play bass and guitar so these mix packs are great",2
2678,nice and sturdy,2
2679,"Very nice capo! It simply works, and has no unnecessary bells + whistles to break or malfunction.",2
2680,"If you tune your guitar with a tuning fork, this is a nice digression from the standard A note. Does take a bit of a whack to get a good audible tone from it.",2
2681,My son says these picks are great to use because of the rubber grippers that make it easier to hold...especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time. Highly recommend!,2
2682,Plenty of room for pedals and nice touch is the mounting option for a power brick.  Cord easily tuck away underneath..,2
2683,"Did a lot of online shopping for a good quality cymbal bag and settled on this one by Gator to go with my Wolfpak drum cases (WP doesn't make a cymbal bag that I know of). This bag is sturdily made and looks like it will hold up to what I will throw it's way. There are removable dividers that are very soft and will bathe up to eight of your pies in comfort. This bag also comes with a shoulder strap and one back-pack style strap that I found curious at first, but actually makes sense as it won't slip as easily as the regular shoulder strap. Of course it has standard handles as well if you want to carry it.

Overall, it looks like this bag will provide me years of service doing what it designed to do. Nice job Gator, and well done Amazon, as usuall!",2
2684,Great little tuner.  Easy to work with and also easy to find.  The price is also right and I recommend.,2
2685,This is such a great capo.  It is exactly as described.  I would recommend it to anyone in need of a ukulele capo.,2
2686,"Ill be honest, I wasn't entirely sold when I purchased this amp. I figured itd have some issues with it or would sound mediocre at best. It arrived with a blown/damaged preamp tube, but it was otherwise in perfect working order. Once I swapped the tubes, it was great. It has a nice Vox-like chime to it, and when its overdriven it has a bit of a Marshall tone. The Tone (presence) knob does a lot to brighten or darken the sound, which is great to dial in the tone you're looking for. The reverb is good now that theyve updated it. Its a great tube amp, especially if you're looking for one to start with. It can be modded (if you choose) too, so it's definitely adaptable.",2
2687,"If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone, this one works well. It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over, and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk. Having the microphone always plugged in, accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voice-over work.",2
2688,"Since I recently took up trumpet again I didn't know what valve oil was presently used by most players,  I saw blue juice advertised everywhere and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  The valves worked well and performance was great.  Service was great too.",2
2689,"Awesome strings, and great package of 10 sets. I immediately used 3 of the sets on my guitars and none of the strings broke. Highly recommended, as this pack will last for a while.",2
2690,"Served the purpose I bought it for. Hopefully this helps protect the amps in my monitor speakers. So far, it has eliminated all noise in my audio.",2
2691,does intended job,2
2692,"My six-year-old started taking drum lessons, and as I wasn't sure how much he wanted to work, I wanted to minimize the money I spent getting something to practice on.  He already had a cheap ""toy quality"" drum set from ToysRUs, which had ""usable"" kik, snare, and tom shells, but no hat, and the kik pedal was a joke.  But replacing the kik pedal and adding this hi-hat, (and damping and tweaking the heads), turned it into a serviceable practice kit.

Given the price, the construction is obviously a bit flimsy, and the cymbals sound awful, but it does work, and the height is better for him than a standard hi-hat.  I did have to provide one of my own cymbal felts though.",2
2693,Worked great!,2
2694,Grea value,2
2695,"YES. I bought some more expensive fancy many capos (nordic essentials) and they came and were metal and poked into my hand AND the handles were under the fretboard, thus getting in the way of the left hand. Got these today after fast shipping. Clearly chinese product, but seems to be sturdy, doesn't over bend the strings, and is comfortable to play with. I am highly satisfied with these affordable plain jane capos. I bought two.
Bridge part is pretty long, but that's not a problem. Also, just make sure to carefully clamp it on so that is seats correctly and doesn't band the strings wonky.",2
2696,product was as advertised,2
2697,Great cable! very robust 1/4in jack that so far has been great! I highly recommend for the price. Rock on!,2
2698,"I strung these up to an open E minor (EBEGBe) on my resonator. They sound great, hold tune, last a while. ... Will buy again!",2
2699,"This machine is much smaller than anticipated.  Roughly the size of a large shoe box. Set up is brainless.  It heats up in less than 5 minutes, and for such a tiny device, it puts out plenty of fog.  Filled up my whole house and set off the fire alarms in about two minutes.

I also like the fact that it's pretty quiet.  I've seen youtube reviews that made me worry that this would be very noisy, but it's not.  Their is an intermittent pump noise and nozzle noise, but really not bad at all.

Highly recommended.",2

2716,"I put a set of Elixir Nanoweb custom light strings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a couple of months ago.  Although I don't play gigs on it, I play the guitar just about every day, or maybe every other day.  The custom lights are wonderful:  great durability, nice tone and projection, easy on the fingers.  I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 3/4 size travel guitar I have.  The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings, thereby putting less stress on the body.  Compared with the light D'Addario strings that came with the guitar, these have a more muffled low E string.  The A string, too, doesn't project as much as the standard strings.  Although I've not tried the extra lights on my full-sized acoustic, I suspect that there, too, the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands.  Even with the custom light set--where the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light set--the bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality.  The thing that most players of Elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability.  They are smoother feeling than non-coated strings, and certainly don't degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings.  The other thing that's important to know, though, is that the Elixirs are excellent at holding a tune, once they're stretched and broken in.  That being said, I'm not sure that I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the bass projection issue:  a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings don't help.  As you might have guessed, though, I'm thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the full-sized acoustic.",2
2717,Husband loves,2
2718,My new pick.  Seems to outlast Dunlop.,2
2719,Good for my Les Paul,2
2720,Nice and sweet..',2
2721,"Pros:
awesome brushed blue metal look
reliable
clear easy to read screen
very sturdy knobs
Input LEDs are helpful when debugging signal routing problems
the effects themselves are good and pack some character, don't seem like standard issue effects
enables use of two effects in parallel or in various routing options
easy to learn
editor is easy to use
no notable noise at all.

cons:
tempo setting sometimes skips decimal places. For example, setting 107.0 BPM may not be possible because MX300 only allows setting 106.9 and 107.1 etc.
preset effects are often overpowering (subjective to your effect preferences).
can't type in exact tempo, even in the editor

other thoughts:
I use it for an analog synthesizer. MX300 is quite good in this regard, especialy its phaser.
I find it best if the mix is low. MX300 can be quite a heavy effect when mix is high.
I reccomend installing and using the MX-Edit editor program (comes with the unit)
1) much easier for tweaking effects than doing this on the unit
2) tweak effects to perfection then save them back to the unit for the show. they can also be saved and loaded from a PC. very useful for recalling effects tweaked for a particular song later.
3) much easier to rename effects to something meaningful to you

These straps work well for that and seem to be sturdy enough to use for a real gig if you wanted to do that.  I just wanted something that I could use to secure my guitar so I can get up and move around without having to put the guitar down each time and this serves the purpose just fine.  It is very flexible and comfortable and I can get a color to match the instrument.  I use strap locks on two guitars but I mounted the strap directly to the Fender Strat I have.  I removed the Fender strap buttons and inserted the small end into the leather taps on the strap and then reattched the strap button to the guitar body.  that way I did not have to stretch out the hole in the strap to put it on by forcing it over the larger part of the strap button.  I have found the leather tabs on all three straps to be thick and sturdy so I don't think the hole will stretch out but better safe than sorry.  For the money you can't beat these straps.",2

With other strings, I needed to change them after any gig or jam session that went more than a couple hours.  If I didn't, the strings sounded really, really dead.  I used to change strings at least weekly, and sometimes more often.

When I play Elixir strings, they sound great when I put them on, and they still sound pretty good when I change them 3-4 months later.",2
2743,"Coming from a steel string guitar world, this was driving me crazy - I was stringing my ukulele for the first time, and no matter how closely I followed the YouTube How-To videos (Cordoba has an excellent one), I would always get the knot on the bridge side correct, but as I  would tension the string, I could see it wanting to slip and come apart. No matter how careful I was, I could never get used to how ""sloppy"" things on the bridge ended up looking, and I was constantly wondering ""did I do this wrong/is my whack stringing job affecting the sound of the instrument"" (the fact that nylon strings stretch like crazy and take forever to settle in didn't help matters).

Not only do these bridge beads eliminate any doubt that the strings are correctly tied (provided you follow the extremely simple instructions), but the bridge ends up looking much cleaner and professional. Plus, you end up with a cool little plastic case for your snuff. :)

Seriously, it's surprising to me that for as long as nylon stringed instruments have been around, these bridge beads (or something similar) hasn't been standard issue for decades - I can't help believing this system improves the instrument sound, because it eliminates so much slop.

Unless you are the die hard ""roll your own tobacco"" type, these tailpiece beads are well worth the price!",2

1. You can eliminate 90% of the ground buzz problems you have with this device.  I have a keyboard that has a constant buzz.  Plug it into this input and enable lift and ISO and voila! No more buzz.  Works better than the EbTech by far and is better than a ground lift on a DI box.
2. It's reversible.  You can have one input to two outputs OR flip the 180 switch and put two inputs in to one output (just ignore the labeling).  That's incredibly useful.

On my way now to buy my 3rd box... the others have found permanent homes cleaning up buzzes.",2

While the case is a  little on the pricey side, it's worth it. With cases I've had in the past, the lid pulls at the lip and eventually becomes misshapen but there's a seam over where the lid and bottom meet which I expect will keep the case from malfunctioning. There are three beautiful latches on the front and one in the back for extra security. One of the latches also acts as a lock and comes with one small key. I figure it will be difficult (but not impossible) to break into the locked latch. The handle feels very sturdy. My only complaint is that one of the latches was missing a bolt when it arrived, so it was loose on the case. I was issued a full refund and will be re-purchasing the case very soon. If it hadn't been for that bolt, this case wold have easily earned 5 stars!",2

I have sweaty hands and my Martin and Fender strings would deteriorate quickly.  This is simply not an issue anymore for me.  It's like a dream come true.  I don't care that they cost a lot more than uncoated strings, they are worth every penny to me as I play my guitar  a couple of hours a day and I want good strings.  I even made a video about them that I plan to post on YouTube.  I don't usually rave about any product I buy but I make an exception for Elixir.  I did recently purchase an D'Addario EXP coated 80/20 12 string set.  I have not installed them yet on my new Martin 12 string but when I do I plan to do a comparison with Elixirs.  Until then, these Nanoweb strings are my all time favorites.",2
2758,Like all Pedaltrain Boards this one is perfect especially for travel specifically air travel. I'll use it with 3 MXR Bass Pedals and a Polytune Noir and in some instances a Airturn Ipad page turner. It really beats throwing 2-4 pedals on the floor.,2
2759,"This clarinet has a beautiful matte finish. It came with everything pictured, everything you need to play it right out of the box! For the price I paid, highly recommended! However, it took 9 days from order date to arrive. I've never had to wait that long for an amazon shipment. :(",2
2760,the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended,2

2768,I  don't believe there is a better mic for the money available today.  You are getting a lot of quality for not a lot of money. A good quality mic is one of the most important pieces of equipment you need and this is the fastest way to get it without spending a small fortune.,2

2772,"It's adequate for the purpose I bought it (practicing in the passenger seat of the car on long trips).  4 stars instead of 5 because it's a pain in the butt to tune, due to the location of the tuners, and because calling it an ""acoustic"" is a bit misleading, since it puts out no more sound than an uplugged electric guitar if not plugged into an amp. However, i do like it.",2
2773,I like the SN-2. Just thought I'd try the SN-8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed.  Snark tuners have always performed well for me.  I play guitar and ukulele.  I've used and own many tuners and brands.  The Snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat.  I usually buy several at a time and give them as gifts to my musician friends.  For anyone who plays acoustic guitar - these things are so handy.,2
2774,This very economical device does everything for $40 that my friends pay $170 for. I'm sold on ACTONE.,2
2775,Good at that price.,2

to do so. I get long life and very good clarity from D'Addarios.",2
2777,"Without getting into the physics of strings, OK a bit, the wider a string is, the more tension it takes to tune it to a given pitch. If you tried to tune your [thinner] E string down to B [or even drop D], think about how 'loose' it stars to feel. If you play 5 string bass, that B string should be nice and wide, like these, that use a .135 B. Sets with thinner strings are OK, but will be at a lesser tension. This doesnt matter for some, is preferred by some, so your mileage may vary.

Great strings, not flippy floppy!!",2
2778,I amusing often.,2
2779,As with all SKB fantastic!,2
2780,"I am very happy with this purchase.  The neck is a bit longer than I expected.  Other than that I have 0 complaints.  The guitar is lightweight, and produces a nice tone.  A really great instrument for the beginning bass player (which I am).  Solid value!  Pick this up!",2

This is it - by a mile. I love this mic. From first take to finished product my editing time has been reduced to almost nothing. It is a little bright for my taste, but nothing some minor EQ doesn't easily fix. I don't do drums, guitars, or God forbid sing. I talk, and this is perfect. Better than the ribbons I have used.",2
2789,"I wanted a kick around ""all"" plastic uke for camping and hiking. I had tried another leading brand (Waterman) and was marginally pleased with it, so I gave that one away and got the black matte Woodi USA, and I'm loving it. I'm mostly a picker ranter than a strummer, so sustain is very important to me.  I didn't expect an excellent sustain on a uke with a plastic fretboard, but I was pleasantly surprised with the Woodi.

It has great intonation and a decent tone.  The strings are, as expected, cheap plastic nylon.  I have a set of Martins ready to put on it but so far the original strings are ""okay"" - I'm sure the tone will be vastly improved with the Martins but even with the original strings the uke sings remarkably well.  It enjoys the outdoors and is substantially more durable than most other ukes, especially those with high end woods.

I highly recommend the Woodie USA for a basic uke!",2
2790,"It has the comfort, look, and smell of real leather. This is what I wanted. If you are like me and do greatly prefer this over synthetic materials, then this is an excellent lower priced guitar strap. Also, at 5'10"" I found the length was perfect. Overall, for the price, if you are not trying to be an uptight contrarian ... you will find this an enjoyed product for the price.",2

That was her problem for years, because she had a lot of trouble trying to control the air flow. She tried with different reed for years but with little success except for the plasticover reed, that helped her a little. Then I decided to buy her this reeds and the results were incredible. Now she's trying with a new 3.5 reed and I think it'll be even better.",2
2807,"Originally I hoped that this WCP-60V would be useful with an F-hole resonator guitar (it was not) but I also wanted to try it for acoustic guitar.

I bought both this WCP-60V and the WCP-60G. The 60G clips on easier and has much stronger output. However, after trying many different placement options, I ended up choosing this 60V for two different types of acoustic guitars.

For the 60V pickup, you probably want to use a compressor (I use the Mooer Yellow Comp) or cab-emulation pedal to get better sound and bring it to life. Multiband EQ is also a good additional option.

Comparing the 60G and 60V, the 60G was louder, fuller and had more bass. However, even the best 60G positioning did not really sound very natural or balanced. The 60V was better for that.

While guitar picking worked for both pickups, strumming tended to sound unnatural and distorted. I could not find any position where strumming sounded good.

BTW, I found that the most natural sound when using the WCP-60V with my Seagull Excursion Natural Folk SG acoustic guitar was obtained by placing the pickup near the far back of the bottom of the soundhole and then hooking the curved clip firmly over the inner soundhole brace so that the pickup was very flat and locked in place as much as possible. The pickup was angled backward at about 60 degrees from the bottom string.",2
2808,Great for down tuning.,2
2809,I looked for a six channel mixer that would not kill my budget for my podcast and this is working out just fine. Great price!,2
2810,Great product. Thanks.,2
2811,"I love these things. I have purchased several Snarks of all different types. Fast, accurate and a joy to use. My young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one. All Snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner. The SN-2 also has a built in mic for use with any instrument, such as trumpet, sax, clarinet, etc. I have other, more expensive clip on tuners, but the Snark is by far my favorite.",2
2812,"This amp is defiantly a keeper. wonderful sound out of a solid state amp. i could go on and on about how amazing it is but youll find that out on your own if you get the amp so instead ill start with the cons. there's not a lot but some worth knowing.
first, this amp is pretty hefty. Line 6 couldve given you a bit more then a single handle to haul this thing around. perhaps some handle bars on the left and right side of the amp would be more efficient.
Next, the interface could be a little more user friendly. I figured it out on my own but i can imagine some people would really struggle to grasp how to function it. not a huge deal but still...
Thats about all the cons i can really think of at the moment. I just bought it so ill have to see if it stands the test of time. But i couldn't be happier right now. It even has very accurate built in tuner. Also the song presets are simply a blast. I spent about an hour scrolling through all of them saying things like ""hey! johnny b good! i love that song! oh cool gimme shelter by the stones!!"" and they all sound very accurate to the studio recordings they are mimicking.
If your looking for an amp thatll cover any live performance just short of a giant professional show involving a crowd of thousands of people then thisll will do the trick. (if your playing for that many people then you can afford a bigger amp anyway.) This amp will drown out a drummer if you get the 120wt version that i have.
In terms of price this just cant be beat either. 120 wts and i got it used for 300$. thats simply an amazing deal with all the awesome gadgets you get with this.
One last note though, I highly recommend getting the footpedal with it. this way you can use the loopinig feature, tuner, and presets without having to stoop down and change the settings by hand. especially the looping feature. in fact there's no way to really use the looping feature without the pedal so go for the footpedal and you'll thank yourself.
Once again... get this amp!",2

2820,"I have only used this once on a low volume gig, but I was impressed with the transparency- I had to keep checking that the thing was on! I guess I'm used to proximity effect, and obviously this setup doesn't allow that. The level is pretty low for a condenser, but I don't have any other head worn mics to compare it to. Build quality is excellent, it fits comfortably and the boom stays put. I finally got sick of fiddling with mic stands for my seated gigs, this thing sure doesn't look cool but for ease of use and movement, I think I've been converted.  I go wired into my pa, so I hook the preamp onto my belt loop, and forget about it. Very happy so far, will report back if my opinion changes.",2
2821,"For some reason the only usable setting is the tweed (fender), the other two have way too much gain and sound fizzy. The fender cleans are all I need though. I played a gig with this a few days after I bought it. I needed an XLR out and I didn't want to pay Tech 21 $300 for their limited edition whatever series blonde. I'm not sure why the just don't add XLR outs to their existing line of character series pedals. I went straight into the board and it sounded fine for a small bar gig. Although I did break two strings in the same set, but I can't blame behringer for that. I was hoping to get a bassman sound out of it, but that didn't happen. It has a generic middle of the road fender clean sound, it takes pedals well and I suggest adding some to bring out your guitar's tone in the mix.",2
2822,Awsome head tone hard rock style of play.,2
2823,"I have to say I *am* impressed with how good this little mic actually is. It delivers much more nuance and vocal definition than I had expected from a mic at this price point. I needed a mic primarily for a bit of voiceover work here in my home studio and didn't really want to spend a whole lot on it, but I have now actually tracked a couple of song vocals with it as well and have been pleasantly surprised. I did get the Dragonpad pop filter and the Shure foam windscreenkind of doubling up on the filtering there, but it's working out nicely. I record straight into Logic 9 Pro via a TC Electronic mic pre that gives me a pretty decent signal path. What can I say? It's a surprisingly good mic for the money. Recommended!",2

However, after going back to these original OEM Shure windscreens, I don't know what I was thinking trying to save a couple bucks.  These fit perfectly and work great to reduce wind noise and plosives.  Very well worth the few extra dollars.",2

I only have one complaint, which is why it didn't get 5 stars. The high-end frequency boost on this microphone makes some vocalists sound very shrill. This has only happened with a couple of people, and I have heard that this decreases dramatically if you upgrade the tube in the microphone. I would not hesitate to buy this microphone again if mine was lost or stolen!",2
2840,"Bought to turn set up an old junk electric for playing slide.

As other reviewers have said, depending on your fretboard width, it might overhang either side of your nut, making the strings hover slightly off the fretboard.  In other words, if you were to try to fret them, they'd slip down the side of the neck.

But here's the thing about slide guitar- that point doesn't matter.  If you were setting it up so you could also play it fretted, then you wouldn't be using one of these anyway.  Would it look a little better if it didn't overhang?  Sure.  But it really doesn't bother me at all as it is.

Also, the price is pretty reasonable, too.",2

It is incredibly light, and very power efficient - it barely gets warm in use. Love it!",2

Since I don't currently need a foot switch I set that sucker aside and used the cord to plug my guitar into my amp.
Turned it on...
HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
No, that's not right.  It was actually more of a
HUMMMMMYBUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
It was terrible.  I asked around and was told the hum was ""Normal. 60 cycle.""

I tried fiddling with the knobs but nothing would get rid of the buzzhumm.  I was starting to feel depressed.  I thought there was something wrong with my house's electricity.
I was so bummed.  I was just about ready to start looking for some kind of filter ($) or ANYTHING that would let me play my guitar without the buzz.

But then my wife figured out that it was the CORD.  That ""free"" cord that CAME WITH THE AMP.  I switched it out for a nicer one (the one she uses to connect her bass to her amp) and VIOLA!

NOW my guitar and amp sound SO AWESOME!
When I was dealing with the buzz I couldn't even play with any of the ""effects"" because it was just too painful.
Now I am amazed by the incredible sounds I get out of this amp!

It is plenty loud (if that's what you want) and pure and clean (if that's what you want) and has some reverb, mid contour, drive and ""more drive.""
Now that I've tossed that cord aside I'm enjoying every sound this amp makes.

The ONLY hesitation I would have about buying this amp is: there is no headphone jack!  There should be a head phone jack.  They just cheaped out and didn't put one in.

The amp is a bit bigger than I imagined, and pretty heavy.
I like it a lot.",2

The nickel in these strings make them tight, but not too tight to the point where you feel like you need to modify your playing at all. I was a bit worried that I might snap a string, but I got used to it. The strings hold their sound quite well.

I like these guitar strings a lot. I hadn't really tried D'Addario until a month ago, but I've been really impressed with their line of products.",2

I might not have the ideal setup to try it, as I am using an electric nylon guitar where most would be playing steel strings, but I think my test gives a good indication of what kinds of sounds you can get out of this pedal.

The pedal feels solidly built, knobs are nice, the bypass button has a nice tactile feel to it and a nice clicking sound. It can be run off a 9V battery (included) or via a power supply. I often find the battery a bit of a tight squeeze right up against the circuitboard in the Joyo pedals, so some care needs to be taken.

As for sound quality, I think it has an interesting character and some nice sonic possibilities.

What is the compressor sound? Well. I'll leave my amateur playing to show what the pedal can do.",2

2858,"*UPDATE* I had some reservations about buying a 25 foot cable because of signal deterioration, but I needed one that long because of room restrictions. I have a Seymour Duncan pickup booster, so I knew I could always use that if need be. I'm happy to say that there is little to no signal loss with this cable, so I can use my pickup booster to boost my single coils. This cable performs as good or better than any other cable I've ever bought, and I've bought just about all the top name cables. 11/30/2014

Fender Instrument Cables have always been my preferred choice primarily because there is no signal loss. Top quality tweed cable that look great, is easy to coil and doesn't kink up while being used. If there's one thing I hate it's wasting time fighting with cables.",2

2860,"I am a huge fan of locking tuners.  Every guitar I own (6) has had their stock tuners replaced with locking tuner because the guitars stay in tune much better, and it is no longer a dreaded chore to change strings.  I chose this model because Paul Reed Smith guitars told me it is the model that fits my guitar without modifications.  I don't mind modifying but if I don't need to, I don't.  The Grover Rotomatics use a dual shaft system where the inner shaft has a smaller hole, and the outer shaft has a larger hole.  When you rotate the inner shaft by turning the button, this created a binding between the two shafts and locks the string in place.  It works, but I prefer the other style whereby you turn a nut on the back side to loosen or tighten the grip on the string.  Schallers use this other method.  Again, these do work, and the advantage is they are stealthy.  They look original from the back as opposed to being obvious locking tuners.",2

2871,"Works well in noisy environment, it clearly picks up sounds from strings.  I think I will order couple more.",2
2872,"I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this instrument. None of it was done ""hands on"" though. I chose this Ukulele because of the design, and the descriptions of it's tonality as well as endorsements from professional players. All of the pros chose this brand and model due to the warm tone. It's a fun little instrument with a distinctly Hawaiian tone without being ""tinny"". I play classical guitar. I also have a travel classical guitar, however, even that is too large to play comfortably when actively traveling (By ""active"" I don't mean playing at the hotel when I get there, I mean playing in the car as I'm going there).

I first started looking at the Baritone Ukes because I felt they would be easier to play being set up with the four highest strings of a guitar. Then I saw the Guitaleles. There were a different tuning than a guitar, so that was out for me. There were the Ukes that had 6 strings but with two singles and two doubled up... there were the Ukes that had 4 string pairs (8 strings altogether)... I considered all of them.

All of these proved too expensive for a first Uke. As many many others have stated to go with a cheaper one to start with. So then I looked at a Tenor. The tenor can be tuned either gCEA (standard) or like a baritone (DGBE). I was pretty set on a tenor... then I listened to a comparison of a Uke tuned to gCEA and GCEA (high ""g"" vs low ""G"") and although I liked both, I really did like the high ""g"" more than I thought I would. So then I started looking at the sopranos. Ok, maybe the soprano was too small. I REALLY wanted something small, but not toy-like. I wanted more notes than that could offer. So then I got to seriously considering a Concert Uke. Small, but large enough, and in the right price range. I could start with the high ""g"" tuning and switch it out with a low ""G"" at any time. I could also get close to mandolin tuning (one of my other ""toys"") with available CGDA strings (also read about tuning a Concert Uke to mandolin and the problems with GDAE tunings with the high ""E"" having too much tension for this size of Uke - however, the standard mandolin strings GDAE are available for soprano sized Ukes).

Anyway, so I ended up with this one and so far am very satisfied with it. Am planning on getting that lower G string as well as the CGDA set after I mess around with this standard stuff for awhile... then again, I just may get another one to set up differently.... Cus this really does have a nice sound!

This comes with a gig bag. The bag is pretty thin and doesn't have any cushioning, but if you are on a budget, it will keep your Ukulele from immediate damage - water, something lightly hitting it, air moisture changes, etc. It just won't protect it much if you throw it in the back of a car with other luggage. By the time I do any traveling with it hopefully I will have a hard case by then cus this bag won't protect it enough for hard traveling (luggage, pets, and such).

Oh yeah, and tuning it was easy. Within a week the strings were staying in tune and didn't need much fine tuning after that.",2
2873,exacty what I thought it would be It is black pads instead of white but I do like the look,2
2874,AAA,2
2875,"Great strings for roots, country and blues. Lively and bright - lots of thick twang on my humbucker-loaded ash Tele. Love the tone and the price is right too. Thought I was a GHS Boomers man for life...these are making me second guess that commitment. I use the 10-46 set and they last - stay in tune and best of all - NO BREAKS in the 10 + sets bought. Very impressed thus far. Highly recommended for Fender or Fender-esuqe electric guitars.",2

2878,"Got these to replace my Martin SP 7100 strings which I found to be really hard on your fingers.  These Elixir  strings are simply amazing.  I have them on my Martin DX1KAE  and coming down one gauge from 12's to 11's makes all the difference in the world.  Right when you put them on your guitar,  these strings have the most beautiful tone I have never heard. Chords and single notes sound so full, crisp and clear. They are very comfortable to play. They made me a fan.",2
2879,"The instrument has a nice place to sit, and the bar at the top locks in place so the instrument can't be accidentally knocked out of the stand.  Sturdy, well made, with non slip feet.  Adjustable, so it can hold a range of instrument sizes securely.  I am happy with my choice.",2

I find putting a small crease in the right spot makes them perfect for me. Having several basses, I wanted the dozen so I could put a few in each pick-box. These were just what I needed.",2
2885,"The capo I recieved is Jim Dunlop brand, which is something that other reviewers were having problems with.  That being said, I have never used a capo before, so I don't know if this is expected or not, but it seems really difficult to move to and from different places.  It's not too bad to get on the first fret you put it on, but taking it off, and moving to a different fret, it's pretty difficult.  It holds down the strings well though, with no buzzing sounds.",2
2886,Sound great.,2
2887,"I have had this a few days and putting it through it's paces. This is a wonderful piece of gear for the price. The sound quality is quite excellent. It's a little warmer and fuller than a SnowBall. It's much smaller and easier to position. And, it's got monitoring function for headphones. That's a lot of features. It has three sound signature settings (one is dead flat) and they are very useful. Some have noted disappointment that it's plastic frame rather than metal. I do not get that criticism. I mean, portability is one of it's two claims to great value, so who wants to lug around a heavy ball of metal to have metal? This looks great and is very well made. The plastic is high quality and looks good, and besides, when you drop the mic (and you will eventually drop the mic), this does not have all the added weight of a lot of metal to add to the shock for the internals.

The stand is adequate and kind of good looking. It's well made and designed.

The other great thing about this mic is it's number one advantage over most other mics for purposes people are likely interested in this: you can plug it right into an IOS device because it works with lightening connection. That's amazing. That means I can take my iPad with an app like TwistedWave (great great app) and get high quality sounds right into my iPad while monitoring with headphones out the back of the mic. That's a whole lot of function for $99.

Sounds great. Loads of options. Attractive. Great size for not taking up too much space on desk. If you want to pay a bit more and get better sound, get an AT2020 from Audio Technica. But this delivers excellent sounds with portability, smaller size, and that cool ability to record right to an IOS device (if you like).",2
2888,DMX was important for me.  Good quality for the price.  The cord is not detachable.  The addressing is easy for DMX or use the color modes.,2
2889,Thanks.,2
2890,"These are great, hold the strap on, but may not work on every strap button.  On my Dean, no way, the size of the strap buttons makes the leather strap fit nicely, no room for these blocks.  If the strap opening was any wider I'd just have to consider stitching it tighter.  But on my Fender knock offs and an Epiphone these blocks fit just fine.  I like the rubber; it keeps the strap from rotating around too much, which is usually when my strap comes loose in the first place.",2
2891,"Decent padding but the Epiphone ones are better.
These are nicer in that the zipper pulls are in the shape of a Fender logo'd pic. However the bag is too wide so telecasters and stratocasters literally move around in there. Also, there's no extra canvas protector where the headstock is (like the Epiphone bag).

I'm only keeping it because keeping the same brand seems to help when selling guitars.",2
2892,"Really nice amp for it's size.  My old practice amp finally bit the dust and I needed something else.  i bought this because it was cheap and seemed to have good reviews.  And for the price it really is a great amp.  It is small and compact and sounds pretty darn good.  I was a little surprised when it arrived.  I did not realize that it was designed so it could be set on it's side and used as a wedge speaker.  I would buy this again, but seeing how well it is build I doubt iwil l have to.",2
2893,"Please also see my review of the Suzuki Promaster Low F.

Received my Promaster in key of A last night and it is
 remarkable.  Being a higher key than the Low F, it also
has a brighter, sweeter sound. As usual, Amazon provided
excellent delivery service and,  as always, the finest products.
 My next key will be b flat.
  I can't help but repeat myself:  This is a wonderful
 instrument. You have to play it yourself to appreciate it.
  It is very expressive in its dynamic range, because it bends
  easily and lends itself to playing chords very nicely.
  I have played many harps so it only took me 20 minutes to
 realize the bright output of this harp. It requires just
 a bit more control of breath to maintain the mellow quality
 of the tone, easily learned.
 Mr. Suzuki has dedicated himself to really refine his instruments
 to the point where they are truly the best they can be.
  Again, I thank Mr. Suzuki for this Promaster in the wonderful key of A",2

One star reduced for durability, though. I keep my drums in sheepskin-lined soft cases and the lining tends to degrade the sticking power of these gels. So the effective usable time is pretty short--maybe 5 or 6 gigs.",2

2911,"I am a pedal junkie. I admit it. Many, many pedals have been auditioned, purchased, discarded, and retrieved. But I have never owned a fuzz pedal, ever. But there was a lightning deal on Donner pedals, so I ordered one at what I thought was an extremely good price. I didn't think that for the price I paid that it could be that great of a pedal, but it seemed like a good way to dip my toe into the fuzz pond. I received it promptly thanks to Prime shipping, and at first glance was impressed by the packaging, and upon opening was equally impressed with the looks of the pedal. It was tiny but was somewhat hefty for it's size. It wasn't cheap or chintzy feeling at all..
I'm not a pedal snob.  A pedal that is usable and controllable and sounds and feels good will find a place on my pedalboard. And the Stylish Fuzz does all that.. It has a great sound (think ""Spirit in the Sky"" only a little smoother). It isn't harsh or raspy, it's full and warm at it's middle settings, but absolutely fuzzy. The tone control can change the tone from muffled to bright and there is plenty of volume available .I've read that some fuzzes can be particular about where they are in the chain of pedals and how they react with other pedals, but it seems to be happy wherever i've placed it.
I don't know about other fuzzes, because I haven't used any, but the bar has been set fairly high with the Stylish Fuzz.",2

I put a system in each of my two Taylor guitar cases, along with a digital humidity monitor.
Over the next 6 weeks, I checked the case humidity, using the digital monitor. The humidity always stayed between 47 and 52 %.
After several weeks the humidity paks have remained soft and flexible. If they ever get hard, they should be replaced.
I have read where some folks have restored them by exposing them to more humidity but have not tried this (yet).
Replacement paks are available from Amazon for a very reasonable price. They just slip into the bags furnished with the original system.",2
2925,"This is the perfect solution to ""pick slipping."" All of us have had the occasional pick slip from our fingers, often at the most inopportune moment. Many pick makers have put etched designs on their picks, and these certainly help, but it's a maze trying to find the right texture and thickness and shape to suit your needs.
For many, many players, the Fender Medium is the pick of choice, and has been for many years. A few manufacturers make ""grippy"" stick-ons for picks, which do work, but are a little small, and go away with the pick's demise; others offer a dizzying array of choices and you must essentially try them all to find the one that works for you.
This Pick World has a near equivalent of a Fender Medium embedded in a rubber sleeve, giving a firm, effortless grip and just the right amount of pick exposed. When the pick inevitably breaks or wears away, a new Fender Medium can be inserted, or more of these picks can be purchased.
The only drawback is that they appear to be available only in 3-packs, and there is no holder or case designed for them.",2

I've read some reviews that state this newer version isn't as good as the old, or some even say that the sound change is too extreme... I don't think that's the case with either. This sounds as good as any version I've used and the tone adaption can be dialed to a little or a lot.

The installation process was daunting to me but luckily my GS mini already had a perfect sized hole drilled in body for the input jack. The rest of the installation was very simple.

It is a nice little beginner style- so don't expect that it will be for concerts...also, with any stringed instrument, it will not stay in tune for the first week or so, so don't be discouraged when it needs tuned a few times. It isn't a toy, unless you treat it like one. I've been tuning and playing it when I get mine out, just to see and I would definitely recommend it to anyone starting out. It has a nice little sound and the colors aren't bad. Is it the most top of the line? No, but it isn't a piece of junk if you've got any idea how to care for an instrument. I haven't changed out her strings yet and I'm still not seeing how they're so bad? Again, maybe not top of the line, but nothing wrong with them as far as I've played.

2945,"This tool saves me time and makes it easier and quicker to tune my drums.  It will NOT tune your drums for you nor is it in any way a substitute for traditional tuning.  What it will do is FACILITATE your tuning efforts.

First, and foremost, and this is mandatory.  You MUST lubricate your lugs.  I use Lug Lube but any lightweight non-graphite oil will work.  If you fail to do this then this tool is of less value since any rusty or sticky lugs will have more resistance than others, defeating the purpose of the tool.
Second, the tool is NOT precise.  It does however get you close very quickly.  It makes for a quick starting point.  It's precision is much better IMO for higher tension uses than low tension ones.  Hence, it does a better job on snares and smaller toms than it does bigger ones.  But again, remember its purpose and limitations: it gets you quickly to a near-tuned state, from which you can now spend your time tuning.  I use it in concert with a DrumDial.

In summary, I like this product and use it nearly every time I tune.  If used properly it saves time and pro ides convenience.",2

2967,"You won't find many outboard solutions to your live sound challenges that will top this product. Yes, it is easy to use and more importantly, yes, it delivers clarity, punch and definition to your powered speakers.",2
2968,"Used it a few times already.  The blue stand is rubbery and has 4 different shaped sides depending on what you need.  Big enough for basses, nice soft grippy pad.",2
2969,"I use Studio 1 for my music, and this MPX16 was the perfect addition to my equipment. Now I can add all 16 percussion instruments to my two Akais and have it all right before me. Works great and was very easy to set up!",2
2970,"I have seen so many reviews of this device from people who have obviously not used it, and thought I should set the record straight (couldn't resist...)  so this device sits in your signal path from your guitar and your amp and records whatever you play when you click the button, and then it lets you cycle through the recorded sections and repeat them, much like the TC Electronics ditto looper (awesome pedal too) does.  What it does that that pedal does not do is provide a Bluetooth interface to your iPhone or iPad to save off riff ideas and share them with your friends, etc.  I haven't exercised that part of what it does yet, but I can tell you that the recording and playback functionality is fantastic.  Plus you could record three different parts, cycle through them on playback, and then add different effects from your pedals (if you have it towards the front of your chain) and experiment with settings on those other pedals.  For the price paid you can do an incredible amount with this pedal.  I would recommend it to anyone, but I will say that paired with a Ditto Looper type pedal you can get some serious infinite loops of interesting sounds going.",2
2971,I've tried many pickups.  That includes the Baggs M1... needs gain; the M1A... sounds harsh to my ears; and this M80.  This hits the sweet spot for me.,2
2972,"This pedal is a must have for any serious guitarist. It makes everything sound level, and brings a clear tone. Makes guitar sound 100 times better. I have a s***ty knockoff Strat that I use, this makes even it sound good. It doesn't matter that it's plastic, it is well built, as long as you don't stomp the hell out of it. I am a growing fan of Behringer. They get a bad rap from alot of people, but most of the time they are just deuches lol. This company makes a good pedal comparable to most expensive brands.

The reason you don't see this pedal in a lot of music stores, or why music shop owners speak ill of this pedal, is because they cannot get the profit margin that they would like from it.",2
2973,"Looks just like the original. I replaced the other and do like the gold. Haven't put any time in on it, but plugged it in to make sure it was all working and switched it back and forth a few times and all is good.",2
2974,These strings sound great.  They don't show any signs of rusting or coming apart.  I think they are the best strings for this price.,2
2975,Very simple and functional. Mounts easily and is very strong. Keeps your guitar out of harms way and off the floor area. Keep your guitar handy and you will play it more often. In the case; Out of sight out of mind.,2
2976,"I am pleased with this product. Overall, for the money I spent on it (which wasn't expensive at all) it worked as advertised. There isn't anything negative I can say about it.",2
2977,fine,2
2978,Great picks..especially for playing guitar!,2
2979,"I am guitar player and I have used Korg tuners for many years. I had one of the old black CA-1 tuners that lasted for well over a decade.  Finally, the screen faded and I purchased a new model CA-1 several years ago.  The red ""on/off"" button failed - it got sticky and wouldn't easily turn on or off.  (This is the older model I am complaining about, not the Korg CA-40.)

So, the new CA-40 came today and I like it a lot. It is a tad larger than the older model. It has a fold-out tab on the back so you can stand it up at an angle.  It seems to me that the digital pointer/indicator is more stable and sensitive in a good way. It feels like I can dial the tuning in with more precision.

I recommend this tuner.  I like this one better than other model.",2
2980,"These strings have a nice bright sound and were very easy to install.  They are quite long but nothing too complicated to wind up.  We were recommended this particular brand so I'm very glad we ordered them, we'll continue to get this same set when is time to change them again.",2
2981,"I like round base mic stands in my recording studio. Large tripod stands just get in the way in the studio where things are already crowded.

The clutch is the weakest part on these stands, it is possible to get it tight enough so they don't drop or loosen in use but it is too easy to over-tighten the clutch which breaks it permanently. None the less, these stands are half the price of competing Atlas models and with care these can last a long time. I use them for mic stands around my drum set, stands for our headphone stations and when our band is practicing we use them for holding vocal mics.

In the studio I like to slip an Olympic size 10 pound bar bell weight on to them for extra stability. For the price these can't be beat.",2
2982,"Great value! Using it as a back up stage mic. Sound very good and for the price it can't be beat. It does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics, but gets the job done when needed.",2
2983,Brand new and great price,2
2984,Seat is on the soft side,2
2985,"Absolutely beautiful strap, adds instant class to the guitar. Well made and reasonably priced.",2
2986,"Works perfectly, looks great",2
2987,Change the pickups to what you want and it cant be beat.,2
2988,Works fine.  I hope this enough characters to satisfy Amazon's algorithm.,2
2989,"Great strings, great price. What more could you want?",2
2990,"This thing does everything I needed it to do. I can play my guitar or bass along with an mp3 player (an ability I lost with my current amp and pedal set up,) or mix audio sources for other applications. Nice build quality, easy set up, and simple intuitive controls make this a versatile tool as well as a good introduction to using mixers. Best $40 I've spent in a long time!",2
2991,Does the job!,2
2992,"Warm strings, easy to produce a sound.  Resin builds up nicely.

They do tend to stretch a lot and fall out of tune.  Give them time.  We like these.",2
2993,the leather at the bottom is so thick it was real hard to put it on. I had to get my knife out and cut the slit bigger,2
2994,excellent value. high quality.,2
2995,For the price these are fantastic.,2
2996,"Still breaking it in, coupled with a Mullard EL84 on my little Epiphone Valve Jr.  It's a little raspy but have found some good tones, I'm optimistic!  Thanks for offering!",2
2997,Great strings.,2
2998,This is by far the cleanest boost pedal I've found. I run it between 8 and 9 o'clock to boost during chorus when I want just an extra volume boost and it's perfect!,2
2999,"If you have sweaty hands and pick that you are using always slips off your fingers, this pick is perfectly made for you. It has an ultra max grip that it won't slip off your fingers while using. Love it!",2
